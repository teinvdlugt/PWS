1
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:51,068
Daddy.

2
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,367
Daddy.

3
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,703
Leland.

4
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,332
Daddy.

5
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,543
Leland.

6
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:13,924
Daddy. Daddy. Leland.

7
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,801
Leland.

8
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:25,811
Leland.

9
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,813
Yeah.

10
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,399
You have the right to an attorney.

11
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,318
I waive that right.

12
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,781
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

13
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,828
Anything you say may be held
against you in a court of law.

14
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,454
Do you understand?

15
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,957
Yes, of course, I do.

16
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,881
On Friday morning, March 3rd,

17
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,634
did you go
to Calhoun Memorial Hospital?

18
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,554
Yes.

19
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,807
Why did you go there?

20
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,311
I was looking for someone.

21
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,105
Who were you looking for?

22
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,900
The man who killed my daughter.

23
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,155
Did you know his name?

24
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,781
No.

25
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,910
Yes. I do now.

26
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,496
Jacques Renault.

27
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:32,336
What made you think
he killed Laura?

28
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,005
You arrested him.

29
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,264
Leland...

30
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:49,353
...did you kill Jacques Renault?

31
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,317
He killed my Laura.

32
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,906
Have you ever experienced

33
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,159
absolute loss?

34
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,829
I doubt that any one of us
is a stranger to grief.

35
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,332
No, more than grief.

36
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,962
It's deep down.

37
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,838
Inside.

38
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,259
Every cell screams.

39
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,594
You can hear...

40
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,264
...nothing else.

41
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,895
Yes.

42
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,900
I ki...

43
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,944
I killed him.

44
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,822
Yes.

45
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,867
Yes, yes, yes.

46
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,121
Yes.

47
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,172
He'll plead temporary insanity.

48
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,799
We'll need a psychiatric exam.

49
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,593
I'll tell you one thing,
parents should not bury their children.

50
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,762
Anyone who's been through
what Leland has is...

51
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,307
Do you approve of murder,
Dr. Hayward?

52
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,933
No.

53
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,064
Hey, doc.

54
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,402
- How are you, Andy?
- Fine.

55
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,571
Great. Fine.

56
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,198
What's the problem?

57
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,328
It's kind of personal.

58
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,788
I'm your doctor, Andy.

59
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,584
It's about my sperms test.

60
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,586
Yes?

61
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,088
You know, I flunked.

62
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,716
That's not the precise term for it.

63
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,177
Well, I was just wondering

64
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,096
if it's the kind of test
you can take over.

65
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,224
You know, like a driver's exam.

66
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:56,396
I mean, I've been wearing boxer shorts
every day just like you told me.

67
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,273
You wanna give it another shot?

68
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,650
Yes, sir. I would.

69
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,446
I'll need to take a sample with me.

70
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,907
- Right now?
- Put it in a brown bag.

71
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,992
I'll wait in the car.

72
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,498
Hmp!

73
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,045
Lucy, I've got
a garbage truck here on...

74
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,215
Oh, shut up.

75
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,802
Our judge arrives this afternoon.

76
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,012
Clinton Sternwood.

77
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,056
Travels the circuit in a Winnebago.

78
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,100
Outdoors enthusiast?

79
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,602
Last of the frontiersmen.

80
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,312
They broke the mold.

81
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,818
I only got bail hearing for Leland
and Leo's competency examination.

82
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,486
Will Leland get bail?

83
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,531
Well, Harry, that's up to
your state prosecutor.

84
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,408
That'd be Daryl Lodwick.

85
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,201
Also on his way.

86
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,870
When do we hear from Hawk?

87
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,746
He called this morning.

88
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,207
Now, the county...

89
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,335
...says nobody
by the name of Robertson

90
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,130
had ever lived
next to the Palmers.

91
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,134
We got a current address
on the last occupants.

92
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,471
Kalispell.
We'll check it by afternoon.

93
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,100
- Hey. Watch it, Andy.
- Sorry, Bob.

94
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,102
Oh, my God.

95
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,111
Andy, don't move.

96
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,532
- Where did you get those?
- Don't make me say

97
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,117
where these came from.

98
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,911
Andy?

99
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,875
Please, Agent Cooper,
this is extremely personal business.

100
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,211
Your boots?

101
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,255
Oh, I'm sorry.

102
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:31,843
I bought these from Phillip Gerard
yesterday when he was waiting. Sorry.

103
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,225
These are the same brand of boots
we found at Leo Johnson's.

104
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,603
The Giant said
there was a clue out there.

105
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,146
I thought it was the cocaine?

106
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,107
Harry, we've gotta find Phillip Gerard,
the one-armed man.

107
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,860
Can I go now, Agent Cooper?

108
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,071
I don't know how much time I've got.

109
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,739
If you must.

110
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,539
Harry, what's with Lucy?

111
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,101
- Mr. Horne.
- Walk and talk.

112
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,645
This friend of mine works
with the Seattle Post-Dispatch.

113
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,940
Actually, my sister went to college
with her but she's a friend of mine too.

114
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:31,236
Anyway, she called me this morning
with a hot tip. Top secret.

115
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,447
M.T. Wentz is coming
to Twin Peaks.

116
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,866
M.T. Wentz. M.T. Wentz.

117
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,828
M.T. Wentz, the travel writer.

118
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,705
Yes, M.T. Wentz the travel writer.

119
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:45,542
Wentz travels incognito,
uses only cash, no credit cards.

120
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,085
Nobody can trace his identity.

121
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,423
Or hers. No one at the paper
even knows who he or she is.

122
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,050
Favorable Wentz review
could be quite useful.

123
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,219
Well, he's coming.
He's coming, he's coming.

124
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,139
Keep an eye on the registration.
I want an hourly update.

125
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,767
- Scrutinize every check.
- Especially if they pay cash.

126
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:07,022
Not even 9:30 and you have
already done a good day's work.

127
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:11,234
Oh. Ha-ha. Whoo.

128
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,161
Mr. Horne.

129
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,288
You look well.

130
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,209
- What can I do for you?
- Oh, we've met.

131
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,670
I sell insurance
to the small business.

132
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,547
Like One-Eyed Jack.

133
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,468
Jean Renault.

134
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,429
What's the occasion?

135
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,973
Are my premiums
about to be raised?

136
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,185
No, no. Nothing like that.

137
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,564
Please.

138
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,921
You bastard.

139
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,133
- You bastard!
- Make no mistake, Mr. Horne.

140
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,010
I'm just the messenger.

141
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,929
From whom?

142
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:26,101
They request a large sum of money.

143
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,191
- How much?
- I require something else entirely.

144
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,694
They should bear the cost
of their own middleman.

145
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,362
Ah.

146
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,490
Number one.

147
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,742
Your business up there

148
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,412
is being run
by pickpockets and fools.

149
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,831
A dollar earned is a dollar stolen.

150
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,041
Are you aware of that?

151
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,876
I have my suspicions.

152
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,295
What you need is a partner.

153
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,425
Someone who can take care
of these little problems.

154
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,344
- I have a partner.
- Okay.

155
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,848
Do you want my help or no?

156
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,687
Yes.

157
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,148
One more thing.

158
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,655
I want this man
to bring to me the ransom.

159
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,992
This man is an FBI agent.

160
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,411
Do you want your daughter back?

161
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,246
Of course, I want my daughter back

162
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,831
- but I can't...
- Shh.

163
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,459
Cash...

164
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,335
...partner...

165
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,047
...FBI man.

166
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,010
This is supposed to be
an equitable exchange.

167
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,512
This could turn out well.

168
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,222
Huh?

169
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,395
Expect a call tomorrow...

170
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,272
...noon.

171
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,670
Janet. Ahem.

172
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,174
Find Agent Cooper for me.
It's urgent.

173
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,138
You're kidding?

174
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,390
What's he look like?

175
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,684
Well, you're looking
real pretty today, Donna.

176
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,937
- Thanks.
- Special occasion?

177
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,857
Yeah. I'm having lunch today
with someone I met on my route.

178
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,194
Bedpans and shut-ins.
Who's to meet?

179
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,488
You wouldn't understand.

180
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,992
- Don't spill the soup.
- Thanks, Louie.

181
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,245
Hey, listen to this.

182
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,455
I just got a call from Louie
at the Northern.

183
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,666
M.T. Wentz is coming
to Twin Peaks.

184
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,209
Empty who?

185
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,087
Hank, he's the most powerful
restaurant critic in the state.

186
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,505
- Really?
- Yeah.

187
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,590
And a good review
from him and his Seattle paper

188
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,384
could give us a lot of business.

189
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,220
So she's gonna try to
send him our way.

190
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,683
What's he look like?

191
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,602
Well, nobody knows.
I guess it's a secret.

192
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,855
But he's supposed to be
arriving today.

193
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,023
Then we still got time.

194
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:28,783
Time for what, Hank?

195
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,204
I'm gonna pick up some flowers

196
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,207
and maybe some candles
and some tablecloths.

197
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:40,461
And what can we add to the menu?
Some specials maybe.

198
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,589
I always wanted to try
some regional dishes.

199
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,383
Mm! Babe, we're gonna
trick this place out

200
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,218
like Christmas on the Fourth of July.

201
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,555
Oh, and I think
you should give Big Ed a call.

202
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,058
- Why?
- Well...

203
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,977
...you're still friendly, right?

204
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,479
So maybe this Wentz guy
stops in for gas.

205
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,983
Ed could suggest the Double R
to any new faces he sees.

206
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,611
- I'll call him.
- Good.

207
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,487
You do that.

208
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,255
So...

209
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,258
...what shall we drink to?

210
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:33,014
To Laura.

211
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,935
In our hearts and memories, locked.

212
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,698
Her diary.

213
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,242
Did I tell you I had it?

214
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,995
- Laura's diary?
- Mm-hm.

215
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,832
Shall I read something from it?

216
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,918
It seems appropriate.

217
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,753
- Please.
- Mm.

218
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,927
Ah.

219
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:18,142
"But still I'm afraid to tell her
of my fantasies and my nightmares.

220
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,561
Sometimes she's good
at understanding.

221
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,439
Other times she just giggles
and I don't have the nerve to ask

222
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,734
why things like that
are funny to her.

223
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:32,156
So I feel badly again
and shut up about it for a long time.

224
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,658
I love Donna very mu...

225
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:39,747
But sometimes I worry that
she wouldn't be around me at all

226
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,167
if she knew what my insides
were like.

227
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:48,923
Black and dark
and soaked with dreams of...

228
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,261
...big, big men and different ways
that they might hold me

229
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,973
and take me into their control."

230
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,436
I'm sorry.

231
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,980
No, don't be.

232
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,899
I... I was just, I mean...

233
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,862
I mean, if that's evidence,
shouldn't we give that to the sheriff?

234
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,573
No.

235
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,658
I mean...

236
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,078
I've... I've read this
from cover to cover, Donna,

237
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,373
and there are no solutions here.

238
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,542
Besides...

239
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,712
...she gave it to me.

240
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,839
Why?

241
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:35,094
People come to me
and tell me their stories

242
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,264
about the world outside.

243
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:43,311
I take their stories
and place them

244
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,022
in a larger context.

245
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,608
A sort of living novel.

246
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,318
Who tells you?

247
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,820
Oh, friends.

248
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,282
Lovers.

249
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,664
Well, maybe, someday, you will too.

250
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,424
You were right.

251
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,886
Her kidnappers contacted me
this morning.

252
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,597
Damn me, but you were right.

253
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,600
Why didn't you alert the sheriff?

254
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,104
They'll kill her at first sign of police
involvement. That's why I called you.

255
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,564
That's no reason to circumvent
normal channels.

256
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:33,736
Normal channels won't bring
my daughter back to me alive.

257
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,074
You and Audrey...

258
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,788
You have a special relationship.

259
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,332
You, of all people,

260
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,252
understand her value to me.

261
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,715
They wanna make
the exchange tomorrow.

262
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,468
Audrey...

263
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,680
...for $125,000.

264
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,682
Cash.

265
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,561
But I must ask you.

266
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,066
Will you take it there?

267
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,911
Josie.

268
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,080
Oh, Pete.

269
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,833
So sorry.

270
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,378
Yeah, me too.

271
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,840
You know, I...

272
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,384
...keep thinking about Andrew.

273
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,304
What he would have done
about the fire.

274
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,892
Thank goodness Catherine was here
to handle everything.

275
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,229
What is it?

276
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,232
Josie,

277
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,028
Catherine died in the fire.

278
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,614
God, no.

279
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:05,161
Oh, Pete.

280
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,251
We're...

281
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,463
We're planning a service...

282
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,300
...but they haven't found the body.

283
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,052
Oh, Pete.

284
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,472
In a couple of days we'll go ahead.

285
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:30,603
I don't know exactly
what we'll be burying.

286
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:43,532
Right this way. Come on,
dreamboat. Daddy's waiting.

287
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,077
Come on.

288
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:51,123
Miss Horne was a very bad girl,
refusing to take her medicine.

289
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,710
- Please.
- Weren't you, Miss Horne?

290
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,879
Audrey?

291
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,590
Audrey,

292
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,176
have you been mistreated?

293
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,557
- He hit me.
- Ah.

294
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,352
I did not hit her.

295
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,105
If that's what you're thinking, I didn't.

296
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,190
That was wrong.

297
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:21,028
It will never happen again
as long as you're with me.

298
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,114
Do you understand?

299
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,995
I spoke with your father
this morning.

300
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,330
You're in no danger.

301
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,167
Everything going to be fine.

302
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,169
You do trust me.

303
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,921
Don't you, Audrey?

304
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,757
You see, Audrey,

305
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,176
in a situation like this,

306
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:48,556
you have to handle yourself
in a professional manner.

307
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:52,768
We're all reasonable people
and what you discover

308
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,355
is that something reasonable
can always be worked out

309
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,984
whenever reasonable people
just put their minds...

310
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,452
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

311
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,120
No.

312
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,398
Lucy?

313
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,526
Lucy, we need to talk.

314
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,655
Deputy Brennan,

315
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:50,201
I thought you preferred
the company of your magazine?

316
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,373
Andy?

317
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,917
Maybe you'd better get some air.

318
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,091
Lucy,

319
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,219
I think we're at the point where
it would be healthier for everyone

320
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,056
if you got whatever was
bothering you out in the open.

321
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,479
Andy and I used to go out.

322
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,815
That much I gathered.

323
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,986
For a year and a half until I started
to notice things about him.

324
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,991
They weren't big things,
they were little things.

325
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,123
He never exercises.

326
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:41,669
He never washes his car
and he doesn't even own a sports coat.

327
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,296
Uh-huh. Well, did you do
something about this?

328
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:49,343
Well, after I watched this TV show,
I decided I needed some me time

329
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,554
during which
we didn't see each other.

330
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,599
During which period
I met Dick Tremayne.

331
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:01,605
Horne's Department Store,
Men's Fashions.

332
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:06,068
He had lots of coats and keeps himself
and his car in great shape.

333
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:14,160
Most of his behavior was asinine,

334
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,163
but at least he was different.

335
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,916
Are you still seeing this Dick?

336
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,672
No.

337
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,843
Lucy, do you wanna get
back together with Andy?

338
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,141
I don't know.

339
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,644
Well, Lucy, can you tell me exactly
what you do want?

340
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,899
I don't know.

341
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,698
Sorry, Harry, I was trying to help.

342
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,742
Well, it was a good thought.

343
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:59,413
But it's like trying to fix
those potholes over on Highway 9.

344
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,749
First heavy rain and pfft.

345
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,960
You've been down this road before?

346
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,129
Sure have.

347
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,925
Harry.

348
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,262
I've got a dangerous situation.

349
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,182
I've examined every possible angle

350
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,227
and I believe
there's only one way to proceed.

351
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,522
I need a favor, strictly between us.

352
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,273
What's up?

353
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,611
I need one of the Bookhouse Boys.
Your best man.

354
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,114
It would be better
if you didn't know why.

355
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,619
Cooper, I've steered clear
when you asked me to.

356
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,622
Is there anything I need to know
about this one?

357
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,958
Absolutely not.

358
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,126
I'll set it up.

359
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,587
Nine-thirty at the Roadhouse.

360
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,464
Thanks, Harry.

361
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,954
- It must be him.
- Here we go.

362
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,208
Good evening, sir,
welcome to the Double R Diner.

363
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,043
Thanks, could I have a booth?

364
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,462
Of course, right this way.

365
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,598
We have two very delicious
specials this evening...

366
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:44,435
I'm sure you do but I'll have
a cheeseburger, medium,

367
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,438
a Coke and some fries.

368
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,815
Very good.

369
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,528
Excuse me, Toad?

370
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,197
Why don't we finish this up
in the kitchen?

371
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,158
- Mm. Mm-mm.
- There you go.

372
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,952
Get in the back
and don't touch anything.

373
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,662
He only wanted a cheeseburger.

374
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,873
It must be some kind of
food-critic trick.

375
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,875
- You think so?
- Absolutely, yeah. I think...

376
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,251
[CUSTOMER CLEARS THROAT]

377
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,134
Bathroom?

378
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,428
Oh, right this way, sir.

379
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,140
We just finished painting it
and it looks really nice.

380
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,434
It's completely private.
Yeah, follow me.

381
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,102
Oh, sorry.

382
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,938
- Good stuff.
- Toad!

383
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,941
- Toad, get out of my...
- Mm. Whoops.

384
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,675
Thanks for coming.

385
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:02,096
- I didn't know...
- Know what?

386
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,599
I didn't know if you were mad or not.

387
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,102
I mean, how mad.

388
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,771
I'll survive.

389
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,234
Donna, there's nothing going on
between me and James.

390
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,568
What if there is? I mean,

391
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,530
who said James and I
couldn't see other people?

392
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,907
I certainly didn't.

393
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,870
Are you saying you're seeing
someone else?

394
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,292
Maddy, I need your help.

395
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:39,258
- How?
- Harold Smith has Laura's diary.

396
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,928
I thought the sheriff
had Laura's diary.

397
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,307
Harold said that Laura kept
a second diary that I didn't know about

398
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,976
and he's got it.

399
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,728
God.

400
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,815
We have to tell James about this.

401
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,486
If Laura did have a secret diary...

402
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,114
...and Harold's got it...

403
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,243
...I'm gonna get it
with or without you.

404
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,331
Tell that to James.

405
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,243
I know I paid too much for it,

406
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:51,038
but I just fell in love with it.

407
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,708
I heard the salesperson say,

408
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,919
"The only reason
we're still in business

409
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,130
is because Josie Packard
buys retail."

410
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,927
I like it.

411
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,054
- You do?
- I like it, yeah.

412
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,018
- You're so cold.
- Josie.

413
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,522
Josie, I gotta know.
Were you really in Seattle?

414
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,359
Yes, why are you so suspicious?

415
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,903
Look at these boxes.

416
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,322
You think I got them
at Cash and Carry?

417
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,533
Why didn't you tell me
you were going?

418
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,327
You know I had to get away,
I was afraid.

419
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,664
- I know, afraid of Ben and Catherine.
- You know that.

420
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,124
And now Catherine's dead.

421
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,753
Harry?

422
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,881
- You don't think I...
- I don't know what to think.

423
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,051
- I don't know.
- You think I could burn the mill?

424
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,012
That I would ruin
everything of mine?

425
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,974
There's insurance money.

426
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,185
My God.

427
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,730
How could you?

428
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:03,527
How could you think
of such terrible things?

429
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,530
How could you hurt me so?

430
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,881
I was just so worried.

431
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,051
I'm sorry.

432
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,681
Hold me.

433
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,059
- Take me.
- Josie.

434
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,520
- I want you to take me.
- Josie.

435
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,858
Josie, why?
Why didn't you tell me?

436
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,868
Tear it.

437
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,828
What?

438
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,747
Tear it.

439
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,471
I want you.

440
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,767
I need you.

441
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,109
I want you

442
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,278
more than my own life.

443
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,023
Hi, good-looking.

444
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,819
Who do you have to grease
to get some coffee around here?

445
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:12,280
Judge Sternwood.
Hello, Your Honor.

446
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,659
Lucy, you're a cool drink of water

447
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,078
to road-weary eyes.

448
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,538
What's your secret?

449
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:24,126
I'd rather not talk about it, sir.

450
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,629
Give us a hug?

451
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:35,804
Ah. Life is hard, dear.

452
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,015
Still and all, it's...

453
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,226
It's harder in most places
than in Twin Peaks.

454
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,562
Clinton.

455
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,814
Sorry I'm late.

456
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,316
Oh, I only just arrived.

457
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,902
Good to see you.

458
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,614
What's her name, Harry?

459
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,993
- What?
- You got the look of a man

460
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,703
with filly trouble, son.

461
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:04,875
If they don't take the saddle,
you got two options.

462
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,502
- And I won't bore you with either one.
- Harry?

463
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,381
Judge Sternwood,
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

464
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,966
FBI.

465
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,011
- How are you, lad?
- Your Honor.

466
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,722
You two should have
a lot in common.

467
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,933
Sid will bring in the court calendar
as soon as the Winnebago

468
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,560
is tanked up.

469
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,563
You wanna break the seal
on that Irish you stashed for me?

470
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,774
Right this way.

471
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:34,196
Mr. Cooper, how do you find
our little corner of this world?

472
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,281
Heaven, sir.

473
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,409
Well, this week, heaven includes

474
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,455
arson, multiple homicides

475
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,833
and an attempt on the life
of a federal agent.

476
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:50,087
Heaven is a large
and interesting place, sir.

477
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,051
Lucy?

478
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,471
Dick.

479
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,640
Lucy, I haven't slept.

480
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,767
I can't eat.

481
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,270
I've been absolutely miserable.

482
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,524
You have?

483
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,361
I've been a fool, a cad,
the way I've behaved and I'm...

484
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,989
I'm deeply, deeply ashamed.

485
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,118
You are?

486
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,120
I've been over it in my mind
a million times

487
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,372
and what I've come to is this.

488
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,999
I have to...

489
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,253
No, I must do the right thing.

490
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,006
You must?

491
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,677
It's...

492
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,179
It's everything I could
scrape together.

493
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,890
I'm completely knackered.

494
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,482
What is this?

495
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:56,153
Six hundred and fifty dollars.

496
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,696
I've called around.

497
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,490
I've been told
it's more than adequate.

498
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,244
For what?

499
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,955
For the...

500
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,957
To take care of...

501
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,209
You know...

502
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,753
...the little problem.

503
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,590
Richard,

504
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,551
here's what you're going to do:

505
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,345
Take your money,

506
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:26,308
put it back in your wallet
or your pocket,

507
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,728
turn around and walk through
both sets of doors...

508
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,022
The second one sticks sometimes.

509
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:36,985
- Go out into the parking lot,
get in your car, turn the key,

510
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,864
and never, ever speak to me again

511
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,325
as long as you live!

512
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:47,078
Say one more word and I'll scream.

513
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,914
Leave, please.

514
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,264
Dick!

515
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,395
Dick.

516
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,031
Leland...

517
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,285
...this is most difficult.

518
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,788
My deepest condolences

519
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,124
on your heartbreaking loss.

520
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,419
Thank you, sir.

521
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:41,091
You've appeared before me
many times.

522
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,303
I know you to be a fine,
decent man

523
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,847
and a capable attorney.

524
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,726
And to see you under
these circumstances is...

525
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,604
Is dreadful for us all.

526
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,315
Now, the law provides a structure

527
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,902
to guide us through
perilous and trying times.

528
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:07,784
But it requires our submission
to its procedures and higher purposes.

529
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:13,957
Before we assume our respective roles
in this enduring drama...

530
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,502
...just let me say that

531
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:22,757
when these frail shadows
we inhabit now

532
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,760
have quit the stage,

533
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,471
we'll meet

534
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,642
and raise a glass again together

535
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,769
in Valhalla.

536
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,402
Would that it were so.

537
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:47,907
I understand it's your intention
to represent yourself.

538
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,618
Correct.

539
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,914
Well, where's Lodwick,
the prosecutor?

540
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,916
- Overdue.
- Well, I suggest

541
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,044
we leave the question of bail
till morning.

542
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,340
The facilities are adequate, Leland?

543
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,841
Oh, yes.

544
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,219
Everyone has been most kind.

545
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,305
Then we'll say good night.

546
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,849
- Deputy.
- Good night.

547
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,729
Thank you.

548
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,323
I'll speak for us all.

549
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,410
We have hard jobs.

550
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,626
We're ready to roll.

551
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,339
Well, hi, Sid.

552
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,216
Harry.

553
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,219
Sid, say hello
to Special Agent Cooper.

554
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,138
- Agent Cooper.
- How do you do?

555
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,349
Well, gentlemen,

556
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,436
we've been eight hours
on the road.

557
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:02,524
Sid and I are gonna pile it over
to The Great Northern,

558
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,569
hook up the Winne
and dine in the Timber Room.

559
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,531
See you in court.

560
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,663
Wife?

561
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:20,125
Uhn-uhn. Law clerk.

562
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,253
Man, oh, man.

563
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:29,300
Harry, is everything set for tonight?

564
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,303
- He'll be there.
- Okay.

565
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,481
Is this your friend Katrina?

566
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,359
Katrina? Katrina.

567
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,821
And this is Miss...

568
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,451
Come along, girls.

569
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,703
All right, Mr. Tojamura. We're all set.

570
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,206
Now, what credit card
do you wanna put that on?

571
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,417
- Cash, please.
- Cash?

572
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,419
Fine.

573
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,464
Where did you say
you traveled from, sir?

574
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,592
- Seattle.
- Seattle?

575
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:56,012
Oh, that's not such a long trip, then.
Ha-ha.

576
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,224
Very good, Mr. Tojamura.

577
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,809
The bellman will take you
up to your suite.

578
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,603
And if you would like to treat yourself

579
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,065
to some of our outstanding
local cuisine while you're here,

580
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,693
I would recommend
the Double R Diner.

581
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,029
Ask for Norma.

582
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,990
Thank you very much.

583
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,084
Norma, it's Louie.

584
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,879
I think the eagle has landed.

585
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,300
Pete, meet my cousin Jonathan.

586
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,885
Jonathan.

587
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:39,097
You thinking cousin have some joe?

588
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,850
After a long flight it will help him
reset his biographical clock.

589
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,437
Mm-hm. That's "biological."

590
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,815
I think so, I just made a fresh pot.

591
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,526
Here. Cup of joe coming up.

592
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,529
- Biological.
- Biological.

593
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,909
Don't know how you lasted six years.

594
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,161
Nothing but hayseeds
and manual laborers.

595
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,414
Well, we all got our job to do.

596
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,583
Yours is nearly finished.

597
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,794
The sale of the mill
and the Packard lands?

598
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,589
Signing the contracts soon.
I need Pete's signature.

599
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,091
- He's Catherine's heir.
- Will that be difficult?

600
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,260
- No.
- How long?

601
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,805
- Two days.
- We're expected back in Hong Kong.

602
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,142
Mr. Eckhardt wants very much
to see you.

603
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:28,438
Are there any other complications?

604
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,941
There might be a problem with Hank.

605
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,902
I'll deal with him.

606
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,615
- Are we suspected?
- Certainly not.

607
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,867
What about this sheriff?

608
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,452
He means nothing to me.

609
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,495
That's not what I asked you.

610
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:58,426
Nine-thirty, right on the tick.

611
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,054
Is he here?

612
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,056
He's here.

613
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,609
Are we in any particular hurry?

614
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,277
Harry,

615
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,364
let me buy you a beer. Bartender?

616
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,786
All right, I'm coming!

617
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,621
All right!

618
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,000
Hey, we're not op...

619
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,508
Oh, fart.

620
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,441
What's the deal?

621
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,155
Huh?

622
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,369
Do I know you?

623
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,712
Okay.

624
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,279
Listen, I think I'm just gonna
lay here for a while.

625
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,575
What?

626
00:45:55,043 --> 00:46:00,047
Blood brother,
next time I take your head off.
