1
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:08,341
Here is, uh... Here's my résumé.

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,844
I mean, technically it says
"curriculum vitae,"

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:16,015
which I think is more
professional, but, you know,

4
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,725
same thing, pretty much.

5
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,727
That's... Wow, great.

6
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,897
This position truly is a
no-experience-necessary kind of thing.

7
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,317
Well, and it doesn't
really say it here,

8
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:30,405
but I have a solid
background in sales.

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,532
I'm pretty much a self-starter, so...

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,909
That's excellent, but...
Excellent.

11
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:39,205
I just... I really feel I could
be a major,

12
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,500
major asset to your sales force.

13
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,669
Ah.

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,422
I'm thinking there's
a little misunderstanding.

15
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,298
This isn't actually
a sales job.

16
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,219
I mean, I'd be happy to consider
you for a sales position,

17
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,471
but all our agents
need to be licensed,

18
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,099
have at least two years
on-the-job experience

19
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,851
and usually
a college degree.

20
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,602
Oh.

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,691
What you'll be doing
is more like

22
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,735
advertising.

23
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,249
Hey, Jesse.

24
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,585
Hey, man.

25
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:26,919
Yo, man.

26
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,005
What up?
Badger?

27
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,674
Where you been
keeping yourself?

28
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,343
Nice duds.

29
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,262
Yeah,
you too.

30
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,139
Thanks.

31
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,184
Yo, why would you wanna
do this lame-ass job, anyway?

32
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,186
I mean, no offense.

33
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,854
Because I'm on
probation, yo.

34
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,399
I gotta prove to the man
I'm rehabilitated.

35
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,652
Upstanding citizen,
all that shit.

36
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,614
It's really good
exercise too. Look.

37
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,450
You can't just stand there,
you have to spin the arrow.

38
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,912
There's all these moves you have
to learn, like "the helicopter."

39
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:04,916
Wow.

40
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,335
Yeah. See, yeah?

41
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,878
That one's a bitch.

42
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,713
I'm not very good
at it yet.

43
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,132
Well, you really opened
my eyes to the possibilities.

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,593
Yeah.
Hey, anyways,

45
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,013
thanks for the toke.
Any time.

46
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,389
Speaking of which,

47
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,894
you think you could maybe
hook me up with some crystal?

48
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,439
Ah, no, I've been out of
the business for a while.

49
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,900
Actually, now thinking
about retiring.

50
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,110
What? No.
Yeah.

51
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,696
That stuff you made
is unbelievable.

52
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,281
It was pretty awesome.

53
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,658
Retirement?

54
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,160
Ah! I can't be hearing this.

55
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:45,414
No, man, I had this partner
who was helping me cook.

56
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,000
I mean, I was doing
most of the work...

57
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,255
but he was an asshole, so...

58
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,675
Anyway, I mean, pseudo's getting
harder and harder to come by and...

59
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,594
Yo, I can hook you up
with some pseudo.

60
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,513
Major pseudo.

61
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,099
I got channels, bro.

62
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,767
We could partner up.

63
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,477
Huh?

64
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,104
No pressure.

65
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,690
No pressure. Just think
about it, all right?

66
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,442
Oh, shit. I gotta go.

67
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,454
Yo, this way to savings.

68
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,790
Save your dollar bills, y'all.

69
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,132
♪ This way to savings
This way to savings ♪

70
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,554
Come on!
Save some money.

71
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,205
It's a stupid gift.

72
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,999
No, it isn't. He'll love it.

73
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,834
I don't know
what I was thinking.

74
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,004
Didn't the invitation
even say "no gifts"?

75
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,881
Walt.
What?

76
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,674
We have to go.

77
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,801
I know, I'm not complaining.

78
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,178
Yes, you are.

79
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,849
Look, we need this.

80
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,227
We've been through
a lot lately. Okay?

81
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:36,525
Jesus, guess we
didn't get the "beige" memo.

82
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,819
Ah, we're okay.

83
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,323
Yes, I look like I'm wearing
a prom dress from 1985.

84
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,158
Honey, you look fine.

85
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,745
Walt, this is the only thing
I could find that fit me.

86
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,708
God, would you look at that.
The invitation said "no gifts."

87
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,252
So? Come on.

88
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,756
Sir, I'll take that
for you.

89
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,177
Thank you.
You're welcome.

90
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,889
Ahem. Oh, look,
there's Elliott.

91
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,684
Oh, come on,
let's go say hello.

92
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,561
Elliott. Ha.

93
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,356
Walt. You made it.

94
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,068
Happy birthday.
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

95
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,695
Thank you. Skyler.

96
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,781
Hi. Oh. Oh, that's right.

97
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,367
Great to see you. You look
beautiful, as always.

98
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,745
Oh. Well, these days a little
more big than beautiful, but...

99
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,416
Of course, congratulations.
That was such great news.

100
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,253
Thank you.
Gretchen, look who's here.

101
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,756
- Oh.
- Oh.

102
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,383
Oh, it's been ages.

103
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,386
Oh, it's so good to see you.

104
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,222
Oh, it's really good.
Heh-heh.

105
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,974
Skyler, welcome.
Congratulations.

106
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,476
Thank you.
It's really nice to be here.

107
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,438
- When are you due?
- In about 10 more weeks.

108
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,483
And actually, we recently
found out that it's a girl.

109
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,403
Oh, that's so wonderful.
Yeah.

110
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,072
Yeah, we've been thinking
about it for ourselves.

111
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,490
Yeah, thinking about it.

112
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,662
Uh, oh, hey, by the way,

113
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,790
securing that patent
was just amazing.

114
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,585
I mean, the work that
your company is doing...

115
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,796
Congratulations
to both of you.

116
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,675
Hard work and a lot of luck. A lot.
Yeah. Oh, well, now.

117
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:25,968
Elliott.

118
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,970
Uh, will you excuse us?
We gotta say hi.

119
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,014
Make yourselves at home,
we'll catch up later.

120
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,515
Sure, sure. Okay.

121
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,142
Okay.
So glad you're here.

122
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,810
Thank you.
Bye.

123
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,687
John, Missy. How are you?

124
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,481
Shall we?

125
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,193
Congratulations.
Happy birthday.

126
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,827
Oh.

127
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,788
Wow.

128
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,977
Hm. Hm.

129
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,018
Walt?

130
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,728
I thought
that was you.

131
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,023
Farley.
Long time no see.

132
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,234
This is Walter White.
Oh. Hello.

133
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,069
Back at Caltech,
he was...

134
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,738
You were just a master
of crystallography.

135
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:10,906
I remember
this one time

136
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:16,120
we were stuck on this
protein problem for weeks.

137
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,622
You just breezed
right in,

138
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,583
and you had
one word for us...

139
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,876
Synchrotrons.
Mm.

140
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,627
It was synchrotrons,
yeah.

141
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:24,920
They generate pure

142
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,423
and more complete
patterns than x-ray beams.

143
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,718
Data collection takes
a fraction of the time.

144
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,262
This is the White
in Gray Matter.

145
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,140
Tell them, Walt.

146
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,641
Okay.

147
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,061
Well, back when Elliott and I
were in grad school,

148
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,813
we came up with
the name. Ahem.

149
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,066
Schwartz, black.
Walter White.

150
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,153
So together they became
Gray Matter Technologies.

151
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,947
Cute, huh?
So you run the company with Elliott?

152
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,909
No. No, that's
Gretchen and Elliott.

153
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,287
Yeah, yeah. You know,
I gravitated toward education.

154
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,623
Ah. What university?

155
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,962
Oh, wow,
it's a Stratocaster.

156
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,256
Not just any Strat.

157
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,799
That's one of Clapton's.

158
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:11,967
No way.

159
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:17,640
"To Elliott, sorry about the
buckle rash, Eric Clapton."

160
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,601
Thank you.
This is beautiful.

161
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,645
- Why is he doing this?
- Beautiful.

162
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,647
What is he, like 8 years old?

163
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,607
Here, honey.

164
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,153
Thanks.

165
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,488
Oh, this is from Walt.

166
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,323
Oh, God.
It's okay.

167
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,618
Hey.

168
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,371
Let's see what we got.

169
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,003
Yum Good Ramen.

170
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:04,228
This is what Walt
and I lived on

171
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,855
for, uh, 10 months straight

172
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,858
while we were working
on our thesis.

173
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,987
Sold them down at Ralstow's
in the hardware aisle.

174
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,989
Right next to the...
What was it?

175
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,324
- Sterno. Yeah.
- The Sterno.

176
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,535
Yeah, 10 for
a dollar ninety-nine.

177
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,705
To this day, I am convinced
these noodles

178
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,040
were responsible
for our success.

179
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,376
This was our lifeblood.

180
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:31,088
Man, where'd you find these? I thought
they'd been outlawed years ago.

181
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,883
I love it.

182
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,512
Thank you, Walt.

183
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,848
Well...

184
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,933
For the man
who has everything.

185
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,352
- No, no, no.
- It was.

186
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,687
No, you remember the fat guy.

187
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,189
Yes.
We used to call him Snot Trough.

188
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,941
He had that thing
under his nose.

189
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,694
What do you call that thing?
That was Dobkins.

190
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,738
That was the same guy who always
smelled like chocolate milk.

191
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,741
It was.
No, no, no.

192
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,243
It wasn't Dobkins,
it was...

193
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,913
Anyway, I swear to Christ,
he used to iron those patches

194
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,417
onto the elbows of his
Members Only jacket

195
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,086
because he thought it made him
look more distinguished.

196
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,880
Didn't it? I thought it...
No.

197
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,925
Oh, God.
Well, here's to Snot Trough.

198
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,886
To Snot Trough.
Wherever you may be.

199
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,721
God bless him.

200
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:27,394
And you remember the professor who
used to hate Robert Wilhelm Bunsen?

201
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,606
Yes. All you had to do was
mention the Bunsen burner

202
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,816
and he was off on a rant.

203
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,111
"Oh, he didn't invent it."
Do you remember the waving?

204
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,073
"He just improved it,"
you know.

205
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,908
It was easy to kill
15 minutes.

206
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,576
Yeah.

207
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:47,331
Oh, God.
I miss this, Walt.

208
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,125
Yeah. Me too.

209
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,461
Listen, we ought to get
together more often.

210
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,924
Skyler and I would love to have you and
Gretchen over for dinner sometime.

211
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,967
Oh, sure, yeah,
absolutely.

212
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:04,973
But, you know, what I mean is that you
and I should work together again.

213
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,978
Are you gonna teach high school?
No, no, no, seriously.

214
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,481
What's stopping us?

215
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,694
Wait a minute, Elliott,
what are you...?

216
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,656
Are you asking me to come
work for you at Gray Matter?

217
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,825
Yeah, why not?
You'd fit right in.

218
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,328
You're brilliant,
you got a ton of experience.

219
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,122
Well, I...

220
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,708
I wouldn't really know
where to begin. I mean...

221
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,002
God, you have no idea.

222
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,173
I spend my days just drawing
out atoms on the chalkboard

223
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,218
and trying to get these kids
to learn the periodic table.

224
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,303
Look, I understand.

225
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,015
You're a little rusty, but you're
not seeing the upside here.

226
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,894
We could really benefit
from a new set of eyes.

227
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,856
You know what it's like when you've
been trying to crack some problem

228
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,066
for months on end,
you get tunnel vision.

229
00:12:56,234 --> 00:13:01,155
One guy thinking outside of the box,
you may be exactly what we need.

230
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,840
Well, listen, Elliott, it...

231
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,343
The offer is very appealing,
it really is, I thank you.

232
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,889
But there's...

233
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,391
There's something
you should know.

234
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:36,398
I have some personal issues.

235
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,901
Look, there's nothing
we can't work out.

236
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,361
Well, yeah,

237
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,114
but it's complicated.

238
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,533
We can help you.

239
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,411
We have excellent
health insurance.

240
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,749
The best.

241
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,147
Ahem. Um, hey, did you try
those prosciutto-wrapped figs?

242
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,274
They were, like, wow.
They were just...

243
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,944
I must have had about
30 of those suckers.

244
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,154
Oh, and the seafood table,
did you see that?

245
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,783
They had lobster tail, they
had crab legs, like, shrimp.

246
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,535
They had...

247
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,624
Walt.
What the hell did you say to Elliott?

248
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,668
What?
You told him about the cancer,

249
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,754
didn't you? Didn't you?

250
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,131
I can't believe it.

251
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,927
Okay, we were talking, he
asked how you were doing,

252
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:52,015
and I am sorry, but I don't have the best
poker face these days where that's concerned.

253
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,852
He knew something was wrong
with you, and he pressed me.

254
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,604
He pressed you? Come on.

255
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,440
Walt, when it came
right down to it,

256
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,985
I didn't know what else to do
but tell him the truth.

257
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,989
The truth? Well, how about
you just said, "He's fine," huh?

258
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,202
You think maybe you could just have said that?
"He's fine." And then it would have been done.

259
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,162
I don't like the way
you're talking to me.

260
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,999
I don't like the way you talk
about my private affairs

261
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:21,169
to people who are not
even in our lives anymore.

262
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,839
Well, what exactly
did he say to you?

263
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,340
He offered me a job.
What?

264
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:29,052
Yes. Kind of like some
fig leaf, you know.

265
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,680
Some face-saving
bullshit

266
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:35,058
that allowed me to generously
accept his charity.

267
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,728
And then when I turned
that down, he flat out

268
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,022
offered to pay
for my treatment.

269
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,317
Which is exactly what you
expected him to do, didn't you?

270
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:44,860
Walt.
Didn't you?

271
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:48,071
No. I did not put him up...
Please. Come on. Come on.

272
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,410
Okay, what did you say?

273
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,247
Walt?

274
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,708
What do you think I said?

275
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,003
Why? Walt.

276
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,428
Hm. Ready to go?

277
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,390
I'm taking the bus.

278
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,894
Okay.

279
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,815
Bye, honey.

280
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,480
Hey, dude.
Are these bullet holes?

281
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,274
Uh...

282
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:50,444
No, man. Those are for,
like, you know,

283
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,654
uh, ventilation.

284
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,781
Cool.

285
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:59,369
Ooh. Nice setup, huh?

286
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,663
Man.
This is nothing, man.

287
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,791
I used to have, like,
twice as much glassware,

288
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,711
until my dumb-ass
ex-partner

289
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:11,173
drove us into a ditch
and wrecked most of it.

290
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,884
Big-ass beaker, huh?

291
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,512
Hey, wait, wait, no, that's...
Yeah, that's a boiling flask.

292
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,806
This is a beaker.

293
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:24,686
Here's a Griffin beaker.
Here's a volumetric beaker.

294
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,689
Here's an Erlenmeyer flask.

295
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:28,982
Um, you got...

296
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,860
Wow. You really
know your shit.

297
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,404
It's just basic chemistry, yo.

298
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,908
So...

299
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,076
you got something for me?

300
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,995
Aw, hells, yeah.

301
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,551
Okay. We're in business.

302
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,761
Right on, Badger.

303
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,305
Dude, check
this out.

304
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,182
Jesus.

305
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,850
What the hell are you
bringing that for?

306
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,852
Hunting.

307
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,355
We might see javelinas.

308
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,970
Are you gonna help me
or what?

309
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,434
Hey.

310
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,108
Badger!

311
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,785
Huh? Huh? Yeah?

312
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,162
Yeah, buddy. Huh? Yeah.

313
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,209
Let's see the money.

314
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,003
Here.

315
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,297
I need five each.
Come on, two more.

316
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,299
Here.

317
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,426
What about him?

318
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,512
Are you kidding?
He looks younger than us.

319
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,014
Whatever.

320
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,516
What about
that guy?

321
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,518
No, he looks like
a businessman.

322
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,728
So what?

323
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,564
So businessmen
are always in a hurry.

324
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:18,026
They're always, like, going
to some meeting or something.

325
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,195
Seriously, he's just
gonna say no.

326
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,074
Hey, hey, this guy.

327
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,534
This is our guy.
You're up.

328
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,536
Huh? Why do I
have to do it?

329
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,705
Give me the crutches
and I'll go do it.

330
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,334
Shit.

331
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,880
Um, excuse me, hey,

332
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,216
we forgot our IDs,
and we were wondering

333
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:45,053
if you could do us a favor
and buy us a six-pack?

334
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,847
You know, what you're
asking is illegal.

335
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,558
Um, no, it's not.

336
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,727
Yeah, it is.

337
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,271
Oh, shit.

338
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,901
Guess you win the jackpot.

339
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,571
This is not how I wanted
to spend my night off.

340
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,908
Consider this your first
and last warning.

341
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,076
Yes, sir.

342
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,078
You're lucky you
got a good dad here.

343
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,255
If the other guys hadn't run,

344
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,258
I could've talked my way out of it.

345
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:25,593
Not cool, man. Not cool.

346
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,264
What, you never tried to buy
beer when you were my age?

347
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,392
No, I'm talking about you
calling me and not your father.

348
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,769
How do you think
that'd make him feel?

349
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,615
I don't even
know what to say to you.

350
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,120
Just go.

351
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,456
I'll deal with you later.

352
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,920
Phew.

353
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,464
Where's Walt?

354
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,594
I haven't seen him since this morning.
Your guess is as good as mine.

355
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,138
Listen, do me a favor,
all right?

356
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,265
Don't tell him about the kid.

357
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,351
He's just a teenager
trying to score some beer.

358
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,812
You know,

359
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:19,814
just growing pains.

360
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,319
I mean, he finds out his dad's sick,
he starts acting out, you know?

361
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:27,197
First the pot,
then this.

362
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,823
The pot?

363
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,828
You told me the kid
was smoking reefer.

364
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,163
That's what Skyler told me.

365
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:39,667
I mean, you may as well have.
I wasn't talking about Walter, Jr.

366
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,670
I was talking about Walt.

367
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,841
Excuse me?

368
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,385
He admitted it.

369
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,847
He said he liked it.

370
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,349
Walt?

371
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,017
Mm-hm.

372
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,022
Shit.

373
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,903
I didn't think
he had it in him.

374
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,571
It's like he's not himself lately.

375
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,532
Yeah.
I mean,

376
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,160
why would anyone in their right
mind choose not to do treatment?

377
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,996
Especially when
it's completely paid for.

378
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,040
Why is he doing this?

379
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,210
You know what
we need to do?

380
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,380
What we really need to do
is sit him down, all of us,

381
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,841
and get everything out
on the table.

382
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,385
Talk it all through.

383
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:33,555
You mean an intervention?
No, no.

384
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,183
Just a family meeting.

385
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:40,520
Where everyone
can voice their concerns

386
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,064
and be heard.

387
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,116
You are a genius, bro.

388
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,285
This cankenstein is unreal.

389
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,620
When we get back, I'm gonna
burn that dollar-bill suit

390
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:01,082
because we're gonna
make some mad dough.

391
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,960
It's not right.

392
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,712
What do you mean,
it's not right?

393
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:11,050
It's cloudy. It's not
supposed to be cloudy.

394
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,928
Okay, that last time,
it was glass.

395
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:19,100
So what? Cloudy, not cloudy?
It looks good enough to me.

396
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,937
Good enough.

397
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:28,109
Wait, wait.
Yo, what are you doing?

398
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,323
Aah!

399
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,242
Are you out of your mind? I
totally would've smoked that.

400
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,578
Look, it's not for you,
it's for our customers.

401
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,663
They're gonna demand
a certain standard.

402
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,791
What? What...? What are you...?

403
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,461
What?
We'll just do it again.

404
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,630
Until we get it right.

405
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,366
Walt.

406
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,787
Please have a seat and join us.

407
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,256
We can do better.

408
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:14,882
No, don't you fucking
think about it.

409
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,885
Hey.
Come on.

410
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,222
Three entire pounds
of pseudo wasted.

411
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,558
Do you know how long
I had to spin that stupid sign?

412
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:26,394
Get off me, psycho.
Helicopter, bitch!

413
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,531
Ah, God!

414
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:43,745
Asshole.

415
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,623
Open the door.

416
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,398
Come back here,
you bitch!

417
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,108
I'm gonna
mess you up!

418
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,737
This isn't funny!

419
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:30,291
I really need to understand
your thought process,

420
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,418
because clearly I don't.

421
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:37,423
I feel that this decision
you've made

422
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,967
is not only
not in your best interest,

423
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:43,596
it's not in the best interest
of our entire family.

424
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:47,100
- Look, Skyler...
- Not yet, please. L...

425
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,977
I have the talking pillow.

426
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,482
Everybody gets to speak
their minds, remember?

427
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,318
And then you'll get
your chance.

428
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,489
Money has always been
an issue for us, I'll give you that.

429
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,826
But now that Elliott is more
than willing to pitch in...

430
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,329
Walt, I know, I understand that
it's hard for you to accept help.

431
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,540
Maybe it's the way
you were raised.

432
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,667
But, honey,

433
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:16,796
it's okay to lean on people
now and again.

434
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,215
You need this treatment.

435
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,343
And nothing can stop you
from getting it,

436
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,178
except you.

437
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:35,231
- Am I allowed to respond?
- In a minute.

438
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:39,360
I think we need to go
around the circle first.

439
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,489
Hank, would you
like to start?

440
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:50,705
Uh, yeah. Okay, well...

441
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:53,207
What I would say is...
Take the talking pillow.

442
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,467
All right, look, buddy, um,

443
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:07,263
I know I don't get to
tell you this enough,

444
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,058
but I care about you.

445
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,853
A hell of a lot.

446
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,355
And this cancer thing...

447
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:21,027
Let's just... Let's face it, you know,
you were dealt a shit hand.

448
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,070
But, um,

449
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,198
sometimes your luck can change.

450
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,409
I mean... I mean, I can't tell
you how many times I was...

451
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,369
You know,
I started with a shit hand

452
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,248
and I ended up with, you know,
a full house. Okay?

453
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,751
I mean, the key is,
you gotta hang in there.

454
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,878
Man, you gotta keep
placing your bets,

455
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,047
keep placing your bets.
Boom.

456
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:45,426
Hank, what the hell
are you saying?

457
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,428
Please, Marie, let him talk.

458
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,765
That's what we're here
to do. Please.

459
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,559
Go on, Hank.

460
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:58,606
All right, look at it
this way, okay?

461
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:03,569
It's the bottom of the ninth,
bases are loaded, you're up.

462
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,447
But you got
a bum arm, right?

463
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,909
There's no fricking way
you're gonna hit a homer, okay?

464
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:13,788
So you can either let
the pinch hitter take the bat,

465
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:17,959
or you can hold on to your
pride and lose the game.

466
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,294
You get what
I'm saying?

467
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,339
No.

468
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,302
You got your pride, man.
I get it, okay? I get it.

469
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,305
But this Daddy Warbucks
wants to chip in, man.

470
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:35,685
I'm with your old lady on this one.
I say take the money and run, man.

471
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:41,148
Somebody wanna
take this thing? Here.

472
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,650
Yes, Walter...

473
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,485
Walter, Jr., I'm sure

474
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:48,656
that you have about a million
things to say, probably.

475
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,325
And now is your chance.

476
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,788
Go ahead. Just let it all out.

477
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,500
This is bullshit.

478
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,502
- Hey, come on.
- It's all right.

479
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,629
It...

480
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,301
Talk.

481
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,012
Tell your dad how you feel.

482
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,684
I'm pissed off.
Tell him.

483
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:20,062
I'm pissed off.

484
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,857
Because you're being...

485
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,859
You're...

486
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,529
You're a pussy.

487
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,868
You're, like,
ready to give up.

488
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,665
You're... God.

489
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,335
What if you gave up
on me, huh?

490
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,092
This here,

491
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,345
all the stuff
I've been through,

492
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:56,849
and you're scared
of a little chemotherapy?

493
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,949
Me, personally,

494
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,537
I think you should do
whatever you wanna do.

495
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,957
What?

496
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,211
You told us to be honest
about our feelings.

497
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,546
Walt's the one with cancer,
it's his decision.

498
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,715
It's not up to any of us.

499
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:34,387
Why in hell would you do this?
Hey, hey.

500
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,723
I wasn't planning
on agreeing with Walt.

501
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:42,269
But after sitting here and listening to you all
talk about his future like he has no say in it...

502
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:46,440
He's not gonna have a future
if he doesn't get treatment.

503
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,610
I am a medical professional.

504
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:53,781
I x-ray people in treatment
every day.

505
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,450
I see them every day.
And you know what?

506
00:33:56,618 --> 00:34:00,454
Some of them
are absolutely miserable.

507
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,290
Marie...
I'm sorry, but it's true.

508
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,126
And some of them
don't wanna

509
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,129
spend their last weeks
or months

510
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,798
being picked at by doctors.

511
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,426
But they got talked into it
by their families.

512
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,761
Can I get the pillow back?
I agree with Marie on this one.

513
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:16,971
- Thank you.
- Hank...

514
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,306
What? Maybe Walt wants
to die like a man, all right?

515
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,976
I don't want him to die at all.

516
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:25,438
That's the whole point of this.
So either help or leave.

517
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,691
Skyler, I just wanted
to do you the courtesy

518
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,152
of giving you
my honest opinion.

519
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,989
You know, Marie,
this is not debate club.

520
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,032
This is my husband's life
we're talking about here.

521
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,536
You know, I made one
simple observation...

522
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,372
And it's like you...
How dare you...

523
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,166
Okay, so we disagree...
Ladies! Marie!

524
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,255
This is so stupid.

525
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,845
All right, I've got
the talking pillow now.

526
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,514
Okay?

527
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:14,195
We all, in this room,

528
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,697
we love each other.

529
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,576
We want what's best for
each other, and I know that.

530
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,537
I am very thankful
for that.

531
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:28,334
But what I want...

532
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,215
What I want,
what I need...

533
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,177
is a choice.

534
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:42,848
What does that mean?

535
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:49,730
Sometimes I feel like
I never actually

536
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:53,567
make any of my own choices,

537
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,528
I mean.

538
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,952
My entire life,

539
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:06,747
it just seems I never...

540
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:14,129
you know, had a real say
about any of it.

541
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:20,427
Now, this last one, cancer,

542
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:26,475
all I have left is how
I choose to approach this.

543
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:29,645
Then make the right choice, Walt.

544
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,440
You are not the
only one it affects.

545
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,068
What about your son?

546
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:41,949
Don't you wanna see your
daughter grow up? I just...

547
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,998
Of course I do.

548
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:55,588
Skyler, you've read
the statistics, you...

549
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,344
These doctors

550
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,514
talking about "surviving"

551
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:10,269
one year, two years, like it's
the only thing that matters.

552
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:13,314
But what good is it
to just survive

553
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:17,484
if I am too sick to work?

554
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,155
To enjoy a meal?

555
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,034
To make love?

556
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,835
For what time I have left...

557
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,340
I wanna live in my own house.

558
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,343
I wanna sleep in my own bed.

559
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,138
I don't wanna choke down
30 or 40 pills every single day,

560
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,514
and lose my hair,

561
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:52,478
and lie around,
too tired to get up,

562
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:58,651
and so nauseated
that I can't even move my head.

563
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,529
And you.

564
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,366
Cleaning up
after me.

565
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,662
And me? What...?

566
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:12,331
Some, uh...

567
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:17,211
Some dead man,
some artificially alive...

568
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,090
Just marking time.

569
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,843
No. No.

570
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:31,475
And that's how you
would remember me.

571
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,858
That's the worst part.

572
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:48,867
So that is my thought process,
Skyler.

573
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:53,205
I'm sorry. I just...

574
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,713
I choose not to do it.

575
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,912
All right.

576
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,376
"All right" what?

577
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:08,048
I'll do the treatment.

578
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,415
It's gonna be okay.

579
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,750
Okay.

580
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:10,986
The lady from
the billing office

581
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:14,114
said they usually bill the
insurance company directly.

582
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:18,660
But since our HMO's not paying for it,
we can pay up front with a credit card.

583
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:21,622
Oh. Good.

584
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:26,668
Oh, and then Elliott
will send a check, right?

585
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,630
I will take care of it, yeah.

586
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,345
Walter White?

587
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,639
Yes.

588
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,643
Okay.

589
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,478
- All right.
- Okay.

590
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:47,481
See you in a minute. Okay.
Okay.

591
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,073
Heh-heh. Elliott.

592
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,617
Walt, it's Gretchen.

593
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:27,414
Oh, hey. Hey, Gretchen,
how are you?

594
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:31,418
You know, it was really great seeing
you two the other day, you know.

595
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,545
Wow, what a party.

596
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:38,550
Walt, Elliott told me
about the cancer.

597
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:42,054
I'm so sorry.

598
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:44,973
Well, you know,

599
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,809
it is what it is, I guess.

600
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:50,103
I don't know what to say.

601
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,357
Except, I'm always here for you.

602
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,402
Both of us are.
We wanted you to know that.

603
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:01,365
Yeah, well, thank you.

604
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:07,662
Walt, Elliott told me he'd offered
to pay for the treatment.

605
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:08,955
You have to accept.

606
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:13,794
That money, as far as we're both
concerned, that belongs to you.

607
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,506
Even the name of our
company, it's half yours.

608
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,176
Walt?

609
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,265
Is this about you and me?

610
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,822
Gretchen, I really
appreciate the offer.

611
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,534
I do. But we're fine.

612
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:50,163
As it turns out, the insurance
came through after all.

613
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:55,919
So, um, I am covered.
And, uh...

614
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:59,005
Well, and, anyway,
I really appreciate it, I really do.

615
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,007
Thank you.

616
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:04,344
Good. That's good news.

617
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,057
You know, that really
was a great party.

618
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:16,815
Keep in touch, okay?
Sure. Sure.

619
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,234
And thank you for calling.

620
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,201
Yo!

621
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:19,503
Wanna cook?
