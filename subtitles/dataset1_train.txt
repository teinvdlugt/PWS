alicia , i have been thinking about ...
i let you realize the inability to discuss the situation with you .
i don' t have other choice .
i do understand .
i' m ... really sorry .
that' s okay .
everything is going to be alright .
everything is going to be alright .
just have to talk quietly .
they maybe listening .
there maybe microphones .
when i am telling you everything now , it' s breaking the protocol .
but you need to know .
because you have to help me to get out off here .
alicia , i have been doing top secret work for the government .
there is the threaten exist .
we cannot stop them for portions .
lnteractions .
my profile is too high .
so i just simply don' t do it with me .
they are keeping me here , because i tried to stop from doing my work .
you have to go to wheeler .
you have find william patcher ...
stop ...
stop !
you help me ...
stop !
i went to wheeler .
good ...

there is no patcher .
of course there are , i have been working for ...
doing what ?
breaking codes ?
dropping the packages at the secret mailbox for the government to pick up ?
how do you know that ?
sow followed you .
they haven' t been opened .
it isn' t real .
there is no conspirancy , john .

dr rosen , code red .
observation room 2 .
john ?
john ?
the implant' s gone .
i can' t find it .
it' s gone .
he has the nightmare because his friend there .
he' s not knowing what' s true .
lmagine that he would suddenly learn that the people , the places and the moments .
most important to him are all gone .
not there .
but worse , they' ve never been .
one kind of hell would that be .
administering insulin .
how often ?
five times a week .
john always spoke so fondly being here in princeton .
and hensen is running the department now .
so he keep reminding us , reminding us .
yeah .
john won' t come here to the campus though .
it is a shame .
alicia , how ... how are you holding up ?
division has passed .
they are saying with medication and those dressing in ...
no ...
i mean ...
i mean how are you ?
i think often when i feel ...
it' s obligation .
a guilt ... over warning to leave .
rich , i guess .
john ... against god ...
but then i look at him .
and i force to see myself the man that i married .
and he becomes that man that he has transform into someone that i love .
and i transform to someone who loves him .
it' s not all of the time , but ... it' s enough .
i think john is a very lucky man , alicia .
someone lucky ...
this is ours .
this is it ?
it' s nice .
it' s here where i work .
john , you have a visitor .
hi .
hi .
i hope it' s okay .
hey , chief .

i' m okay .
it' s okay .
so ...
i was in town giving a workshop .
i' il go back tonight .
you know bender ...
he really wanted to stop by ... and something like seeing you ...
you know , say hi .
i suppose that would be too .
but at last , i' m stop with me .
i' m trying to hold the remark on hypothesis .
i figure if i have dazzled it , they would have to reinstead me .
first , it' s difficult with the medication ... because it is hard to see the solution .
you know , john .
you should go easy .
there are other things besides ... besides work .
what are they ?
what are you thinking about ?
what do people do ?
slave , john .
activities are normal .
just have meaning .
you could try live in a house .
you know , maybe try talk to people .
you can try taking out the garbage .
who ... who' re talking to ?
garbage man .
garbage man don' t come at night .
i guess here around , they do .
sorry .
ls that the medication ?
my mother is going to keep the baby a little longer tonight .
i' il get three hour overtime .
i' m going to bed .
good night .
good night .
good to see you , john .
it has been a while .
patcher ?
yes , sir .
you' re not real .
of course i am .
don' t be ridiculous .
and don' t think that i will go that way , john .
it' s time for you to get back to work .
the bomb is in it' s final position .
here in u. s.
knowing your position , you' il keep a low profile .
we have brought it to the mountain , to you .
we have known the bomb' s location somewhere in the eastern seabroad .
but we haven' t able to pin point it' s exact position .
their codes have grow to increasing complex .
look at this , john .
what ?
what ?
dr rosen said ...
let' s get to the definite reality .
psychological bullshit !
look at me , john .
john , look at me .
do i look like an imagine ?
wheeler has no record of you .
do you think we list our personal ?
john , i' m sorry that you have to go through all these .
i' ve gone to a great deal of trouble to get you back .
i can restore your status in wheeler .
i can let the world know what you did .
but i need you now , soldier .
i am so scared that you are not real .
listen , i' m not coming .
i am just going to grab the laundry , okay ?
i' il do his bath .
it' s okay .
okay .
john ?
this is going to wet the baby' s .
oh god ...
charles was here .
he said it was okay .
there' s no one here .
charles was watching ...
there' s no one here .
he has been injecting with the insulin ...
i can see him because it was release in my blood stream ...
and my imply resolve .
i can' t tell you because it is all under protection .
alicia ...
no ...
hello , i need dr rosen' s office please .
you got to stop her , john .
you leave her out of this .
who are you talking to ?
it' s not her fault .
john .
it' s your comprimises again ...
don' t you won' t .
you' il go back to the hospital .
john , answer me !
can' t please people , or you will die .
alicia , please put the phone down .
i can' t let that happen .
yes , hello .
yeah , i need dr rosen .
ls he in ?
i' m sorry i have to do that .
no ! ...
alicia , you know i have to do that .
go away from me ...
she is too greater risk .
go away .
i don' t mean to hurt you .

she knows too much now .
uncle john .
you take care your pathetic piece of shit or i' il take care off you .
john .
john , please .

uncle john .
john , please .

charles is watching her .
with alicia .
i understand .
she never gets old .
marcee can' t be real .
she never gets old .
you see them now ?
yes .
why did you stop your medicine ?
because i couldn' t do my work .
i couldn' t help with the baby .
i couldn' t ...
i couldn' t respond to my wife .
i think that' s getting better than being crazy .
we' il need to start you on a higher run of insulin shoots and your medication ...
no .
it has to be another way .
gets to it is generative .
someday it' s maybe symptom free .
but overtime , you' re getting worse .
it' s a problem .
so it is .
it' s a problem with no solution .
and that' s what i do .
i solve problems .
it isn' t math .
you can' t come up with a formula that you can change the way you experience the world .
all i have to do is plan my mind .
no theory , no proof .
there isn' t a way out of this .
why cannot ?
because your mind is the problem in the first place .
i can do this .
i can work it out .
all i need is time .
ls that the baby ?
baby is still at my mother' s , john .
without treatment , john .
pathetics may take over .
entirely .
you are almost ready .
rosen is waiting outside .
i can' t go back to that hospital .
i won' t come home .
he has commitment papers for me to sign .
or maybe you won' t sign .
maybe you just give us sometime .
i will try to figure this out .
what ever you do .
rosen is right about one thing .
you shouldn' t be here .
i am not safe anymore .
would you have hurt me , john ?
i don' t know .
maybe i should let dr rosen try to determine .
rosen said you wasn' t tried to kill me or anything .
you will know what' s real .
this ...
this ...
this is real .
make me the partner to awake from the dream .
maybe isn' t you .
maybe it' s here .
i need to believe that something extraordinary is possible .
come .
hello , martin .
jesus christ .
i don' t have that one , my savor complex text on the completely different form .
i heard what had happened .
i wanted to write .
i tried to call you since you left ...
this is helinger' s old office .
yeah ...
i stole it from him .
it seems that you won after all , martin .
they were wrong , john .
no one wins .
please .
have a seat .
it' s so good to see you .
what brings you back to priceton ?
john ...
john , i' m sorry .
but you have to tell him .
tell him you are a genius , john .
tell him your work is critical , please .
ls there any chance that you could ignore what i just did ?
of course , what' s old friends for ?
ls that what we are , martin ?
friends ?
john , of course .
of course , we always have been .
alicia and i think that ...
i have to fit in to a part of the community .
that might be some good .
there are several attachments .
familiar places , familiar people .
might help me elbow out ... from this ... from this certain delusions that i have .
it is a lot to ask .
so i am here .
quite some of the people just say no .
but i was wondering if i could hang around .
will you be needing an office ?
no ...
no ... lcould just work out in the library .
this guy is trying to loiter in the library .
but he doesn' t have an ld .
why can' t people read their memos , huh ?
then he goes totally nuts .
shit ...
shit ...
you are not real ...
ls that what you are , soldier ?
some useless cold .
the local banned man ?
i am not a soldier .
you can handle by yourself .
all .
old , worthless , disguided .
there' s no mission .
the world that you are walking through , the world will burn ash .
you are not real .
you' re still talking to me , soldier .
there' s no mission .
i am not a soldier .
john ...
hey , it' s okay .
i just heard what happen .
i' m sorry , john .
i' m not a soldier .
john ...
hey , nash .
you are alright .
hey , nash .
ladies and gentlemen , great john nash !
john !
you should have seen those faces .
everybody' s staring at me .
john ...
you know that stress treats you the delusions .
i know .
but i don' t know the way how ...
charles was there .
sometimes i really miss talking to him .
maybe rosen' s right .
maybe i should think about going back to the hospital again .
come here .
maybe try again tomorrow .
john , you can' t let go me forever .
charles , you are a very good friend to me .
the best .
but i won' t talk to you again .
i just can' t .
the same goes to you , baby .
goodbye .
goodbye .
how is it matter if i' m on your course ?
it' s ... it' s an honour , professor nash .

this would be my first class .
good morning , young lifes .
it' s just not going to work , john .
you' re just humiliating yourself .
it' s pathetic .
you' re being pathetic .
i' m ashamed of you .
are you coming ?
you' re going to be late .
dad , you got my book .
what ?
you got my book .
thanks .
goodbye .
see you tonight .
bye , honey .
do you just solve rima ?
what do you think ?
that' s an analogue for non communitive extensions .
yes , it is .
it' s just a piece of work , not so prodically , so ...
but ...
i believe i' m making progress .
you' re ... you' re john nash , right ?
toby collard .
hello .
i' m studying your record .
the one you wrote here at princeton .
to come up with something totally original the way you did .
you know , i was young .
i have been developing a theory .
i believe i can prove the extentions in covering space .
that everything ... everything is connected .
that is all part of the same subject .
when was the last time you ate ?
excuse me .
you know , food .
my wife , she loves mayonnaise .
thank you .
go on .
the factor is in two categories .
alicia .
i was thinking i am not a teacher .
classroom with 50 students could be don thing for anyone .
john , besides you are a terrible teacher .
i am a quiet taste , martin .
i was just hoping that there is something that i can contribute .
what about the ...
you know , are they gone ?
no , they are not gone .
maybe they never will be .
but i got used to ignore .
i think they are kind of giving up on me .
you think that is what' s like .
all our dreams and nightmares , martin ?
we got to keep feeding them to let them stay alive ?
john , they haunted you ...
they might past .
no body is haunted by their past .
well , goodbye .
john , i' il talk to the department .
maybe in the spring .
hey , nash .
you' re ... scared ?
terrify , modify , petrify , stupidfy by you .
thanks , professor .
goodbye .
have a nice day .
goodbye .
see you .
professor nash .
can you see him ?
ya .
are you sure ?
how is he ?
good .
forgive me .
i' m just always suspicious in old people .
see you next week , professor .
see you next week .
so now that i know you are real .
who are you and what can i do for you ?
professor , my name is thomas king .
and i am here to tell you that you' ve been considered to the nobel prize .
look at me .
i' m just a little stun .
over the past few years , your equal liberty has become a corner stone of modern economics .
suddenly everybody just about to like that one .
what about my work in some other project ?
some mathematic ?
the application of your bargaining problem to f. c. c. banned with auctions or to any trust cases ...
trust cases ?
yes .
i never would have princip on that .
i just lead some honesty to some stupidity .
no , you haven' t .
i would never had thought about that .
shall we have tea ?
i don' t go in there .
i usually just take my sandwich in the library .
come on , john .
let' s have some tea .
it' s a big day .
most commercial have my tea in the palette .
there was some northern lndian tea , that i enjoyed the flavour ...
i have not been in this room for quite so many years ...
things are certainly change around here .
i have a son that age .
harvard .
i thought the receivers of the nobel prize is to be secreted .
i thought you won' t have find out if you have won or lost .
that is generally the case , but this is circumstances .
the award is just substantial .
they require private funding as such ... the image of the nobel ...
oh i see .
you come here just to find out if i' m crazy .
find out if i' il screw out everything that i actually want .
strip naked like a chicken thing pours around the nature .
something like that , yes .
but i embarass you .
yes , it is possible .
you see ...
i am crazy .
i take medications .
i still see things that is not real .
i just choose not to acknowledge .
i could die after mad .
i choose not to and indulge certain appetites .
like my appetite to patterns .
perhaps my appetite to imagine , to dream .
professor nash .
it' s good to have you here , john .
it' s an honour , sir .
thank you very much .
a privilege , professor .
professor .
thank you .
thank you there .
that is most certainly unexpected .
thank you .
i' ve always believe in numbers .
ln equations , and logics that lead to reasons .
but after lifetime of such persuade ,
i asked , what truly is logic .
who decides its reason .
my quests has take them in to the physical , the mental physical , the delusional and back .
and i' ve made the most important discovery of my career .
the most important discovery of my life .
it is only a mysterious quest of love .
that any logical reasons can be found .
and i am only hitted because of you .
you are the reason i am .
you are all my reasons .
thank you .
i' il call for the car , dad .
are you ready to go now ?
oh yes , i am .
yes , indeed .
yes , please .
thank you so much .
thank you .
what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
no .
nothing .
nothing at all .
come with me , young lady .
there on a windswept bluff , he stands waiting .

billy schnar ?
we" re the smartest in class .
you know who he likes ?
guess !
who ?
melissa thomas , you know her ?
the one with braces and ugly red hair .
she thought israel was in europe .
you know why he likes her ?
guess !
because she" s stupid .
no , because she" s got boobs !
or it looks like she does , but she doesn" t .
she wears a bra ... ... which s q uishes her fat together ... ... and makes her look like she has big boobs .
pop , l" m gonna die if i don" t marry billy schnar .
l" m gonna die all because melissa has boobs ?
that" s just way too tragic , even for shakespeare .
okay , pop , so that" s why for christmas , l" d like a bra .
to enhance what i got , which is more than melissa .
you" re too young .
pop , you can" t negotiate my boobs .
too young or not , l" ve got them .
l" m a woman .
it" s hard to see through my clothes .
q uiet !
the answer is no .
keep your mind on books , not boys .
t his is w hy therapists are w ealthy . : moments like this .
w hy didn ' t he just get her the bra ? / t ' s certainly cheaper than a bicycle .
p arents and the damage they can do .
sometimes , it ' s endless .

sky has had his hands in everything you got .

my daughter" s a tramp .

okay , go .
you can do it .
maybe you should tell ray first .
okay .
in puerto rico you can get rid of it , but i don" t have any money .
do you have any money ?
no .
that" s it , then .
i have to throw myself at my parents " mercy .
if they help me take care of the baby , i can get a job and save money .
that" d be good .
then i could move to new york , get a job at a newspaper .
nothing big , something small .
i can" t .

there are times in a man" s life when there is cause to celebrate .

... fornohomeis immune to termites ... nomatterhow well itisbuiltormaintained .
hey , brother .

you wanna go with me ?
hey , look , man .
you can have six million termites in your house and don' t even know it ... till you going to get something to eat and you bust through the floor .
what' d you say ?
where ?
africa .

africa .
all right , come on .
let' s go .
what is it ?
you ever thought you' d lose it ?
i mean , really lose it ?
when i was little , i tore out this picture of emmett till .
they put the barbed wire around his neck ... and strapped him to that 75 pound cotton gin fan .
and they cut out one ofhis eyes ' cause he looked at some white lady .
man .
i couldn' t take my eyes to it , couldn' t throw it away .
when i heard about those ... four little girls who got bombed in that birmingham church ...
the prohibitions ofthe honorable elijah muhammad prevented me ... from speaking my thoughts in action .
because birmingham was part ofthe civil rights struggle .
you know , begging for our place at the white man' s table .
but dead children are dead children .
so the anger i felt i had to contain .
i locked it up so tight ... my muscles seized .
i lost control over the right side ofmy body .
my leg gave out .
right arm gave out .
i' m having a stroke , " i thought .
but i had to hold it in ' cause all i wanted
brother , all i wanted to do was find something and break it .
break a part break any part ofthis system ... becauseyou are so provoked in your heart ... and your spirit as a human being ... at dead children .
and i could do ... nothing .
everyone knows i can' t do nothing ... anymore .
so elijah muhammad has suspended me as a minister in the nation oflslam .
man ... you can fix that .
i don' t know .
i' il trywhen we get back .
you get some rest , champ .
all right , brother .
sit .
you know , only after long service and high merit ... in the spiritual and physical rebirth ofafro american people ... is one granted an original name .
butyou are special .
a world champion .
so there is a gift i wish to giveyou .
from this day forward ... you will be known as muhammad ali .

i got a much bigger contender , a much heavier opponent .
i' m fightin ' the entire us government .
doyou think you' re going tojail ?
i don' t know .

joe frazier told me on this show that he could knockyou out .
see , thereyou go agitatin ' .
you should' ve asked smokin' joe what have he been smokin ' ?
that boy even dream he whupped me , he betterwake up and apologize .
ifl was togetin thering withjoe ... here' s whatyoumightsee .
ali comes out to meet frazier , but frazier starts to retreat .
ifjoe goes back an inch farther , he' il wind up in a ringside seat .
ali swings with his left , ali swings with his right .
just look at the kid carry the fight .
frazier keeps backin ' , but there' s not enough room .
it' s only a matter oftime before ali lowers the boom .
aliswings withhis right .
whatabeautifulswing .
but thepunch lifts frazier clean outofthering .
frazier' s still risin ' , and the referee wears a frown ...
' cause he can' t start countin ' till frazier comes down .
frazier' s disappeared from view .
the crowd is getting frantic .
but our radar stations picked him up .
he' s somewheres over the atlantic .
now , who would' ve thought when they came to the fight ... theywas gonna witness the launchin ' ofa black satellite .

muhammad ali and george foreman in kinshasa , zaire .
don , zaire ?
yeah , don .
i mean , why not antarctica , somethin ' like that ?
what' s wrong with new york city ?
becauseyou miss the significance .
see , i dream ofovercoming 400 years ofracial depression ... to the dawn ofa new day ofliberation , financial and otherwise .
it will raise up the spirits ofour inner cities .
it will rise up and fill with hope , the souls ... the unrequited needs ofthe black proletariat .
that is , the discouraged , dispirited , denigrated denizens ... ofthe demimonde that is called the ghetto .
man , don , you crazy .
you must' ve studied the whole " d " section ofthe dictionary .
good morning , sister .
hi , brother .
howyou doin ' , champ ?
why they saying that ?
what they sayin ' ?
what that mean ?
i don' t understand .
it means  what ?
it mean , " ali , kill him .
ali , kill him .
the champ is here !
ladies and gentlemen , the heavyweight champion ofthe world has arrived !
the champ is here !
hey , man .
he' s quiteyounger than you .
howyou feeling about that ?
he' s quiteyounger than me ?
well , we quiteyounger than you .
whatyou talkin ' about ?
thirty two years old .
best shape ofmy life .
hey , stop !
all right , back up .
did you see muhammad ali ?
here' s yourwater .
oh , thankyou , hon .
bottled water .
frozen steaks .
brought all that stuffin like africa' s ain' t got no steaks .
you could pick up parasites .
mobutu eats it .
mobutu' s takin ' care of mobutu .
he steals all the wealth and sends it to switzerland .
what that got to do with any ofwhywe here ?
we are here ' cause don king got mobutu to put up $1 0 million .
don king don' t care about africa .
he' s worse than herbert .
here come herbert .
and don king fit right in too .
now he' s a dashiki wearin ' rip off .
don king delivered the first ever ... black promoted championship fight in africa .
don king talks black , lives white and thinks green .
and you' re defending him and brother herbert ?
' cause clean cut muslims in a parade on the south side ofchicago ... ain' t gonna get this done !
i got to put honkies with connections and bad ass niggas to it .
and now they matched you up against george foreman .
doyou think they give a damn ifyou get killed ?
so that' s whatyou think ?
i just wanna know why my muslim husband ... is allowing himself to get strung up on a cross .
just tell me why .
maryum' s sick .
maybe i ought to go back to chicago and look after her ?
sure .
well , then i guess i' il be back before the fight .
ifthat' s all right , my husband .
this fight is no contest !
he is entirely too slow to fight me .
i say that george foreman is a mummy .
he' s too slow .
you know i name all my fighters .
i' m gonna call george foreman " the mummy .
he fight like a mummy .
here come the left .
here come the right .
but the mummy can' t hit what the mummy can' t see ...
' cause i' m too fast for him .
i' m too fast .
i' m too fast .
i' m too fast .
i move too good for him .
i' il hit george foreman so many times , he' il think he' s surrounded .
he gonna say , " call the police !
it' s five of' em in here !
i' m bad , man .
i' m bad !
muhammad , i' m sorry .
i have to ask .
areyou really fast enough anymore ... to beat george foreman ?
ifhe gets you against the ropes , he can knockyou out with either hand .
many people believeyou' re not the man you used to be ten years ago .
see , now , howard ...
i didn' t even want to talk about this , man .
especially not out here in front ofall these people .
but i talked toyourwife ... and she said you not the man you used to be twoyears ago !
champ .
champ , george had an accident .
he he had what ?
what areyou talking about ?
he got cut right above his right eye .
his sparring partner' s elbow split it open .
can he fight ?
not for six weeks .
this is not a humorous situation , my champ .
this postponement could be long , especially ifgeorge leaves .
you trying to pull something here , don ?
ifgeorge leaves , he ain' t comin ' back .
george don' t like it here .
how rightyou are , my suspicious and short ltalian brother .
look here , man , my fiduciary responsibility ... to this first all black promotion ... is analogous to a garden in the african sun it must grow , it must bloom .
cannot flower in the gloom and shade ofpostponement to the astrodome ... or any dome out ofzaire where it be deprivileged oflight and bled ofwater .
' cause what gonna be bleedin ' out of there is money a hemorrhage ofcash .
i' m talkin ' about blood on the floor .
double hotel costs , airplane , travel costs , food and beverage .
so what doyou want us to do ?
muhammad ali .
the people' s champion .
my black brother .
i need you .
i need your strength .
i need you to find a way to get george to stay .
be moses in reverse .
do not let my people go .
keep them the fuck right here in egypt .
ifyou' il pardon my swahili .
lingala .
saywhat ?
they speak lingala .
ali wants his title , and he wants it in zaire .
okay , all right , okay .
let' s take it back .
george go , george go .
hell , i can getyoujoe frazier .
ali frazier 3 .
that' s the fight everybodywant to see .
we don' t want frazier , we want george .
hell , i don' t control george foreman .
there' s been an accidental injury to george foreman in training .
the truth is ...
george knocked hisselfout .
that' s right .
he did three rounds , realized he was gonna lose to muhammad ali ... and knocked hisselfout .
i predict that when the fight is set , he might not show .
oh , you bad .
that' s right , i' m a bad man .
ain' t no doubt about that .
yeah , butyou tell george the same thing .
i heard you .
i been watching you .
i know he' s your man , i knowyou got him picked , but the man is in trouble .
the whole world was gonna know , but now he ain' t gonna show .
in order to ensure that george is ready , we are thinking ofpostponing ... from september 24 to october 30 .
what about the concert ?
the concert will go on as planned .
those dates are september 20 , 21
i want all the helicopters guarded , all the private planes , private boats .
i' m serious .
i want the airports
i want president mobutu and all his paratroopers
all you zaireans , y' all be on guard too .
any strange boats creeping away , they might be taking him out .
bus stations .
and bus stations !
right .
watch the bus stations .
the elephant caravans they might be trying to take him out on an elephant .
what' d you say ?
hell , i ain' t talking toyou .
hey .
hey , man .
don' tyou never talk to angelo like that .
don' tyou never talk to angie like that again .
something wrong with you , man ?

you ain' t callin ' nothin ' .
they all know .
all them ladies out there , they know i' m ready .
i see fear in the eyes ofhis followers .
this was supposed to be the fight that muhammad ali was ended .
supposed to be muhammad was gonna fall .
supposed to be my destruction .

they misjudged .
they got it wrong .

george foreman has been knocked out by muhammad ali !
muhammad ali has done the impossible !
he has regained the heavyweight crown ... that was taken unjustly from him in 1 967 .
what a moment ofhistory in this arena ... in zaire , africa !
a tremendous , tremendous moment .
norton , he' s big and strong , but he ain' t nothin ' .
hold on a second , joe .
they' re telling me we have a caller .
go ahead , please .
cosell , this is muhammad ali .
it' s muhammad ali .
everybody knows that i am the champ .
the crown is a lie .
i know it' s a lie .
joe frazier knows it' s a lie .
and it' s time for everybody to stop lying and tell the truth .
let' s tell it like it is .
with your court and boxingproblems ... can you get a fight promoted ?
i would fight joe frazier for free in a phone booth ... in the middle of times square if i wasn' t broke .
did you say you were broke ?
how can you be broke ?
you made more money than all previous heavyweights champions combined .
what about your management ?
surely they have provided for you .
all i' m trying to say is it' s time for everybody to stop lyin ' .
muhammad ali is the champ .
get my son herbert on the telephone .
muhammad , thank you for calling in .
i' il relay that to joe .
and tell joe i said he is very ugly .
muhammad says that he will fight you anywhere , anytime ... and that the championship really is his until that battle ensues .
mr. ali has sporting blood .
mr. ali wants a place in this sports world .
he loves it too much .
i am therefore suspending mr. ali from the practice of islam .
he may no longer appear in temple , pray or teach ... or have any conversation with any muslim whatsoever .
why didn ? t you call an ambulance or a doctor ?
because he gave me your number when he checked in .
normally , he' s up there making a lot of noise .
but now he hasn' t answered the door in three days .
what' s that ?
it' s daylight .
get me that short dog .
give it to me .
what' s wrong with you ?
ain' t nothin ' wrong with me .
my head ain' t bad .
leave me alone .
leave you alone .
you called me !
yes , but that was a week ago .
why are you shamin ' yourself ?
let me go , man .
why you doin ' that to yourself ?
why you shamin ' yourself ?
ain' t nobody shamed .
ain' t nothin ' wrong with me .
i' m flyin ' .
the sky chief talk through me .
i know the word .
you know low .
yeah ?
i know low where the king is goin ' back to his throne !
from the root to the fruit !
them rhymes is old , bundini .
you need to get some new ones .
god don' t care about you .
don' t care about me .
in all of everything , we don' t mean nothin ' .
he don' t owe us .
we be .
and that' s the onliest thing he did .
but that' s good .
that' s why we free .
but free ain' t easy .
free is real and real is a motherfucker .
it eats raw meat .
it walk in its own shoes .
it don' t ever waiver .
yeah .
i i sold your belt .
i sold your belt to a barber for $500 on lenox avenue .
that' s how low i did you .
i couldn' t help it .
i got a crazy mind .
that belt say you the heavyweight boxing champion of the world ... and i took that $500 ... and i put it in my arm .
that' s what i called to tell you .
i heard about the nation stuff , the courtroom .
what you gonna do ?
take me back .
i could go down there and get the belt .
i can go get the belt .
hey , champ .
$1 , 000 to the man that bring me howard cosell' s toupee dead or alive !
don' t bother me .
i' m a world famous sportscaster ... and you' re an ex champion with diminished skills .
i can' t be seen with you .
how' s it goin ' , champ ?
pretty good , man .
muhammad , i' d do anything for you .
you know that .
but i' ve got bosses who only give a damn about nielsen ratings .
i guarantee ... it will be a historical and a momentous night .
if they came to me tomorrow and say , " we want you to fight joe frazier .
madison square garden .
millions and millions of dollars .
here' s your license back .
i will tell them ...
i will never fight again .
frankly , muhammad , i' m surprised , because unless you or until you fight frazier
cosell , are you losin ' your hearing along with your hair ?
don' t put no question to it , man .
i done told you , i' m through fightin ' .
i got a much bigger contender , a much heavier opponent .
i' m fightin ' the entire us government .
do you think you' re going to jail ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
joe frazier told me on this show that he could knock you out .
see , there you go agitatin ' .
you should' ve asked smokin ' joe what have he been smokin ' ?
that boy even dream he whupped me , he better wake up and apologize .
if i was to get in the ring with joe ... here' s what you might see .
ali comes out to meet frazier , but frazier starts to retreat .
if joe goes back an inch farther , he' il wind up in a ringside seat .
ali swings with his left , ali swings with his right .
just look at the kid carry the fight .
frazier keeps backin ' , but there' s not enough room .
it' s only a matter of time before ali lowers the boom .
ali swings with his right .
what a beautiful swing .
but the punch lifts frazier clean out of the ring .
frazier' s still risin ' , and the referee wears a frown ...
' cause he can' t start countin ' till frazier comes down .
frazier' s disappeared from view .
the crowd is getting frantic .
but our radar stations picked him up .
he' s somewhere over the atlantic .
now , who would' ve thought when they came to the fight ... they was gonna witness the launchin ' of a black satellite .
but don' t wait for that fight .
it ain' t never gonna happen .
only thing you could do ... is wonder and imagine .
this has been another sports exclusive from abc .
two .
go two .
over to jim mckay ... in bern , switzerland .
how you gonna go from me to jim mckay ?
listen , uh
did your wife leave you yet ?
no , she hasn' t left me yet .
she' s going to , ' cause i told your wife when i seen her ...
i said , " listen , why you doin ' this to yourself ?
oh , man , joe .
who dresses you ?
you look like the heavyweight champion of pimps .
hey , shut up and get in .
that jacket ? s a mess , man .
what you in philly for ?
philly' s my town .
well , i just wanted to get a little closer to you , honey .
man , fuck you .
there' il be two undefeated heavyweight champions , and they ain' t fightin ' .
what about your license ?
i can fight in atlanta .
there ain' t no state boxing commission in georgia .
it' s all set .
i do a prelim in atlanta against jerry quary ... but we got to get this steamroller movin ' right now .
so what do i have to do ?
all you got to do is announce that after i whup jerry quary ... you gonna give me a title shot .
come on , man .
say it !
say it !
what i got and all i got , i got with these right here .
hell , man , i already got the title .
so i ain' t got nothin ' to win , but i got eveythin ' to lose .
yeah , but you know you ain' t the real champ yet .

i' m gonna get you in the ring .
i' m gonna kick your ass .
by the way ... you need any money or anything to tide you by ?
no , i' m fine .

this is a resurrection .
this is god' s act .
and the prophet is goin ' home .

joe done run outta tomato cans ...
i got yank to commit to a rematch with you in about six months .

i think he hurt joe frazier .
i think joe is hurt .

the heavy weight champion is taking the mandatory eightcount ... and foreman i spoised as can be .
foreman is all over frazier .
and frazier is down again !
he maybe no , he' s rising .
it' s over !
it is over !
it' d be easy to get a fight with frazier now .
only thing he' s champion of is gettin ' knocked down .
george foreman is the heavyweight champion of the world .
the rumble in the jungle .
that is the name that i' ve given it .
muhammad ali and george foreman in kinshasa , zaire .
don , zaire ?
yeah , don .
i mean , why not antarctica , somethin ' like that ?
what' s wrong with new york city ?
because you miss the significance .
see , i dream of overcoming 400 years of racial depression ... to the dawn of a new day of liberation , financial and otherwise .
it will raise up the spirits of our inner cities .
it will rise up and fill with hope , the souls ... the unrequited needs of the black proletariat .
that is , the discouraged , dispirited , denigrated denizens ... of the demimonde that is called the ghetto .
man , don , you crazy .
you must' ve studied the whole " d " section of the dictionary .
good morning , sister .
hi , brother .
how you doin ' , champ ?
why they saying that ?
what they sayin ' ?
what that mean ?
i don' t understand .
it means  what ?
it mean , " ali , kill him .
ali , kill him .
the champ is here !
ladies and gentlemen , the heavyweight champion of the world has arrived !
the champ is here !
hey , man .
he' s quite younger than you .
how you feeling about that ?
he' s quite younger than me ?
well , we quite younger than you .
what you talkin ' about ?
thirty two years old .
best shape of my life .
hey , stop !
all right , back up .
did you see muhammad ali ?
here' s your water .
oh , thank you , hon .
bottled water .
frozen steaks .
brought all that stuffin like africa' s ain' t got no steaks .
you could pick up parasites .
mobutu eats it .
mobutu' s takin ' care of mobutu .
he steals all the wealth and sends it to switzerland .
what that got to do with any of why we here ?
we are here ' cause don king got mobutu to put up $1 0 million .
don king don' t care about africa .
he' s worse than herbert .
here come herbert .
and don king fit right in too .
now he' s a dashiki wearin ' rip off .
don king delivered the first ever ... black promoted championship fight in africa .
don king talks black , lives white and thinks green .
and you' re defending him and brother herbert ?
' cause clean cut muslims in a parade on the south side of chicago ... ain' t gonna get this done !
i got to put honkies with connections and bad ass niggas to it .
and now they matched you up against george foreman .
do you think they give a damn if you get killed ?
so that' s what you think ?
i just wanna know why my muslim husband ... is allowing himself to get strung up on a cross .
just tell me why .
mayum' s sick .
maybe i ought to go back to chicago and look after her ?
sure .
well , then i guess i' il be back before the fight .
if that ? s all right , my husband .
this fight is no contest !
he is entirely too slow to fight me .
i say that george foreman is a mummy .
he' s too slow .
you know i name all my fighters .
i' m gonna call george foreman " the mummy .
he fight like a mummy .
here come the left .
here come the right .
but the mummy can' t hit what the mummy can' t see ...
' cause i' m too fast for him .
i' m too fast .
i' m too fast .
i' m too fast .
i move too good for him .
i' il hit george foreman so many times , he' il think he' s surrounded .
he gonna say , " call the police !
it' s five of ' em in here !
i' m bad , man .
i' m bad !
muhammad , i' m sorry .
i have to ask .
are you really fast enough anymore ... to beat george foreman ?
if he gets you against the ropes , he can knock you out with either hand .
many people believe you ? re not the man you used to be ten years ago .
see , now , howard ...
i didn' t even want to talk about this , man .
especially not out here in front of all these people .
but i talked to your wife ... and she said you not the man you used to be two years ago !
champ .
champ , george had an accident .
he he had what ?
what are you talking about ?
he got cut right above his right eye .
his sparring partner' s elbow split it open .
can he fight ?
not for six weeks .
this is not a humorous situation , my champ .
this postponement could be long , especially if george leaves .
you tying to pull something here , don ?
if george leaves , he ain' t comin ' back .
george don' t like it here .
how right you are , my suspicious and short italian brother .
look here , man , my fiduciary responsibility ... to this first all black promotion ... is analogous to a garden in the african sun it must grow , it must bloom .
cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to the astrodome ... or any dome out of zaire where it be deprivileged of light and bled of water .
' cause what gonna be bleedin ' out of there is money a hemorrhage of cash .
i' m talkin ' about blood on the floor .
double hotel costs , airplane , travel costs , food and beverage .
so what do you want us to do ?
muhammad ali .
the people' s champion .
my black brother .
i need you .
i need your strength .
i need you to find a way to get george to stay .
be moses in reverse .
do not let my people go .
keep them the fuck right here in egypt .
if you ? il pardon my swahili .
lingala .
say what ?
they speak lingala .
ali wants his title , and he wants it in zaire .
okay , all right , okay .
let' s take it back .
george go , george go .
hell , i can get you joe frazier .
ali frazier 3 .
that' s the fight everybody want to see .
we don' t want frazier , we want george .
hell , i don' t control george foreman .
there' s been an accidental injury to george foreman in training .
the truth is ...
george knocked his self out .
that' s right .
he did three rounds , realized he was gonna lose to muhammad ali ... and knocked his self out .
i predict that when the fight is set , he might not show .
oh , you bad .
that' s right , i' m a bad man .
ain' t no doubt about that .
yeah , but you tell george the same thing .
i heard you .
i been watching you .
i know he' s your man , i know you got him picked , but the man is in trouble .
the whole world was gonna know , but now he ain' t gonna show .
in order to ensure that george is ready , we are thinking of postponing ... from september 24 to october 30 .
what about the concert ?
the concert will go on as planned .
those dates are september 20 , 21
i want all the helicopters guarded , all the private planes , private boats .
i' m serious .
i want the airports
i want president mobutu and all his paratroopers
all you zaireans , y' all be on guard too .
any strange boats creeping away , they might be taking him out .
bus stations .
and bus stations !
right .
watch the bus stations .
the elephant caravans they might be tying to take him out on an elephant .
what' d you say ?
hell , i ain' t talking to you .
hey .
hey , man .
don ? t you never talk to angelo like that .
don ? t you never talk to angie like that again .
something wrong with you , man ?
think you callin ' some shots here ?

we already got turned down there .
i' m petitioning on a conscientious objection basis .
religious belief .
i believe that they' il hear that .
where the money gonna come from , chauncey ?
herbert say i' m runnin' on empty .

hold on a second , joe .
they' re telling me we have a caller .
go ahead , please .
cosell , this is muhammad ali .
it' s muhammad ali .
everybody knows that i am the champ .
the crown is a lie .
i know it' s a lie .
joe frazier knows it' s a lie .
and it' s time for everybody to stop lying and tell the truth .
let' s tell it like it is .
with your court and boxing problems ... can you get a fight promoted ?
i would fight joe frazier for free in a phone booth ... in the middle of times square if i wasn' t broke .
did you say you were broke ?
how can you be broke ?
you made more money than all previous heavyweights champions combined .
what about your management ?
surely they have provided for you .
all i' m trying to say is it' s time for everybody to stop lyin ' .
muhammad ali is the champ .
get my son herbert on the telephone .
muhammad , thank you for calling in .
i' il relay that to joe .
and tell joe i said he is very ugly .
muhammad says that he will fight you anywhere , anytime ... and that the championship really is his until that battle ensues .
mr. ali has sporting blood .
mr. ali wants a place in this sports world .
he loves it too much .
i am therefore suspending mr. ali from the practice of islam .
he may no longer appear in temple , pray or teach ... or have any conversation with any muslim whatsoever .
why didn ? t you call an ambulance or a doctor ?
because he gave me your number when he checked in .
normally , he' s up there making a lot of noise .
but now he hasn' t answered the door in three days .
what' s that ?
it' s daylight .
get me that short dog .
give it to me .
what' s wrong with you ?
ain' t nothin ' wrong with me .
my head ain' t bad .
leave me alone .
leave you alone .
you called me !
yes , but that was a week ago .
why are you shamin ' yourself ?
let me go , man .
why you doin ' that to yourself ?
why you shamin ' yourself ?
ain' t nobody shamed .
ain' t nothin ' wrong with me .
i' m flyin ' .
the sky chief talk through me .
i know the word .
you know low .
yeah ?
i know low where the king is goin ' back to his throne !
from the root to the fruit !
them rhymes is old , bundini .
you need to get some new ones .
god don' t care about you .
don' t care about me .
in all of everything , we don' t mean nothin ' .
he don' t owe us .
we be .
and that' s the onliest thing he did .
but that' s good .
that' s why we free .
but free ain' t easy .
free is real and real is a motherfucker .
it eats raw meat .
it walk in its own shoes .
it don' t ever waiver .
yeah .
i i sold your belt .
i sold your belt to a barber for $500 on lenox avenue .
that' s how low i did you .
i couldn' t help it .
i got a crazy mind .
that belt say you the heavyweight boxing champion of the world ... and i took that $500 ... and i put it in my arm .
that' s what i called to tell you .
i heard about the nation stuff , the courtroom .
what you gonna do ?
take me back .
i could go down there and get the belt .
i can go get the belt .
hey , champ .
$1 , 000 to the man that bring me howard cosell' s toupee dead or alive !
don' t bother me .
i' m a world famous sportscaster ... and you' re an ex champion with diminished skills .
i can' t be seen with you .
how' s it goin ' , champ ?
pretty good , man .
muhammad , i' d do anything for you .
you know that .
but i' ve got bosses who only give a damn about nielsen ratings .
i guarantee ... it will be a historical and a momentous night .
if they came to me tomorrow and say , " we want you to fight joe frazier .
madison square garden .
millions and millions of dollars .
here' s your license back .
i will tell them ...
i will never fight again .
frankly , muhammad , i' m surprised , because unless you or until you fight frazier
cosell , are you losin ' your hearing along with your hair ?
don' t put no question to it , man .
i done told you , i' m through fightin ' .
i got a much bigger contender , a much heavier opponent .
i' m fightin ' the entire us government .
do you think you' re going to jail ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
joe frazier told me on this show that he could knock you out .
see , there you go agitatin ' .
you should' ve asked smokin ' joe what have he been smokin ' ?
that boy even dream he whupped me , he better wake up and apologize .
if i was to get in the ring with joe ... here' s what you might see .
ali comes out to meet frazier , but frazier starts to retreat .
if joe goes back an inch farther , he' il wind up in a ringside seat .
ali swings with his left , ali swings with his right .
just look at the kid carry the fight .
frazier keeps backin ' , but there' s not enough room .
it' s only a matter of time before ali lowers the boom .
ali swings with his right .
what a beautiful swing .
but the punch lifts frazier clean out of the ring .
frazier' s still risin ' , and the referee wears a frown ...
' cause he can' t start countin ' till frazier comes down .
frazier' s disappeared from view .
the crowd is getting frantic .
but our radar stations picked him up .
he' s somewhere over the atlantic .
now , who would' ve thought when they came to the fight ... they was gonna witness the launchin ' of a black satellite .
but don' t wait for that fight .
it ain' t never gonna happen .
only thing you could do ... is wonder and imagine .
this has been another sports exclusive from abc .
two .
go two .
over to jim mckay ... in bern , switzerland .
how you gonna go from me to jim mckay ?
listen , uh
did your wife leave you yet ?
no , she hasn' t left me yet .
she' s going to , ' cause i told your wife when i seen her ...
i said , " listen , why you doin ' this to yourself ?
oh , man , joe .

only thing he' s champion of is gettin ' knocked down .
george foreman is the heavyweight champion of the world .
the rumble in the jungle .
that is the name that i' ve given it .
muhammad ali and george foreman in kinshasa , zaire .
don , zaire ?
yeah , don .
i mean , why not antarctica , somethin ' like that ?
what' s wrong with new york city ?
because you miss the significance .
see , i dream of overcoming 400 years of racial depression ... to the dawn of a new day of liberation , financial and otherwise .
it will raise up the spirits of our inner cities .
it will rise up and fill with hope , the souls ... the unrequited needs of the black proletariat .
that is , the discouraged , dispirited , denigrated denizens ... of the demimonde that is called the ghetto .
man , don , you crazy .
you must' ve studied the whole " d " section of the dictionary .
good morning , sister .
hi , brother .
how you doin ' , champ ?
why they saying that ?
what they sayin ' ?
what that mean ?
i don' t understand .
it means  what ?
it mean , " ali , kill him .
ali , kill him .
the champ is here !
ladies and gentlemen , the heavyweight champion of the world has arrived !
the champ is here !
hey , man .
he' s quite younger than you .
how you feeling about that ?
he' s quite younger than me ?
well , we quite younger than you .
what you talkin ' about ?
thirty two years old .
best shape of my life .
hey , stop !
all right , back up .
did you see muhammad ali ?
here' s your water .
oh , thank you , hon .
bottled water .
frozen steaks .
brought all that stuffin like africa' s ain' t got no steaks .
you could pick up parasites .
mobutu eats it .
mobutu' s takin ' care of mobutu .
he steals all the wealth and sends it to switzerland .
what that got to do with any of why we here ?
we are here ' cause don king got mobutu to put up $1 0 million .
don king don' t care about africa .
he' s worse than herbert .
here come herbert .
and don king fit right in too .
now he' s a dashiki wearin ' rip off .
don king delivered the first ever ... black promoted championship fight in africa .
don king talks black , lives white and thinks green .
and you' re defending him and brother herbert ?
' cause clean cut muslims in a parade on the south side of chicago ... ain' t gonna get this done !
i got to put honkies with connections and bad ass niggas to it .
and now they matched you up against george foreman .
do you think they give a damn if you get killed ?
so that' s what you think ?
i just wanna know why my muslim husband ... is allowing himself to get strung up on a cross .
just tell me why .
mayum' s sick .
maybe i ought to go back to chicago and look after her ?
sure .
well , then i guess i' il be back before the fight .
if that ? s all right , my husband .
this fight is no contest !
he is entirely too slow to fight me .
i say that george foreman is a mummy .
he' s too slow .
you know i name all my fighters .
i' m gonna call george foreman " the mummy .
he fight like a mummy .
here come the left .
here come the right .
but the mummy can' t hit what the mummy can' t see ...
' cause i' m too fast for him .
i' m too fast .
i' m too fast .
i' m too fast .
i move too good for him .
i' il hit george foreman so many times , he' il think he' s surrounded .
he gonna say , " call the police !
it' s five of ' em in here !
i' m bad , man .
i' m bad !
muhammad , i' m sorry .
i have to ask .
are you really fast enough anymore ... to beat george foreman ?
if he gets you against the ropes , he can knock you out with either hand .
many people believe you ? re not the man you used to be ten years ago .
see , now , howard ...
i didn' t even want to talk about this , man .
especially not out here in front of all these people .
but i talked to your wife ... and she said you not the man you used to be two years ago !
champ .
champ , george had an accident .
he he had what ?
what are you talking about ?
he got cut right above his right eye .
his sparring partner' s elbow split it open .
can he fight ?
not for six weeks .
this is not a humorous situation , my champ .
this postponement could be long , especially if george leaves .
you tying to pull something here , don ?
if george leaves , he ain' t comin ' back .
george don' t like it here .
how right you are , my suspicious and short italian brother .
look here , man , my fiduciary responsibility ... to this first all black promotion ... is analogous to a garden in the african sun it must grow , it must bloom .
cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to the astrodome ... or any dome out of zaire where it be deprivileged of light and bled of water .
' cause what gonna be bleedin ' out of there is money a hemorrhage of cash .
i' m talkin ' about blood on the floor .
double hotel costs , airplane , travel costs , food and beverage .
so what do you want us to do ?
muhammad ali .
the people' s champion .
my black brother .
i need you .
i need your strength .
i need you to find a way to get george to stay .
be moses in reverse .

i heard you .
i been watching you .

hold on a second, joe .
they' re telling me we have a caller .
go ahead , please .
cosell , this is muhammad ali .
it' s muhammad ali .
everybody knows that i am the champ .
the crown is a lie .
i know it' s a lie .
joe frazier knows it' s a lie .
and it' s time for everybody to stop lying and tell the truth .
let' s tell it like it is .
with your court and boxing problems ... can you get a fight promoted ?
i would fightjoe frazier for free in a phone booth ... in the middle oftimes square if i wasn' t broke .
did you say you were broke ?
how can you be broke ?
you made more money than all previous heavyweights champions combined .
what about your management ?
surely they have provided for you .
all i' m trying to say is it' s time for everybody to stop lyin ' .
muhammad ali is the champ .
get my son herbert on the telephone .
muhammad , thank you for calling in .
i' il relay that tojoe .
and telljoe i said he is very ugly .
muhammad says that he will fight you anywhere , anytime ... and that the championship really is his until that battle ensues .
why didn' t you call an ambulance or a doctor ?
because he gave me your number when he checked in .
normally , he' s up there making a lot of noise .
but now he hasn' t answered the door in three days .
what' s that ?
it' s daylight .
get me that short dog .
give it to me .
what' s wrong with you ?
ain' t nothin ' wrong with me .
my head ain' t bad .
leave me alone .
leave you alone .
you called me !
yes , but that was a week ago .
why are you shamin ' yourself ?
let me go , man .
why you doin ' that to yourself ?
why you shamin ' yourself ?
ain' t nobody shamed .
ain' t nothin ' wrong with me .
i' m flyin ' .
the sky chief talk through me .
i know the word .
you know low .
yeah ?
i know low where the king is goin ' back to his throne !
from the root to the fruit !
them rhymes is old , bundini .
you need to get some new ones .
god don' t care about you .
don' t care about me .
in all of everything , we don' t mean nothin ' .
he don' t know us .
we be .
and that' s the onliest thing he did .
but that' s good .
that' s why we free .
but free ain' t easy .
free is real and real is a motherfucker .
it eats raw meat .
it walk in its own shoes .
it don' t ever waiver .
yeah .
l i sold your belt .
i sold your belt to a barber for $500 on lenox avenue .
that' s how low i did you .
i couldn' t help it .
i got a crazy mind .
that belt say you the heavyweight boxing champion of the world ... and i took that $500 ... and i put it in my arm .
that' s what i called to tell you .
i heard about the nation stuff , the courtroom .
what you gonna do ?
take me back .
i could go down there and get the belt .
i can go get the belt .
mr. ali has sporting blood .
mr. ali wants a place in this sports world .
he loves it too much .
i am therefore suspending mr. ali from the practice of islam .
he may no longer appear in temple , pray or teach ...
hey , champ .
$1, 000 to the man that bring me howard cosell' s toupee dead or alive !
don' t bother me .
i' m a world famous sportscaster ... and you' re an ex champion with diminished skills .
i can' t be seen with you .
how' s it goin ' , champ ?
pretty good , man .
muhammad , i' d do anything for you .
you know that .
but i' ve got bosses who only give a damn about nielsen ratings .
i guarantee ... it will be a historical and a momentous night .
if they came to me tomorrow and say , " we want you to fightjoe frazier .
madison square garden .
millions and millions of dollars .
here' s your license back .
i will tell them ...
i will never fight again .
frankly , muhammad , i' m surprised , because unless you or until you fight frazier
cosell , are you losin ' your hearing along with your hair ?
don' t put no question to it , man .
i done told you , i' m through fightin ' .
i got a much bigger contender , a much heavier opponent .
i' m fightin ' the entire us government .
do you think you' re going to jail ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
joe frazier told me on this show that he could knock you out .
see , there you go agitatin ' .
you should' ve asked smokin' joe what have he been smokin ' ?
that boy even dream he whupped me , he better wake up and apologize .
if i was to get in the ring with joe ... here' s what you might see .
ali comes out to meet frazier , but frazier starts to retreat .
lfjoe goes back an inch farther , he' il wind up in a ringside seat .
ali swings with his left , ali swings with his right .
just look at the kid carry the fight .
frazier keeps backin ' , but there' s not enough room .
it' s only a matter of time before ali lowers the boom .
ali swings with his right .
what a beautiful swing .
but the punch lifts frazier clean out of the ring .
frazier' s still risin ' , and the referee wears a frown ...
' cause he can' t start countin ' till frazier comes down .
frazier' s disappeared from view .
the crowd is getting frantic .
but our radar stations picked him up .
he' s somewheres over the atlantic .
now , who would' ve thought when they came to the fight ... they was gonna witness the launchin ' of a black satellite .
but don' t wait for that fight .
it ain' t never gonna happen .
onliest thing you could do ... is wonder and imagine .
this has been another sports exclusive from abc .

i mean , why not antarctica , somethin ' like that ?
what' s wrong with new york city ?
because you miss the significance .
see , i dream of overcoming 400 years of racial depression ... to the dawn of a new day of liberation , financial and otherwise .
it will raise up the spirits of our inner cities .
it will rise up and fill with hope , the souls ... the unrequited needs of the black proletariat .
that is , the discouraged , dispirited , denigrated denizens ... of the demimonde that is called the ghetto .
man , don , you crazy .
you must' ve studied the whole " d " section of the dictionary .
george foreman demolished two of your most difficult opponents .
isn' t it intimidating to you in some way ... to have to face such a reality ?
that' s it with you , cosell .

i' m coming down there .
i' ve had it too .
you' ve had it too ?
man , i' m so sick of you .

i be seein ' you doin ' interviews on your tv show ... and i realize that you don' t know nobody as famous as me .
you don' t know nobody .
nobody wouldn' t know who you was if it wasn' t for me .
i don' t think that' s exactly right .
wouldn' t nobody in this room look at all these cameras .
all these cameras all over the place , people takin ' pictures .
writin ' down everything i say .
and when they look it up and read it in their newspapers ... and they write it down , folks is lookin ' at it ... it' s gonna say , " muhammad ali and some strange white man .

well , we quite younger than you .
what you talkin ' about ?
thirty two years old .
best shape of my life .
hey , stop !
all right , back up .
did you see muhammad ali ?
you facin ' a man who will die before he lets you win .
here' s your water .
oh , thank you , hon .
bottled water .
frozen steaks .
brought all that stuff in like africa' s ain' t got no steaks .
you could pick up parasites .
mobutu eats it .
mobutu' s takin ' care of mobutu .
he steals all the wealth and sends it to switzerland .
what that got to do with any of why we here ?
we are here ' cause don king got mobutu to put up $10 million .
don king don' t care about africa .
he' s worse than herbert .
here come herbert .
and don king fit right in too .
now he' s a dashiki wearin ' rip off .
don king delivered the first ever ... black promoted championship fight in africa .
don king talks black , lives white and thinks green .
and you' re defending him and brother herbert ?
' cause clean cut muslims in a parade on the south side of chicago ... ain' t gonna get this done !
i got to put honkies with connections and bad ass niggas to it .
and now they matched you up against george foreman .
do you think they give a damn if you get killed ?
so that' s what you think ?
i just wanna know why my muslim husband ... is allowing himself to get strung up on a cross .
just tell me why .
maryum' s sick .
maybe i ought to go back to chicago and look after her ?
sure .
well , then i guess i' il be back before the fight .
if that' s all right , my husband .
hey , cosell !
hey , man .
how many of you ugly sportswriters in there got me over foreman ?
tell the truth .
how are you gonna dance against george ?
he' s sparring with a fast middleweight , training to cut you off .
he gets you against the ropes , he can knock you out with either hand .
you know i name all my fighters .
i' m gonna call george foreman " the mummy .
he fight like a mummy .
here come the left .
here come the right .
but the mummy can' t hit what the mummy can' t see ...
' cause i' m too fast for him .
i' m too fast .
i' m too fast .
i' m too fast .
i move too good for him .
i' il hit george foreman so many times , he' il think he' s surrounded .
he gonna say , " call the police !
it' s five of' em in here !
i' m bad , man .
i' m bad !
muhammad , i' m sorry .
i have to ask .
are you really fast enough anymore ?
many people believe you' re not the man you used to be ten years ago .
see , now , howard ...
i didn' t even want to talk about this , man .
especially not out here in front of all these people .
but i talked to your wife ... and she said you not the man you used to be two years ago !
man , don' t tell me i ain' t the man i used to be .
champ .
champ , george had an accident .
he he had what ?
what are you talking about ?
he got cut right above his right eye .
his sparring partner' s elbow split it open .
can he fight ?
not for six weeks .
this is not a humorous situation , my champ .
this postponement could be long , especially if george leaves .
you trying to pull something here , don ?
if george leaves , he ain' t comin ' back .
george don' t like it here .
how right you are , my suspicious and short italian brother .
look here , man , my fiduciary responsibility ... to this first all black promotion ... is analogous to a garden in the african sun it must grow , it must bloom .
cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to the astrodome ... or any dome out of zaire where it be deprivileged of light and bled of water .
' cause what gonna be bleedin ' out of there is money a hemorrhage of cash .
i' m talkin ' about blood on the floor .
double hotel costs , airplane , travel costs , food and beverage .
so what do you want us to do ?
muhammad ali .
the people' s champion .
my black brother .
i need you .
i need your strength .
i need you to find a way to get george to stay .
be moses in reverse .
do not let my people go .
keep them the fuck right here in egypt .
if you' il pardon my swahili .
lingala .
say what ?
they speak lingala .
ali wants his title , and he wants it in zaire .
okay , all right , okay .
let' s take it back .
george go , george go .
hell , i can get you joe frazier .
ali frazier 3 .
that' s the fight everybody want to see .
we don' t want frazier , we want george .
hell , i don' t control george foreman .
there' s been an accidental injury to george foreman in training .
the truth is ...
george knocked hisself out .
that' s right .
he did three rounds , realized he was gonna lose to muhammad ali ... and knocked hisself out .
i predict that when the fight is set , he might not show .
oh , you bad .
that' s right , i' m a bad man .
ain' t no doubt about that .
yeah , but you tell george the same thing .
i heard you .
i been watching you .
i know he' s your man , i know you got him picked , but the man is in trouble .
the whole world was gonna know , but now he ain' t gonna show .
in order to ensure that george is ready , we are thinking of postponing ... from september 24 to october 30 .
what about the concert ?
the concert will go on as planned .
those dates are september 20 , 21
i want all the helicopters guarded , all the private planes , private boats .
i' m serious .
i want the airports
i want president mobutu and all his paratroopers
all you zaireans , y' all be on guard too .
any strange boats creeping away , they might be taking him out .
bus stations .
and bus stations !

watch the bus stations .
the elephant caravans they might be trying to take him out on an elephant .
what' d you say ?
hell , i ain' t talking to you .

don' t you never talk to angie like that again .

you ain' t callin ' nothin ' .
they all know .
all them ladies out there , they know i' m ready .
i see fear in the eyes of his followers .
this was supposed to be the fight that muhammad ali was ended .
supposed to be muhammad was gonna fall .
supposed to be my destruction .

they misjudged .
they got it wrong .

we made a hole in the table leg , and hid the money in there .

we leave the money and the watch on the table .
and we cover it , in full view .
are you stupid ?
the germans will search high and low .
they' il never notice .
that' s the stupidest thing i' ve ever seen .

wladyslaw szpilman .

majorek used to be in the army .

you know how many copies we print of our newspaper ?
five hundred .
you know how many people on average read one copy ?
twenty .
that makes 10, 000 readers .
these will start the uprising .
majorek hides them in his underpants , and leaves them in toilets .

then i' il tell you something funny .
do you all know who i mean by dr. raszeja ?
the surgeon ?
the surgeon .
for some reason don' t ask me why the germans allowed him into the ghetto to perform an operation .
on a jew ?
they allowed a pole to come in to operate on a jew ?
he got a pass .
that' s all i know .
anyway .
he puts the patient to sleep and starts the operation .
he' s just made the first incision when the ss burst in , shoot the patient on the table , then shoot dr. raszeja and everybody else who was there .
isn' t that a laugh ?
the patient didn' t feel a thing , he was anesthetized .
i said nothing bad , henryk .
what' s the matterwith you all ?
huh ?
huh ?
you lost your sense of humor ?
it' s not funny .
you know what' s funny ?
you' re funnywith that ridiculous tie .
what areyou talking about my tie for ?
what does my tie have to do with anything ?
i need this tie for my work .
your work ?
that' s right , i work .
yes .
playing the piano for the parasites in the ghetto .
parasites .
boys .
boys !
they don' t give a damn about people suffering .
you blame me for their apathy .
i do .
i see it every day .
they don' t even notice what' s going on around them .
i blame the americans .
forwhat ? .
for my tie ? .
american jews , and there are lots of' em .
what have they done for us ? .
what do they think they' re doing ? .
people here are dying , haven' t got a bite to eat .
the jewish bankers there should be persuading america to declare war on germany .

i can look after myself .
they were taking you away .

it' s me theywanted , not you .
why do you have to interfere with other people' s business ? .
you' re mad .
that' s your trouble , is you' re mad .
that' s also my business .
hold it .
what' s the matter ?
what' s the matter ?
are you sick ?
hungry .
employment certificate ?
what' s that mean , no employment certificate ?
you have to have an employment certificate ... to work for one of the german firms in the ghetto , otherwise
otherwise , what ? .
you will be deported .
so the rumors are true .
they' re going to resettle us .
send us to labor camps in the east .
and they' re closing the small ghetto .
my god .
wladek ?
wladek ?
i thought you' d be off on tour playing london , paris , new york , chicago .
not this week .
you look terrible .
haveyou heard the rumors ?
they' re going to resettle us in the east .
rumors !
you take it all too much to heart .
what' s the trouble ?
i' ve been trying to get the certificate of employment for my father .
i' ve managed to get one for me and the rest of my family .
but i need another one for my father .
i' ve been to all the firms and shops .
why didn' tyou come to me ?
i didn' t knowyou were in the certificate business .
i' m not , but majorek is .
can you help ?
i have no money .
please , don' t insult us .
can you do something for him ?
be at the schultz workshop tomorrow , 4 : 00 .
see what a wonderful piece of luck you' ve had today ?
that' s the historical imperative in action .
that' s why i always say , look on the bright side .
the bright side .
yes , i know .
how' s your back ?

du .
du .
du .
du .
du .
du .
i' m sorry .
i did my best .
i thought the certificates would save us .
stop it , wladek !
let' s just hope that henryk and halina will be better off .
where will we be going ?
you' re going to work .
you' il be much better off than in this stinking ghetto .
move .
why did i do it ?
why did i do it , huh ?
why did i do it ?
why did i do it ?
why did i do it ?
why did i do it ?
why did i do it ?

i beg you .
i beg you .
don' t you have a drop of water ?
i beg you .
can you hear what i' m saying ?
i' m telling you it' s a disgrace !
i can hear you !
we let them take us to our death like sheep to the slaughter .
not so loud .
why don' t we attack them ?
there' s half a million of us here .
we could break out of the ghetto .
at least we could die honorably , not as a stain on the face of history .
why areyou so sure they' re sending us to our death ?
i' m not sure !
you know why i' m not sure ?
because they didn' t tell me .
they' re gonna wipe us all out .
what do you want me to do ?
do you want me to fight ?
to fight you need organization
he' s right .
what doyou think i can do , fight them with my violin bow ?
the germans will never squander a huge labor force like this .
they' re sendi ng us to a labor camp .
i t' s obvious .
oh , sure !
look at that cripple there .
look at the old people , the children .
they' re gonna work ?
look at you ?
you gonna carry iron girders on your back ?

she' s getting on my nerves .
what did she do , for god' s sake ?
she smothered her baby .
they prepared a hiding place , so , of course , they went there .
but the baby cried just as the police came .
she smothered the cries with her hands .
the baby died .
a policeman heard the death rattle , found where they were hiding .
mama .
what are you reading ?
if you prick us , do we not bleed ?
if you tickle us , do we not laugh ?
if you poison us , do we not die ?
and if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?? '
very appropriate .
yes , that' s why i brought it .

i was pleased to see you .
they' re going to start a final resettlement now .
we know what it means .
we sent someone out zygmunt .
a good man .
his orders were to follow the trains out of warsaw .
he got to sokolow .
a local railway man told him the tracks divided , one branch leading to treblinka .
he said every day freight trains carrying people from warsaw ... branched offto treblinka and returned empty .
no transports offood are everseen on that line .
and civilians ... are forbidden to approach the treblinka station .
they' re exterm i nati ng us .
it won' t take them long .
we' re 60, 000 left out ofhalfa million .
mostly young people .
and this time we' re gonna fight .
we' re in good shape , organized .
we' re prepared .

i was just clearing my throat .
okay .
maybe you' re coming down with something .
ahem .
i' m all right .
it' s just sort of ...
just what ?
just ...
it' s just a waste of time sitting here ... week after week ... wasting time .
i don' t want you ... to waste your time , antwone .
so , what you want me to say ?
it' s not what i want you to say .
it' s what you want to tell me .
maybe you can start by asking me a question .
i don' t know .
get things going .
i can do that .
you said you come from under a rock .
what did you mean by that ?
i don' t know , i ...
it was the first thing to come to my mind .
what do you think it means ?
well , it could mean ... that , uh ... that you feel under pressure ... that , uh ... uh , you feel a weight ... pressing down on you .
that you' re in the dark , that you' re alone .
you said you had no parents .
i had parents .
okay .
ahem .

you know , you ...
what did it feel like ?
rainy days .
rainy days ?
okay .
why is that ?
you know , in cleveland ... it rains .
not all the time ... but , uh , to a kid ... who wants to go out and play ... it seems like it rains every day .

when i was 2 ...
i was placed in the tate foster home .
reverend tate , he was a fire breathing preacher .
he had his own storefront church .
there was only a few members .
there was ms. tate , cousin nadine ... my foster brothers keith ...
keith was half white ...
dwight , and me .
# good god , yeah #
it was church 3 times on sunday ...
bible study on tuesday ...
y. p. w. w. meetings on thursday ... choir rehearsal on friday .
we found out if we caught the holy ghost ... in front of ms. tate ... she' d give us vanilla wafers after church .
so we' d catch it every sunday .
# hallelujah #
# hallelujah #
# hallelujah , hallelujah #
# hallelujah , hallelujah #
# good god #
# come on , church #
# show me #
reverend tate ... he didn' t like dwight at all .
he said he had too much pride .
so he tried to beat it out of him .
sometimes , he would even try to beat him to death .
did he beat you ?
no , sir .
i think he pitied me .
and i liked him for it ... but i was ashamed of him .
what about mrs. tate ?
what about her ?
i don' t know which one of you no good rotten ... hardheaded niggers put your dirty hands on my walls ...
but i bet i' il get the right one .
i took you in ... when your no account mammies threw you away ... and this is the thanks i get ?
tsk .
you ungrateful niggers .
hmph .
now i know i got the right one .
she used to brag about ... beating me unconscious .
hmph .
she' d threaten to do it again .
but she never did .
why do you think she never did ?
uh ... maybe she was scared .
she found a new way to get me , though .
so you like fire , huh ?
no , muh deah , no , muh deah ...
i don' t like fire .
you ... stay ... away from things that don' t belong to you .
you hear me ?
you hear me ? !
yes , yes , muh deah !
you hear me ? !
yes !
dumb nigger .
i tried everything i could ... to get her to like me ... and nothing ever worked .
were you the youngest of the foster children ?
no , dwight was the youngest .
i was in the middle , and keith was the oldest .
ms. tate , she used to put us against each other ... so much , we started hating each other .
but i think deep down inside ... we really hated ourselves .
what do you mean ?
keith was half white .
she would try to compare keith ... to me and dwight .
you know , he had the good hair ... and we had the bad hair .
she used to say how keith was better than us ... because his father was white .
i wished i was keith .
mmhh .
but not even keith could escape ... from being called a nigger .
she hardly used our names .
she said the word nigger so often ... called us niggers so often ... that we could tell ... who she was talking to by ... the way she said the word nigger .
what happened to dwight and keith ?
dwight is in lucasville state penitentiary .
keith got taken back by his mother .
he was raped by one of her boyfriends .
mmhh .
did what happen to keith happen to you ?
hell , no .
okay .
okay .
was mrs. tate ever ...
was she ever nice to you ?
yeah , there were times .
sometimes she would tell her friends that ... we were good kids and that she was proud of us .
chummy times .
chummy times ?
yeah .
i got to where i could tell ... what kind of day it was gonna be ... by the scent in the air when i awoke .
how could you tell ?
well , if i awoke and there was the smell ... of grits and eggs ... or water steaming off the pavement ... as she hosed it down ...
i had to look out all day .
but ... if i smelled pancakes ... everything was okay .
she make pancakes very often ?
no , sir .
i can delay my next appointment ... if you want to talk some more .
no , sir .
hey , slim .
what ?
you going home next leave ?
hell , yeah .
i gotta tend to the flock .
hey , when i get leave ...
i' m gonna be like a ... a vampire ... coming to town with his coffin .
just a place to lay before i get down .
what' s that mean ?
man , shut up .
people trying to sleep .
aw , shut your grouchy ass up .
jesus !
hey , when you going home , pork chop ?
when your mama quit tripping ... and send me my money .
ha ha ha !
what about you , fish ?
when you going home ?
fish ?
fish !
last night ...
i had a dream about jesse .
who' s jesse ?
he was my best friend .
when i wasn' t at home ...
i was probably wherever jesse was for 3 reasons .
one was , being his friend ... he wouldn' t beat me up .
hey , jesse , look !
i got 5 !
and the other reasons were ... so he wouldn' t beat me up .
i only got 3 .
i liked him a whole lot .
give me yours .
we used to drive our friend kenny crazy .
let' s get kenny .
kenny hung around me ... for the same reasons i hung around jesse .
hey , kenny , let me see .
where' s jesse ?
ugh !
aah !
stop , stop !
get ' em off , get ' em off !
hey , kenny , what' s wrong ?
hey , kenny , don' t forget to write !
hey , kenny , don' t forget to write !
ms. tate , she hated jesse .
she hated seeing us together even more .
but for years , she couldn' t keep us apart .
i was so happy when she kicked me out .
twonny .
that hoodlum nigger jesse call up here askin ' for you .
said something about y' all going to the picture show .
now , that' s the devil' s work ... and who told you you could go ... to the picture show , anyhow ?
i mean , where you get the money , nigger ?
did you steal it ?
i already told you .
i' ve been raking lawns .
well , you woulda stole it .
give me the money .
i said gimme the money .
you don' t know what to do with no money no how .
that' s why i never let you have none .
why you always got to make things ... difficult for me ?
difficult ?
difficult .
where you learnin ' such fancy words at ?
fancy ?
ain' t no fancy word .
don' t sassy me , boy .
no one' s sassing you .
don' t sassy me !
ain' t no one sassing you !
don' t you ...
i ain' t gonna let you beat me no more !
no more !
lord jesus .
i want you out of my house .
hmm ?
and who you think gonna take you in , huh ?
retarded nigger , don' t nobody want you .
your damn mammy didn' t even want you .
gimme my shoe .
hmpf !
must' ve felt pretty good ... when you took that shoe from her .
yeah , i felt like i was gonna go ... right upside her head ... but i just chilled .
why' d you chill ?
i don' t know .
well , i' m glad you did .
how' d you feel ?
i felt like i won a prize ... but it scared me .
why ?
it was the first time i ever felt ... more powerful than her .
it was like a surprise .
whatever happened to jesse ?
we lost touch .
you know how it is .
yeah .
it might be helpful to understand the mentality ... of people like the tates .
here .
it' s called the slave community .
why i gotta understand somebody beatin ' on me ?
what you went through ... was in part the result of the treatment ... that slaves received from their masters ... and then passed on to their own children ... generation to generation to generation ... right on down to the tates .
sir , that sounds like an excuse .
i mean , i was a kid .
i understand .
you sound like you takin ' up for ' em .
i' m not saying what they did was right .
what they did was wrong .
we all have choices .
they made the wrong choices .
but this is not about them .
this is about you .
you were sent to me ... because you have an anger problem .
well , you got the right to be angry .
but you also have to learn to channel that anger ... to use it constructively .
instead of gettin ' into fights ... go to the gym .
hit the bag , lift the weights .
you have to use that energy to better yourself .
you say you' re taking japanese classes , right ?
yeah .
okay , you' re already on the right track .
can we talk about this next week ?
3 sessions , son .
unfortunately ... that' s all i' m given to make a recommendation ... and i' m gonna recommend ... that you be given a second chance .
that is what you want , isn' t it ?
to stay in the navy ?
yes , sir .
okay .
okay , stay out of trouble .

you are good ... because you' re honest .
you' re more honest than most people ... even in your anger .
the only thing you' re not honest with yourself ... about is your need to find your own family .
your natural family .
i don' t feel like i need to look for them .
mmm .
it would answer a lot of questions for you .
i don' t have any questions .
you' re upset with them ... because you feel they didn' t come to your rescue .

how could they not have known ?
that' s a question you need to ask them .

my wife and i , we were gonna have a bunch of kids ... when we found out we couldn' t have any .
and it rocked her to the core .
i knew what to do for her , though .
she needed help , treatment .
i made sure she had it .
the best psychiatrist , the one that trained me .
but i ... the well one , the strong one ...
at the same time i went about the business of shutting down .
very subtle , very quiet .
it was my little secret .
until one day , a young man came into my office and into my life ... and he blew up that little secret , right in my face .
and he put me to shame in a way i never thought possible .
because of you , antwone , i' m a better doctor ... and i' m learning to be a better husband .

i thought you said something .
ahem .
i was just clearing my throat .
okay .
maybe you' re coming down with something .
ahem .
i' m all right .
it' s just sort of ...
just what ?
just ...
it' s just a waste of time sitting here ... week after week ... wasting time .
i don' t want you ... to waste your time , antwone .
so , what you want me to say ?
it' s not what i want you to say .
it' s what you want to tell me .
maybe you can start by asking me a question .
i don' t know .
get things going .
i can do that .
you said you come from under a rock .
what did you mean by that ?
i don' t know , i ...
it was the first thing to come to my mind .
what do you think it means ?
well , it could mean ... that , uh ... that you feel under pressure ... that , uh ... uh , you feel a weight ... pressing down on you .
that you' re in the dark , that you' re alone .
you said you had no parents .
i had parents .
okay .
ahem .

2 years .
how does that make you feel , antwone ?
i don' t know .
come on , you must have some feelings about it .
you know , you what did it feel like ?
rainy days .
rainy days ?
okay .
why is that ?
you know , in cleveland ... it rains .
not all the time ... but , uh , to a kid ... who wants to go out and play ... it seems like it rains every day .
but , uh ... kids expect it to rain sometimes ... but ... for one kid ... it rained too much .
hmm .

when i was 2 ...
i was placed in the tate foster home .
reverend tate , he was a fire breathing preacher .
he had his own storefront church .
there was only a few members .
there was ms. tate , cousin nadine ... my foster brothers keith
keith was half white
dwight , and me .
# good god , yeah #
it was church 3 times on sunday ...
bible study on tuesday ...
y. p. w. w. meetings on thursday ... choir rehearsal on friday .
we found out if we caught the holy ghost ... in front of ms. tate ... she' d give us vanilla wafers after church .
so we' d catch it every sunday .
# hallelujah #
# hallelujah #
# hallelujah , hallelujah #
# hallelujah , hallelujah #
# good god #
# come on , church #
# show me #
reverend tate ... he didn' t like dwight at all .
he said he had too much pride .
so he tried to beat it out of him .
sometimes , he would even try to beat him to death .
did he beat you ?
no , sir .
i think he pitied me .
and i liked him for it ... but i was ashamed of him .
what about mrs. tate ?
what about her ?
i don' t know which one of you no good rotten ... hardheaded niggers put your dirty hands on my walls ...
but i bet i' il get the right one .
i took you in ... when your no account mammies threw you away ... and this is the thanks i get ?
tsk .
you ungrateful niggers .
hmph .
now i know i got the right one .
she used to brag about ... beating me unconscious .
hmph .
she' d threaten to do it again .
but she never did .
why do you think she never did ?
uh ... maybe she was scared .
she found a new way to get me , though .
so you like fire , huh ?
no , muh deah , no , muh deah ...
i don' t like fire .
you ... stay ... away from things that don' t belong to you .
you hear me ?
you hear me ? !
yes , yes , muh deah !
you hear me ? !
yes !
dumb nigger .
i tried everything i could ... to get her to like me ... and nothing ever worked .
were you the youngest of the foster children ?
no , dwight was the youngest .
i was in the middle , and keith was the oldest .
ms. tate , she used to put us against each other ... so much , we started hating each other .
but i think deep down inside ... we really hated ourselves .
what do you mean ?
keith was half white .
she would try to compare keith ... to me and dwight .
you know , he had the good hair ... and we had the bad hair .
she used to say how keith was better than us ... because his father was white .
i wished i was keith .
mmhh .
but not even keith could escape ... from being called a nigger .
she hardly used our names .
she said the word nigger so often ... called us niggers so often ... that we could tell ... who she was talking to by ... the way she said the word nigger .
what happened to dwight and keith ?
dwight is in lucasville state penitentiary .
keith got taken back by his mother .
he was raped by one of her boyfriends .
mmhh .
did what happen to keith happen to you ?
hell , no .
okay .
okay .
was mrs. tate ever
was she ever nice to you ?
yeah , there were times .
sometimes she would tell her friends that ... we were good kids and that she was proud of us .
chummy times .
chummy times ?
yeah .
i got to where i could tell ... what kind of day it was gonna be ... by the scent in the air when i awoke .
how could you tell ?
well , if i awoke and there was the smell ... of grits and eggs ... or water steaming off the pavement ... as she hosed it down ...
i had to look out all day .
but ... if i smelled pancakes ... everything was okay .
she make pancakes very often ?
no , sir .
i can delay my next appointment ... if you want to talk some more .
no , sir .
hey , slim .
what ?
you going home next leave ?
hell , yeah .
i gotta tend to the flock .
hey , when i get leave ...
i' m gonna be like a a vampire ... coming to town with his coffin .
just a place to lay before i get down .
what' s that mean ?
man , shut up .
people trying to sleep .
aw , shut your grouchy ass up . jesus !
hey , when you going home , pork chop ?
when your mama quit tripping ... and send me my money .
ha ha ha !
what about you , fish ?
when you going home ?
fish ?
fish !
last night ...
i had a dream aboutjesse .
who' s jesse ?
he was my best friend .
when i wasn' t at home ...
i was probably wherever jesse was for 3 reasons .
one was , being his friend ... he wouldn' t beat me up .
hey, jesse , look !
i got 5 !
and the other reasons were so he wouldn' t beat me up .
i only got 3 .
i liked him a whole lot .
give me yours .
we used to drive our friend kenny crazy .
let' s get kenny .
kenny hung around me ... for the same reasons i hung around jesse .
hey , kenny , let me see .
where' s jesse ?
ugh !
aah !
stop , stop !
get ' em off , get ' em off ! .
hey , kenny , what' s wrong ?
hey , kenny , don' t forget to write !
hey , kenny , don' t forget to write !
ms. tate , she hated jesse .
she hated seeing us together even more .
but for years , she couldn' t keep us apart .
i was so happy when she kicked me out .
twonny .
that hoodlum niggerjesse call up here askin ' for you .
479 ]
said something about y' all going to the picture show .
now , that' s the devil' s work ... and who told you you could go ... to the picture show , anyhow ?
i mean , where you get the money , nigger ?
did you steal it ?
i already told you .
i' ve been raking lawns .
well , you woulda stole it .
give me the money .
i said gimme the money .
you don' t know what to do with no money nohow .
that' s why i never let you have none .
why you always got to make things ... difficult for me ?
difficult ?
difficult .
where you learnin ' such fancy words at ?
fancy ?

lord jesus .

retarded nigger , don' t nobody want you .
your damn mammy didn' t even want you .
gimme my shoe .
hmpf ! .

yeah , i felt like i was gonna go ... right upside her head ... but i just chilled .
why' d you chill ?
i don' t know .
well , i' m glad you did .
how' d you feel ?
i felt like i won a prize ... but it scared me .
why ?
it was the first time i ever felt ... more powerful than her .
it was like a surprise .
whatever happened tojesse ?
we lost touch .
you know how it is .
yeah .
it might be helpful to understand the mentality ... of people like the tates .
here .
it' s called the slave community .
why i gotta understand somebody beatin ' on me ?
what you went through ... was in part the result of the treatment ... that slaves received from their masters ... and then passed on to their own children ... generation to generation to generation ... right on down to the tates .
sir , that sounds like an excuse .
i mean , i was a kid .
i understand .
you sound like you takin ' up for ' em .
i' m not saying what they did was right .
what they did was wrong .
we all have choices .
they made the wrong choices .
but this is not about them .
this is about you .
you were sent to me ... because you have an anger problem .
well , you got the right to be angry .
but you also have to learn to channel that anger ... to use it constructively .
instead of gettin ' into fights ... go to the gym .
hit the bag , lift the weights .
you have to use that energy to better yourself .
you say you' re taking japanese classes , right ?
yeah .
okay , you' re already on the right track .
can we talk about this next week ?
3 sessions , son .
unfortunately ... that' s all i' m given to make a recommendation ... and i' m gonna recommend ... that you be given a second chance .

okay .
okay , stay out of trouble .

you are good ... because you' re honest .
you' re more honest than most people ... even in your anger .
the only thing you' re not honest with yourself ... about is your need to find your own family .
your natural family .
i don' t feel like i need to look for them .
mmm .
it would answer a lot of questions for you .
i don' t have any questions .
you' re upset with them ... because you feel they didn' t come to your rescue .

mr. and mrs. abagnale this is not a question of your son' s attendance .
i regret to inform you that , for the past week
frank has been teaching mrs. glasser' s french class .
he what ?
your son has been pretending to be a substitute teacher
lecturing the students , uh , giving out homework .
mrs. glasser has been ill and there was some confusion with the real sub .
your son held a teacher parent conference yesterday and was planning a class field trip to a french bread factory in trenton .
do you see the problem we have ?
mrs. davenport ?
yeah .
uh , i have a note to miss fifth and sixth period today .
doctor' s appointment .
one moment .
i' il be right with you .
hey ...
yes ?
you should fold it .

that note .
it' s a fake , right ?
you should fold it .
it' s ...
it' s a note from my mom .
i have a doctor' s appointment .
yeah , but there' s no crease in the paper .
when your mom hands you a note to miss school the first thing you do is , you fold it and you put it in your pocket .
i mean , if it' s real , where' s the crease ?
frankie .
ma , i' m home .
oh , you remember that girl joanna
i was telling you about ?
i asked her out today .
think we' re going to go to the junior prom .
ma , is this my driver' s license ?
that' s all there is , two bedrooms .
oh , frankie .
you remember dad' s friend ?
jack barnes ?
from the club .
hello .
he came by looking for your father .
i was giving him a tour of the apartment .
it' s very , uh , uh , spacious , paula .
dad' s at the store . so , frank ... you' re getting to look more like your old man every day .
thanks for the sandwich , paula .
i' il see you later , eh ?

oh .
well , thanks , frank .
uh , that' s the president' s pin .
i' d be in deep trouble if i lost that .
i' il see you all later , eh ?
are you hungry , frankie ?
i' il make you a sandwich .
jack wanted to talk business with your father .
he thinks we should get a lawyer and sue the government .
that is not legal , what they' re doing to us .
why aren' t you saying anything ?
you' re not going to tell him ... are you ?
no .
that' s right .
there' s nothing to tell .
i' m going out for a few hours to visit some old friends from the tennis club and ... when i get home , we' il all have dinner together .
right ?
but you won' t say anything because it' s ... it' s just silly , isn' t it ?
how could we sue anybody ?
oh ... do you need some money , frankie ?
a few dollars to buy some record albums ?
here , take five dollars .
or or ten .
you promised you were going to quit .
ma , i' m home !
hey , hey !

you stay away from me ...
i don' t know who you are but if you ever come back here again ...
frankie !
frank , frank , calm down , will you ?
i' m dick kesner .
now , i want you to leave your things here and follow me into the next room , okay ?
they' re all waiting for you .
you don' t have to be scared .
i' m right here , frank .
i' il always be here .
but there are laws .
everything in this country has to be legal . so what we need to do is make some decisions .
that' s what mr. kesner is here for .
many times these decisions are left up to the courts but that can be very expensive , frank people fighting over their children .
nobody is fighting .
look at me , frank .
nobody is fighting .
dad , what' s going on ?
dad , what' s going on ?
do you remember your grandma , eve ? she arrived this morning .
hello .
do you understand what we' re saying to you , frank ?
your father and i are getting a divorce .
nothing' s gonna change .
we' re still gonna see each other . stop it , please , frank .
don' t interrupt .
frank , you don' t have to read all of this .
most of it' s for your parents ... boring adult business ... but this paragraph right here , this is important because it states who you' re gonna live with ... after the divorce ... whose custody you will be in .
and there' s a blank space right here .
and i want you to go into the kitchen sit at the table and put a name down .
you can take as long as you want but when you come back into this room ...
i want to see a name on that line .
frank , just write down a name and this will all be over .
it' s gonna be okay .
dad , what name ?
your mother or your father .
just put the name there .
it' s as simple as that .
and don' t look so scared .
it' s not a test .
there' s no wrong answer .
hi .

that' il be $3 . 50 , sir .
is it okay if i write you a check ?
carl , when do i get to call my father ?
you can call him when we get to new york .

i' il tell mr. rosen you' re coming .

aloha , frank .

hello .
enjoying your free ride ?
marci ... did you drop this ?
must' ve slipped right off your neck .
no ...
no !
no ...
yes , yes , yes , yes !
yes !
why are you stopping ?
i want to tell you something , marci .
this is by far ... the best date i have ever been on .
i' d like to open a money market , please .
okay .
welcome to miami mutual bank .
how may i help you ?
my name is frank taylor .
i' m a copilot for pan am .
i' d like to cash this check here , and then
i' d like to take you out for a steak dinner .
and then we feed the checks into the mlcr machine which uses special ink to encode the account numbers on the bottom of the checks .
and where are these numbers ?
they' re , um ... right here .
right there ? see ?
they' re called routing numbers . so where do the checks get routed to ?
you know , i don' t exactly know .
nobody ever asked me that before .
our next item up for bid is also from the jersey central bank foreclosure .
this is a mlcr encoder a machine used to encode bank checks .
do i have an opening bid ?
our unknown subject is a paperhanger who started working on the east coast .
in the last few weeks , this unsub has developed a new form of check fraud which i' m calling " the float .
what he' s doing is he' s opening checking accounts at various banks then changing the mlcr ink routing numbers at the bottom of those checks .
next slide , please .
next slide , please .
uh , the remote thing is broken .
you' il have to do it by hand .
you' ve gotta ... try the ...
agent mullen , it should be ... it should be the square button just there by the side .
this carousel doesn' t work .
it' s a bad carousel you got there .
thank you , agent mullen .
got to move it manually .
this is a map of the 12 banks of the u. s .
federal reserve . slide .
mlcr scanners at every bank read these numbers at the bottom of a check ... slide ... and then , ship that check off to its corresponding branch .
carl , for those of us who are unfamiliar with bank fraud you mind telling us what the hell you' re talking about ?
the east coast branches are numbered zero one to zero six .
the central branch is zero seven , zero eight so on , so forth .
you mean those numbers on the bottom of a check actually mean something ?
all of this was in the report i filed two days ago .
if you change ... a zero two to a one two that means that check , which was cashed in new york does not go to the new york federal branch but it is rerouted all the way to the san francisco federal branch .
the bank doesn' t even know the check has bounced for two weeks which means our unsub can stay in one place paper the same city over and over again while his checks circle the country .
you know , you want to talk to my wife . she' s the one balances the checkbook at our house .
next slide .
daddy !
my son , the birdman . some uniform , frank .
what do you think ?
nice . sit down .
so , dad ...
daddy , have you gotten the postcards ?
of course .
this fork is ice cold .
no , no , dad , th that' s a chilled salad fork .
it' s a fancy restaurant , you know .
well , here ...
i i got you something .
what' s that ?
open it .
you know what those are , right ?
those are the keys to a 1965 cadillac deville convertible .
brand new , dad .
red with white interior split seats , air conditioning , the works .
are you giving me a cadillac ?
yeah .
i' m giving you a cadillac .
dad , sh she' s parked downstairs .
when we' re done eating lunch why don' t you , you know , drive on over to mom' s house pick her up , take a little joyride ?
do you know what would happen if the irs found out
i was driving around in a new coupe ?
i took the train here , frank .
i' m taking the train home .
all right .
i have plenty of money .
you know , if you ever , ever need anything ...
you worried ?
about me ?
no , i' m not ...
i' m not worried .
you think i can' t buy my own car ?
two mice fell in a bucket of cream , frank .
which one am i ?
you' re that second mouse .
i went by the store today .
i had to close the store for awhile .
it' s all about timing , frank .
the goddamn government knows that .
they hit you when you' re down .
i wasn' t going to let them take it from me , so i just ... shut the doors myself , called their bluff .
sooner or later , they' il forget about me .
i understand , i ...
have you told ma ?
she' s so stubborn , your mother .
don' t worry .
i' m not going to let her go without a fight .
i been fighting for us ...
dad ?
... since the day we ... we met .
daddy , out of all those men you were the one that took her home , remember that .
200 men , sitting in that tiny social hall watching her dance .
what was the name of that town ?
montrichard , dad .
yeah .
i didn' t speak a word of french and six weeks later , she was my wi ... she' s your wife .
my son bought me a cadillac today .
i think that calls for a toast .
to the best damn pilot in the sky .
it' s not what you think .
i' m just a copilot .
you see these people staring at you ?
these are the most powerful people in new york city and they keep peeking over their shoulders wondering where you' re going tonight .

okay , i' m screaming out , " fbl , freeze !
and i' m reaching for my gun , but i can' t find it in the bra .
it' s so damn big
i thought i was going to shoot my tits off .
you know , that' s a funny story .
people always laugh at that story .
let me ask you a question , mr. amdursky .
if you were having so much fun undercover why did you transfer to bank fraud ?
i didn' t transfer .
i was censured and reassigned .
it' s like being punished .
i was punished .
i screwed up in the field .
what about you , mr. fox ?
were you ... punished for screwing up in the field ?
oh , no , no , no , i' ve never worked in the field before .
i audited background investigations of department of justice clerical applicants .
well , that' s just great .

i read the report . six feet tall , brown hair , 27 to 30 years of age 160 pounds .
this could be almost anybody .
i heard his voice , sean , i saw his face .
there' s nothing for him to hide behind anymore .
just be careful .
you got 12 years in .
nobody bothers you down on the first floor .
you practically wrote the book on bank fraud .
that' s the kind of thing that can make you section chief someday .
just don' t put yourself in this type of position .
what type of position ?
position of being humiliated .
sean , would you like to hear me tell a joke ?
yeah , sure .
knock , knock !
so , my my next question is , when a pilot retires uh , pan am sends them a check every single month ?
uh , yeah , pension program sends a check and benefits .
how much is that check for ?

this skywayman' s driving me crazy .
who' s the skywayman ?
ah , some nut that' s flying around the country posing as a pan am pilot .

it will be exactly equal .
unless this year ... dad will not be .

fondness , it is necessary to forget it .
the response is not : truth ?
the response is that things exist out of our with

both love me , and this has not anything in common with me .
did he say it to you ?
i am 9 years old .
i see television great .
did it go away for my fault ?
not .
surely not .
it already knew it .
it was for buzz and megan .
it was not for anybody especially , not for a specific problem .
then : what was ?
it is not easy to explain .
but , sometimes , when ... the partners take time married , they stagnate in the routine .
do you know what is the routine ?
yes .
yes , when the people do not amuse herself ... and it is very boring .
yes , something like that .
are you already going to go down ?
when you are ready .
brave . !
a moment .

apace , you have to see this !
you always fall down in the pitfall .
sultame , face of grain !
tarado .
when are you going to learn ?
leave his brother .
you should be testing : not ?
how will you go to the center for young people ?
the mom of ashley will happen for me .

not .
i said already to you .
you are going to take care of kevin .
allow it to go .
i will remain alone .

you ruined me the night .
but if i am going to suffer , you also .
mom !
hello .

it did not know that you would come .
i wanted to give them the surprise .
hello , dad .
hello , buzz .
oh , kate .
golly , the house shines very pretty .
what nice adornments .
like every year .
y ... why did you come this night , dad ?
in fact , i want to speak with his mom .
privately .
do you believe that it wants to return to house ?
sigh , kev .
what ?
not at all of " hello , how is " ?
pardon .
i have a business appointment .
what do you want ?
good .
he was not thinking to go directly to the grain , but ...
you already know that natalie and i we live united , and ... when they pronounce the sentence of divorce , i go away to marry her .
ah , yes ?
you go away to marry again .
golly .
it is ...
it is ...
golly .
only we go eight separated months .
yes , i ...
it happened suddenly , and ...
listening , kate ...
i want that the children are with me during the holidays .
do you love the children for christmas ?
for a pair of days .
i want that they know better natalie .
skylight , since it is going to be his stepmother .
so , you will have to ask them .
i already know it .
and how will i see my friends ?
it is only a pair of days .
yes , the sufficient time i still have out of the move .
you cannot hope that we should resign to our vacation .
and you , kevin ?
the real family will come from visit .
they have a son of your age .
probably be able to play with the crown prince .
the crown prince ?
would not it be brilliant ?
yes , super brilliant .
and they do not imagine the room ... that natalie prepared for them .
what do they say ?
i believe that i happen .
to stop would not be well to the family in christmas .
surely , you understand .
yes .
yes i understand .
good , it stays ... it remains open the invitation : eh ?
i will not return late .
since you are in house , you might do your duties .
yes , lady .
i will make sure that should be carried out .
clean it , face of cheese .
pardon .
it was my fault .
hello , already i came .
hello .
how did you spend it ?
terrible .
i hate buzz .
i do not want to remain again only with him never .
sigh , my love .
i know that it is hard with you .
do i last with me ?
it humiliates me , tortures me .
i am fed up with being the mockery of all .
yes .
it is the youngest difficult being .
i hate buzz .
i hope it did not have neither brothers nor sisters .
you do not say it seriously .
skylight that yes !
i would like to be the only son !
lamentation that you are so unhappy .
go to your quarter to think in what you have ... instead of in what you do not have .
the only children do not know it lucky that are .
the life would be perfect if buzz and megan did not exist .
frankly : it is too much to ask a family that loves me ?
it would be capable of escaping of the house .
if it knew to where going .
but yes i know !
i have an open invitation .
i cannot unbutton the belt .
thank you , alan .
thank you .
sigh , what so incredible party .
and also it gave good fruits .
we assembled more than two millions for the infantile charity .
to open door .
and i am on the verge of obtaining two of the best clients of chicago .
because you are the best publicist of the world .
to close doors .
i already gave to you thank you for saying it it to all ?
to ignite chimney .
not , this night not .
it should demonstrate you my gratitude .
to ignite music .
to close curtains .
sigh , crikey .
i joust when the things they were starting putting oneself well .
what pretty house : not , bonbon ?
yes , marv .
is it sure that you do not want to steal it ?
not .
not , i want to steal it .
my days of thief stayed behind .
fondness , now we will go after the great booty .
easy money .
without intermediaries .
pure profit .
it will be an operation with many class .
three words , edge . ... cues ... tro .
i believe that it is the only one word .
we will hope that it should come the real family ... and then we are going to kidnap to the prince . " sigh , do not kidnap me .
i am very elegant " .
insurance of which we will achieve it ?
now when harry will not design the plan .
but time is not .
because this time , i am the chief .
who is the chief ?
you are the chief .
i am charmed with being married .
this is my girl .
hear me !
oh !
it seems that they have visits .
is this the correct domicile ?
yes , this is the house .
thank you very much .
remain with the change .
they are only coins .
who are you ?
forgive , lady .
yes , prescott ?
mr. mccallister has visits .
the young man affirms that he is his son .
so , that happens .
kevin !
dad !
hello !
i believed that you had said that you would not come .
i started thinking that it was not just that mom had all for christmas .
what is the christmas without children ?
not at all .
hello , kevin .
hello , natalie .
i hope that it should not bother you that falls down to them this way ... but my dad invited me .
yes , already i know it .
does it continue in foot the invitation ?
surely yes .
molly : do you come , please ?
it had many desires of coexisting with you .
your dad speaks very much about you .
buzz is the troublemaker .
i am the magician .
this is kevin mccallister .
it will remain with us a few days .
you prepare the room for special visits ?
ah , that of special visits .
right now , lady .
prescott , give to kevin a key .
if you say it , lady .

golly !
i believe that it is going to like me to be here .
forward .

golly !
thank you , natalie !
why do you have to go out ?
already almost it is a christmas .
yes , but the real family comes to a work of natalie' s charity ... and it corresponds to me to assure me of the coverage ... of the press and the photographers .
i will not be late very much ... and i will not have to work the rest of your vacation .
if you need something , ask prescott for it i will attend to you .
it is a fantastic plane : not ?
i believe that he wants to buy my affection .
what ?
i do not say that i am slightly bad .
it makes me happy that you are here .
mr. prescott , can i rise to him a question ?
yes .
can it do batters ?
does it have chocolate ?
what raisin ?
natalie said that what i needed .
and do you need a batter ?
of chocolate .
does he believe that it will be a white christmas ?
it is very slightly probable ... judging by the recent ones hot temperatures .
what is this ?
a mini elevator ?
it is called montaplatos .
why is it called this way ?
because it transports the plates .
and can the plates mount ?
the plates do not speak ... they do not even do innumerable idiotic questions .
prohi bi do the step
cannot you read ?
the door . " prohibited the step " .
was it referring to me ?
especially to you .
this is the center of control from where i administer the whole house ... and also they are my rooms .
miss .
natalie said to you that you are in your house ... but this are my domains and they remain strictly prohibited .
is it clear ?
some another question ?
very well .

he waits .
insurance of which it is not dangerous ?
bonbon : it would take you if it was dangerous ?
the prince does not come up to tomorrow ... why are we going to enter now ?
to recognize the area .
what did you believe , will it see ?
that we were going to enter this way nothing more for the children ? " all , rise to the van " .
not .
we have to plan where , when and how to extract it hence .
you know the secret of the criminal success ?
that do not catch you .
to glide .
to be prepared .
the preparation .
to be prepared .
to perpetrate with preparation .
eh ?
this is my motto , and that' s why i am ...
an exploratory child .

i believe that there is someone here .
is there anybody here ?

probably the prince came earlier .

yes .
i believe that we recognized already the area .
i will return !
vmonos !
i go already !
house , clean you misma .
good , at least i tried it .
good , probably do not get angry too much .
as soon as i explained to them what happened , probably do not bother very much .
or probably not .
what ...
what ...
what ...
i know that it seems very bad , but ...
my love : what ...
kevin : what ... what ... what have you done ?
it does not work .
i already tried it .
yes , lady ?
they see here at once !
it was not working .
what happened , kevin ?
i was not .
they were the thieves .
the thieves ?
yes .
i recognized the guy .
marv .
did i already tell them of him ?
this is another history .
the thing is that they were going to steal your house .
and did you prefer destroying her ?
not .
it wanted to protect her .
to destroy her ?
for all ...
hear : why did not it come when did i call him ?
does any thief dress hereabouts ?
thief ?
not , lad . all the alarms they were burning .
probably they extinguished them .
they were bringing one of these .
i did not see intruders , and except for ... forgive , lady ... a brief trip to the bath , i did not lose of sight the monitors .
how did a child can do so much damage in the time that took me ...
i cannot understand it .
i was not !
here there was nobody any more .
lie !
i do not lie !
yes lie !
i do not lie !
skylight that yes !
with all respect , gentleman ...
i saw the young man kevin to play with the devices ... as if the house was a great toy .
the vandal only one here he is his son .
allow us .
sit down , kevin .
dad ...
what is happening ?
the thieves got .
kevin , i can excuse you any thing fewer lies .
ah , then , you would not get angry if it had destroyed the house ... any time it was admitting that i did it ... though it has not done it .
good , already i thought it well , and ...
i understand that this is an adjustment difficult for you .
it is natural that you behave yourself badly .
you need attention .
i do not need it .
kevin !
in end ...
in end , what so much damage is ?
i have the insured house .
do you have anything that to say ?
thank you .
and ?
pardon for the damages to your house .
the safety cameras have to of having recorded everything .
what ?
prescott extinguished the cameras .
it is incredible .
it is not to believe itself !
i cannot believe it !
he is this terrible child again .
in all the places to where i begin to steal !
it is as if he me was chasing .
please , marv .
he is only a child .
yes , but i have scars thanks to small that one ...
forget it .
this time , it will not ruin me .
this time everything will go out to asking of mouth .
because in this occasion ...
i have an accomplice in .
hear , please !
look at the way !
for safety .
what bundles here ?
say to me .
i ...
i ...
not at all .
i swear it .
the devices seem to me to be brilliant and i wanted to see them .
one does not come without invitation to house of nobody ... it does not even touch his things .
i did not warn you what would happen if he was finding you here ?
not specifically .
he trusts in me .
it will not be agreeable .
what do you want ?
i was thinking about hearing the voice of the child .
ah !
and i was not wrong .
i do not want that it bothers you more , i will take it from you of above .
we go , kevin .
from now on , i will become a person in charge for him .
thank you for rescuing me , molly .
the best thing with prescott it is to move away from him .
i realized already .
i is one of the villains ... of that they got to the house .
though , technically , they entered with his own remote control .
who do you believe that it gave it to him ?
prescott ?
it seems to me to be a bit crazy .
yes .
surely you think that i have a loose imagination .
the majority of the people thinks it .
but you have to believe me .
kevin , prescott is a solitary man .
this work is the only thing that it has .
here between us , i will say to you that detests his work .
but what you insinuate ...
it is very logical .
he detests his work , and for the same thing , he plans the armed robbery to be able to resign .
i do not believe it .
he listens .
he said to my dad that i lied and it was not true .
i extinguished the safety cameras .
only there is a conclusion .
which ?
marv and his new friend ... they have an accomplice ...
prescott .
i believe that you are right .
seriously ?
yes .
yes you have a loose imagination .
but this is what i adore of the children .
my son was like you to your age ... very naughty .
surely , you were an excellent mom , molly .
it tries to support your imagination under control : yes ?
you have been very comprehensive with the events .
kevin is happening for a difficult stage .
it is not easy when the dads they divorce .
believe me , i know it well .
we will overcome it .
you are going to be an excellent stepmother .
we have to find the form of making it feel in his house .
probably to do the things of christmas that it is usual for us to do , to adorn the tree .
do you himself adorn it ?
yes , skylight .
it is entertaining .
we are going to do it .
we are going to put the tree .
it will fill us with the spirit of the epoch , it will join us as family .
nothing of friends , nothing of diversion , nothing of snow .
undoubtedly , this one is going to be the worst christmas of my life .
hello , kev .
how are you ?
how is if we forget of today and do we begin again ?
do you say it seriously ?
yes .
natalie is an excellent person .
you have to know her more .
i believe that it is time of starting amusing oneself .
i would like it .
yes ?
do we adorn the tree ?
right now ?
insurance .
why not ?
i do not hear you .
can you lower him to the music ?
to extinguish music .
what were you saying ?
skylight , there we will be .
we would not get lost it .
now i call you .
evangelist is in the city .
margaret organized a dinner improvised ... but we should not go : truth ?
why do not you go without me ?
kevin and i will finish with this .
seriously ?
would not it bother you ?
not .
of any form , they are your friends .
you are an angel .
i will not return late to house .
in what were we ?
you do not have to remain for me .
i want to remain .
seriously .
say to me : does natalie go out every night ?
almost all .
his life is very exciting ... the one much more of that we know .
you would say that you are not stagnant in the routine ?
not , i am not stagnant .
why ?
i thought that probably because of it you had left .
kevin .
kevin , you know ...
i did not leave your mom to be with natalie : is it clear ?
this happened later .
do you want to tell me ?
the relations of the adults they are complicated .
sometimes , when the partner marries very young , as your mom and me ... one ends up by feeling that ...
it was necessary to you to live through some things .
yes .
only because you grow externally ... it does not mean that you want to stop of amusing yourself .
i know everything about the internal child , dad .
ah .
yes do you know ?
the old men have sports cars .
surely , you are right .
the bad of the sports cars the fact is that there is no space for anybody any more .
probably for a person .
but if you want to do a trip indeed ... with baggage and quite , there is no space for a friend .
they are brilliant and fast ... but : who wants to go in a nice car if it goes completely only ?
i believe that it seems already perfect .
only it needs to place the star .
kevin always places the star .
you are right .
i places it .
i always raise it and then i pull the trousers .
it does a scandal .
we all laugh .
i suppose that we will have to use the stairs this year .
good , dad , you can already lower me .
go .
it illuminates enough good .
it seems to me that it seems magnificent .
i believe that it is the best tree that we have adorned .
happy christmas , mom .
happy christmas .
happy christmas .
oh . !
it looks at it . !
i did that they were installing to him his mom a chip of computer .
we will do that i prepared us the breakfast .
good morning .
good morning .
good morning , sleepy heads .
to the end they woke up .
what did you do to him to our tree ?
sigh , it was my fault .
the decorators come every year .
with so many emotion , i forgot to cancel the appointment .
are you going to excuse me any day ?
did you remove our tree ?
sooner or later , it would have had to remove it .
they see , kev .
it looks at how many gifts .
he waits .
here there is the big one .
i believe that it has ...
yes , it has your name .
it walks .
open it .
it is on behalf of natalie and mine .
it would not be better than it it was opening tomorrow , in christmas ?
tomorrow you will have many to open .
it walks .
one does not damage .
it walks .
the device super spy to hear .
is not it brilliant ?
yes .
thank you , dad .
thank you , natalie .
good what that you like .
adnde do you go , mom ?
to taking a few things to kevin .
adnde do you go , mom ?
it does not have clean clothes ... and surely it has no toys neither .
it is going to see the fiance of dad .
do you want to go ?
to his orders ?
go !
i come for kevin mccallister .
golly !
buzz .
does it come to take it to him to house ?
not , i brought to him something .
pass for here .
you should be able to hear it .
how do you hear me ?
children , do not separate .
mom !
hello !
yes they remember natalie , truth ?
buzz , megan .
hello , natalie .
ah , and kate , this is natalie .
do they go away to stay ?
not , i brought to you your things .
they have to see this house .
does it can , natalie ?
certainly .
forward .
what a more fantastic tree !
it was better .
what rides in the head ?
a device of spying that gave me natalie before christmas .
seriously ?
nice what of your part .
i have fondness great to your children .
i have to show them the plane that gave me .
do you please a coffee ?
not , thank you .
it did not know that it had so many toys .
sigh , god .
give me it .
i believed that he might not sleep without him .
i cannot believe that has not asked for him .
we can buy him another animal of plush .
this one is called teddy .
teddy is his toy for the transition .
yes .
toy for the transition .
it is something very special that the child ride i obtain to all sides .
you must have one extra , for if something happens to him .
only we had one : do you remember ?
sigh !
how to forget it ?
we were going in the car for the highway , we were taking hurry .
it happened to kevin that teddy wanted fresh air .
so it opened the window , and teddy went out flying .
it became hysterical .
it was not stopping crying .
it was ...
sigh , not ...
peter was parked , i bent to gathering the toy bear .
still i cannot believe that you did it .
it was the rail of low speed and there were few cars .
i do not know what the child would have done if it had lost it .
kevin goes away to entertain so much with the prince ... that is not going to strange to the animal of plush .
it will be wonderful to have the house children' s flood .
i die already for seeing them .
children , care with the sculpture !
good , it will be ... better than me go .
before they break something .
we go to the airport for the real family .
they already know the important thing that is .
those of the catering they are already not late in coming .
the guests will come an hour earlier of that you .
and the nobles ...
do his triumphal entry .
it does not worry .
everything will be in order .
i want that everything goes out well .
we go or we will come late .
i do not want that anything goes out badly .
to open door .
and nothing will go out badly .
ah , what good .
to the end they come .
mr. prescott !
they are they !
watch silenced .
i will extract it of here .
thank you .
they are the thieves !
they are the thieves !
mr. prescott !
it is marv !
but skylight , you already knew it .
hear me well .
i got fed up already with you and your melodrama !
this night is very important .
if i have to enclose you ...
do not believe that i will not do it .
look !
do not play with me , demon' s fetus !
what bad place to hide itself .
i already take one , i lack two .
allow me to go out !
allow me to go out !
i go away to freeze !
allow me to go out !
kevin : have you seen prescott ?
lately , not .
ah , it is typical of him .
it spends it to him being smelly when you do not want it ... and when you need it , it does not drop by any side .
ah !
did the guests already come ?
what was of coming elegantly late ?
i do not like presuming , but ... yes it will be the holiday of the period .
it is entering another call .
good , there we meet .
say .
carmelina : how are you ?
what ?
oh , not !
his flight was cancelled for the snowfall .
sigh , i also .
destroyed .
yes , very well .
we will see them tomorrow .
happy christmas .
what are we going to do ?
it will be only a common holiday .
the christmas night in your house it does not seem to me to be common at all .
but it will not be the holiday of the period .
and if we announce our commitment today ?
this night ?
i know that we were going to wait to that your divorce was official ... but only weeks are absent , your children are already well informed ... and it will do that this night it is very special .
good , if it makes you happy .
where are these types ?
marv , i have to go to the bath .
edge , you will go to the bath in one week .
always with hurries .
to open door .
well .
do you remember the plan ?
what plan ?
that of harry ?
what ...
not !
harry' s plan not !
that of the rope and the costal !
why do you shout me ?
i you am not they shout ...
do you remember the plan ?
yes .
when the prince rises to sleeping ...
ai costal !
we kidnap the asleep child .
you are a genius , marv .
this way it is .
to open door .
the prince will go in the costal .
the costal will go out for the window .
yes .
we go down for the rope .
to close door .
exact .
all to the van .
and we will go away before they realize nothing .
what beautiful plan , marv .
it is elegant for his simplicity .
very well .
we are going to prove it .
get to the costal .
i ?
why do not you get ?
because i am the chief .
get to the costal , edge .
i do not want to get to the costal .
edge , get already !
please !
you did not say to me that it would have that to get to the costal .
i wanted to give you the surprise .
it will be entertaining .
i am in the costal !
well .
very well .
to open window .
do not worry , fondness .
i hold you .
marv !
allow me to fall down carefully .
as always , my love .
i should not have eaten this slice of cake .
perfect .
to open door .
he is careless .
everything is under control .
it was easy , but extremely brilliant .
thank you for muffling my fall , bonbon .
like always .
out of here and do not return !
i already know what they plan .
ah , yes , know it all ?
what ?
they want to kidnap the prince .
keep silent about you , small idiot !
i am going to kill it .
good .
edge , fondness .
a hand ?
yes , fondness .
it would be wonderful .
i would like the help .
i recorded all his words .
welcome .
where is the real family ?
his flight was cancelled by snow .
where is prescott ?
i do not find it .
rare what .
molly , take charge of that they all have champagne .
we are going to do a special reporting .
yes , lady .
how is life ?
how is life ?
i am desirable to see them .
fondness ?
do they allow me his attention ?
i am going to kill that one ...
this is always a special night , but today it it is even more .
catch it !
peter and i are awkward !
this might not go out worse .
marv , flames are going out for you .
thank you , baby .
you also are nice .
not , my life .
they are flames indeed .
you know already , i do exercise .
you know ...
i am not lying .
the villains have returned .
we are not advancing .
kevin , i spoke with those of the catering and with molly .
nobody saw anything , only you .
how do you explain it to yourself ?
i do not know .
but i heard that they are going to kidnap to the prince .
the oste to say it ?
yes , with my device to spy .
and prescott also is involved .
this is absurd .
i am going to call to asking ... if the flight of the real family it is for tomorrow .
kevin , i know what is happening here .
yes ?
yes .
you are determined to destroy ...
my relation with natalie .
what ?
you knew the important thing that was today for her ... and it happened to you to do this madness .
it is not true .
i have given you freedom ... because i know the difficult thing that has been for you the divorce .
but this night you came too much distant view .
go to your room and he thinks what you did .
when you are ready to apologize with natalie , we will speak .
to close door .
here you are , george . !
happy christmas . !
mom ?
ah , kevin .
i am made happy by much that you have been called .
are you well ?
yes , yes .
i see beautiful what is to live . !
yes ?
you already know how it affects me .
in what channel is it ?
in eight .
the fact is that i am charmed with the happy ends .
how does the holiday go ?
are you amusing yourself ?
it is well .
and you ?
are you spending well the christmas night ?
yes .
very well .
i love you very much , kevin .
i also , mom .
happy christmas .
happy christmas .
good .
farewell .
kevin : are you awake ?
yes .
your father and i were hard with you .
are you well ?
yes .
good what .
because if you do again something equal ...
i will put you of legs in the street .
what your father goes away to get divorced ?
all the parents divorce .
this way it is the life .
it will happen already to you .
but do not interfere between your father and me .
i wants that they are a part of his life , and it seems to me to be admirable .
but if you want that it is a part of your life , do not get with me .
understood ?
what good .
i will do that they arrange this window in the first hour tomorrow .
sweet sleep .
for my biggest brother george , the richest man of the city .
i have just had a nice conversation with kevin .
i believe that we start understanding each other .
what you see ?
beautiful what is to live . !
they have spent it the whole night .
they see .
look at her with me .
i already saw her .
and what ?
so ...
i do not understand the persons who see the movies again and again .
i saw her .
i cried .
with once it is enough to me .
you are joking .
kate and i see her with the children every year .
it is a familiar tradition .
but ... now when you are going to have a new family ... probably it is the moment of having new traditions .
they are going to return .
and if nobody believes me ... alone i will have to catch them .
buttons and functlons
keep silent about you , small idiot .
keep silent about you , idiot .
the ist nstructlvo of operacln how to programme the remote control
well , for .
it turns more rapid .
get to the costal .
keep silent about you , body of costal . !
it is a christmas .
happy christmas , kevin .
happy christmas , dad !
they see here !
are you ready to go out , peter ?
to go out ?
adnde ?
kevin , natalie and i go for the real family .
right now ?
are not we going to open the gifts ?
they will have to wait to our return .
but it is a christmas .
why do the two have to go ?
in occasions , you have to do things that you do not want to do .
this is one of these occasions .
we will return very soon : yes ?
and nothing will happen in our absence .
truth ?
yes .
good what .
it lasts .
we are not late .
to open door .
happy christmas , kevin .
happy christmas .
not , already we are awake .
i was not !
in agreement .
we go for there .
it makes me nervous .
vmonos , my life .
it knew it .
there they come .
the first step ... to eliminate the accomplice .
mr. prescott ?
mr. prescott : is it there ?
can it help me ?
with what ?
another batter ?
not .
a bottle of wine .
how ?
natalie said that we had ... that to bring came from the cellar , for the real family .
if it is obligatory .
i suppose that you were right .
we are no going to have snow this christmas .
it is always better not to wait for anything .
mr. prescott , has been wonderful to be with you .
these days .
the time flies when you amuse yourself .
i know that we begin badly , but the things can improve ... very much .
because you are there below , and i here , above .
jovencito , opens the door !
allow me to go out !
oh !
you do not know what taste it gives me to see you !
the abductors come already .
but this time , i went forward them .
i enclosed his accomplice in the cellar .
it is the perfect plan : not ?
it it would be , wanted , except for a detail ...
prescott is not his accomplice .
i am .
you are ...
are you the accomplice ?
i am afraid that yes .
hello , mom .
we come already .
ah , yes , i understand .
mom ?
is i your son ?
i said to you that it was very naughty .
hear me !
sultame !
walking !
there is no a trap door or a little ?
not .
it is not usual for them to be in the cellars where one guards the wine .
it is right .
does any idea happen to him ?
none .
but i bring my cell phone .
perfect !
does it allow it to me ?
insurance .
thank you .
buzz ?
are you , kevin ?
yes .
i am calling of the cellular one .
ah , of the cellular one .
congratulations , idiot .
also did she give it to you ?
what boaster .
i will try again .
buzz , before you hang , needed to say something to you .
i need to speak with mom .
well .
you already said it to me .
i will try again later .
why did you think that i was the accomplice ?
if he had not behaved so rarely , i would not have thought that i was ... so rare .
where was the first time what did they put ?
why did not he answer the intercom ?
why did it extinguish the cameras ?
i was not .
if these hooligans used molly' s remote control ... they extinguished the safety system .
why did it accuse me of lying ?
because i believed that you were lying .
besides , he did not want that miss .
natalie it knew that ...
i there was ... taken a siesta in the skilful hours .
this woman .
if i could make to work 24 hours a day , it would do it .
it is completely inhuman .
so , when she is not , i ...
he takes advantage .
i take a rest .
a pretty and well deserved rest .
since the cameras were extinguished , i did not realize anything .
so ...
it wanted to save the bottom .
exactly .
it calls your mom again .
yes .
he waits .
kevin , i do not hear you .
i am enclosed in a cellar .
not ...
my love , i do not hear you .
there is too many interference .
i am enclosed in the cellar of natalie !
do you call to wishing me happy christmas ?
are you there ?
fondness ?
are you there , mom ?
mom ?
mom ?
sigh , what marvel !
the battery became exhausted .
mansion kalban .
hello , i am kate mccallister , the mom of kevin .
can i speak with him ?
kevin is not for the time being .
rare what .
it has just called me .
ah , yes ?
it went out with his father and miss .
natalie .
ah .
surely it called me of the cellular one of his dad .
by it the call was cut .
well .
thank you .
the small devil it called his mother .
am i going to prove to be to him the one who is the chief ?
sit down , marv .
you are not the chief .
the chief i am .
good .
but his cellular one is dead .
it will not give us any more problems .
a cookie .
peter , i am .
i cut the call with kevin .
kevin is not with me .
it is in natalie' s house .
seriously ?
they have just said to me that was with you .
so ...
do not worry , kate .
surely , everything is well .
rare what .
someone said to kate that kevin is with us .
it should go i hope it is well .
not .
this is exactly what he wants .
peter , it is manipulating you .
have not you noticed the pattern ?
whenever we go out , it does something .
only it wants to call your attention and to sabotage me .
hello !
is there anybody there ?
hello !
there has to be something that we could do to go out of here .
and yes there is .
help me to move the boxes .
insurance .
but : what is there behind ?
you will not have to mount astride .
the montaplatos !
lottery .
i hope and still work .
lamentation to have misjudged it , gentleman .
equally .
i will never forget the reaction of miss .
natalie ... when it came and saw what you had done to him to his house .
i am charmed with seeing when it gives him the dizzy spell !
it is one of few pleasures of this work .
if so much he hates the work , why does not he resign ?
it is not easy to obtain an employment .
besides , it might end up by working with worse someone .
it should not of remaining only because it is afraid .
the life is too short .
it froze there .
let' s see if you fit .
it rises .
care with the head .
as soon as rise , i will open to him the door .
look after very much : yes ?
i say to you that i heard something .
well .
it is necessary to be very alert , edge .
look : why do not you go down to checking the cellar ?
yes .
it walks , sees .
here below !
it will be better than ...
what ?
sigh !
press the button !
last , my love !

press the button !
what ?
i do not hear you .
press the button !
not , not !

that one is !
here i am !
hello , mom .

to open door .
natalie , you sees for the real family .
i go i hope kevin is well .

i anticipate it .
it will be that you are not a mother .
it is not just .
i love the children .
how much do you want to my child ?
taxi !

mom : you believe that you might diminish the speed ?
kevin is well .
you warn me if you see the police , yes ?
good , edge .
go to check the room .
i hope it is there : in agreement ?
for god !
i cannot believe it .
he had studied some career skill , as assistant of dentist .
marv !

what happens to you ?
i am not any costal .
and do you know what ?
you are not any genius !
edge , fondness ...

do not say to me " fondness " !
fondness ...
the child is more intelligent than you ... and if you have not realized , it is defeating us .
from now on , i will be my own chief !
edge .
edge , fondness ...
that you do not say to me " fondness " !
bonbon .
bonbon .
marv , forget her , go for the child !
i will go out in a few minutes .

for , sesame .
good jump , marv .
happy christmas to all , and that they all have good night .
good night .
mr. prescott !
to your orders .
what taste does it give me to see it .
probably we should call the police .
good idea , mr. prescott .
you me can tutear .
you said that you did not worry .
i do not know , i anticipated something .
who are ?
sigh , not !
vmonos of here !

i already gave notice to the police .
i have them planned many entertaining activities .

peter !
what did this time ?
this time , it saved the situation .
you should give to him thank you .
molly ?
what is happening , for god ?
they were going to kidnap the prince .
it seems that she was the chief .
she is my servant .
i am his chief !
it seems that you will have to look for yourself another servant .
and to another butler , also .
i resign .
do you resign ?
but ... why ?
because , as a wise young man said : " the life is too short " .
do something , peter .
very well .
i will speak .
natalie ...
i believe that i confused ... the infatuation and the emotion with the love .
look , this one ... this is your world , not mine .
the time through that i lived here i spent it missing my family .
i am in love with my wife and of my children ... and my place is with them .
i want to return to house .
i will be able to understand if you need to think it .
i love you .
i love you .
jovencito : how are we going to do to demonstrate our gratitude ?
they want to spend the christmas with my family ?
it is heard brilliantly .
does it can ?
yes .
are you going to happen the day with them ?
today ?
in christmas ?
thank you .
to ignite music .
to fall down snow .
it knew that this one would be the best christmas of all !
if a friend gets involved in a relationship , it affects your friendship .
because you' re like a comedy team , and now there' s this third person .
who' s on first ?
i don' t know .
dear , who do you think is on first ?
i look like the person you used to know ... ... but i' ve been modified to survive in this relationship .
in other words , if we' re having an argument and she' s there ... ... i may say , ' i totally disagree with you . '
' i' d like to help you out , but i' d rather continue to see her naked . " '
okay , cowboys , what will you have ?
i' il have the turkey club without the bacon .
and i' il have the bacon club without the turkey .
george , don' t make me get tough with you .
why ?
you think you can beat me up ?
you wouldn' t want me to mess up that beautiful face of yours .
stop it .
stop it .
you don' t want bacon .
i' il surprise you .
is she not terrific ?
she does have a way .
you think she thinks i have a beautiful face ?
well , they do work on tips .
george , don' t make me get tough with you .
who says that ?
she is really cool .
what do you think ?
you think she likes me ?
i should' ve got the egg white omelet .
why should she like me ?
who am i ?
there' s a million people to like .
the omelet .
damn .
maybe she could like me .
is it that far fetched ?
maybe she sees something .

well , that relationship has obviously got a lot of potential .
yeah , well , jerome ... ... i happen to be flying him in on my frequent flier miles .

how long is he staying for ?
it' s an open ended ticket .
he can return anytime he wants .

okay , thanks .
oh , jerry , you know what just hit me ?
i was thinking ...

well , i don' t know if ...
oh , come on .

it' s not even on the menu .
oh , this is fabulous .
boy , she is nice .
i like her .
i like her , jerry .
she' s got substance .
she oozes substance .
well , go in there and talk to her .
she' s not gonna put them on the glass .
you mean the walk back in ?
that' s the toughest move in the business .
you' re sending me into no mars land ... ... and if i get shot down , i have to crawl back .
well , i can' t do it , i tell you !
pull yourself together .
you' re going in there , soldier .
that' s an order !
get in there .
hey .
hey .
listen , i need you to do me a favor .
what ?
help me move my refrigerator .
why ?
because i' m getting rid of it .
yeah ?
it' s k. b. i have the suit .
all right , come on up .
so ...
why get rid of your refrigerator ?
after that kidney stone , i only want fresh food .
it' s gotta be fresh .
i' m not eating any more stored food .
plus , you know , i want the space .
what for ?
well , i could put a dresser in there .
i could get dressed while i' m making breakfast .
hey !
here you go .
yeah .
didrt think i was really gonna give you a suit , did you ?
you' re giving him this suit ?
that' s right .
and it' s armani .
armani ?
hey , armani , jerry .
yes , yes , i heard .
come on , try it on .
no , it' s okay .
come on .
i want to see how it fits .
all right .
there you go .
there , okay ?
oh , boy .
look at that .
that looks great .
i can' t believe you' re giving him this .
and i don' t even want anything for it .
he' s very generous , isn' t he ?
yes .
yes , he is .
i' il tell you what , you can take me out to dinner sometime .
dinner ?
yeah , you buy me a meal .
can' t get a better deal than that .
you' il never get a better deal .
all right , i' il leave you alone .
yeah , yeah .
look at that .
armani .
yeah .
yeah , that' s a deal .
that' s a terrible deal .
i don' t want to go out to dinner with him .
i' d rather make my own suit .
i did it .
it' s all done .
hey .
i did it .
we' re going out as soon as she gets off work .
and it' il still be daytime .
i' m better in the daytime than at night .
it' s less pressure .
i love the day date .
no wine , no shower .
there you go .
so the trip was good ?
yes .
apart from that dreadful airline food .
wreaked absolute havoc with my stomach .
you know , i have to say , i' ve never admitted this to anyone ... ... but i kind of like airline food .
that' s probably because of ...
what ?
what ?
yeah , what ?
what ?
where i come from , we don' t say " what .
it' s proper to say " pardon .
oh , this should be interesting .
pardon ?
nothing .
so then , about a year ago , i started selling these funky little hair clips .
it' s going pretty good .
i make them in my apartment .
i' m just waitressing because i wanted to go to europe this summer ... ... and i could use a few extra ...
careful .
oh , it' s just horse manure .
horse manure' s not that bad .
i don' t even mind the word " manure .
you know , it' s " nure , " which is good ... ... and a " ma " in front of it .
manure .
when you consider the other choices , " manure " is actually pretty refreshing .
that' s a nice watch , george .
yeah .
you know , my boyfriend has the same one .
really ?
yeah , he loves watches .
he' s a real watch freak .
well , how about that ?
oh , look out .
you stepped right in it .
yes .
i sure did .
so you just pretended it didn' t bother you ?
what is that ?
boyfriend ?
i don' t understand that .
what does she think i asked her out for ?
it' s the way they just slip it in there too .
yeah , like it' s all just part of the conversation .
my boyfriend really likes watches .
he' s a real watch freak .
well , that' s fabulous .
well , let me ask you this .
what exactly did you say when you asked her out ?
i said , " would you like to go for a walk or something ?
oh , a walk ?
well ...
or something .
i said " or something .
or something ?
yeah , that' s a date .
there you go .
of course , there is always the possibility that she called an audible .
what do you mean ?
she got to the line of scrimmage ... ... didn' t like the looks of the defense and changed the play .
i think things were going okay .
we were having a nice conversation .
i mentioned how i liked horse manure .
you did ?
yeah .
you said you liked horse manure ?
yeah .
you know , about how , when you break it down , it' s really a very positive thing .
you know , you have a " nure " with a " ma " in front of it .
manure .
it' s not bad .
and it was around this point she mentioned the boyfriend ?
yeah .
oh , you think because of what i said about the manure ?
i was just saying how it takes a negative thing ... ... and puts a positive spin on it .
i' m just saying there' s a chance she may not have been enamored ... ... with your thoughts and feelings on manure .
so you don' t think she really has a boyfriend .
my honest opinion ?
i think she made it up .
well , then she' s just a liar , isn' t she ?
hey .
you want something to eat , don' t you ?
oh , no , no , no .
you got me all wrong , buddy .
i am loving this no refrigerator .
you know what i discovered ?
i really like depriving myself of things .
it' s fun .
very monastic .
well , what do you eat ?
it' s all fresh .
fresh fish , fresh fowl , fresh fruit .
i buy it .
i eat it .
well , i' m glad it' s working out .
oh , yeah .
it' s working out .
and i got a date with that waitress who works at reggie' s .
boy , if i could meet a hostess , we could open up our own place .
yeah .
well , i' il tell you , she' s a full figured gal .
is she ?
oh , you better believe it , buddy .
george , we could double sometime .
yeah , yeah , we could .
you know , kramer , the next time you talk to her ... ... find out if she knows kelly from monk' s .
i want to know if she really has a boyfriend .
all right , let' s get over here .
hello .
hi , jerry .
it' s kenny .
oh , hi .
i was thinking , if you' re not busy ... ... maybe i can get my meal today ?
yeah , you want to get that meal , don' t you ?
how about mendy' s .
ever been there ?
no , i haven' t .
you' re gonna love it .
i' il meet you there around 7 .
all right .
yeah , i really needed that suit .
i start off with curls .
that' s good for the bicep .
i do 10 reps , two sets .
that' s fantastic .
you work out with weights ?
i don' t .
you should .
why ?
you worn the suit yet ?
no , not yet .
have you decided ?
oh , get the swordfish .
best swordfish in the city .
the best , jerry .
i' il have the salmon .
and you ?
you know what i think ?
i' m just gonna have soup .
yeah , i' il save the meal for another time .
another time ?
what other time ?
i had a hot dog earlier .
i' m not that hungry .
no , no , bania , no .
this is the dinner .
the soup counts .
soup' s not a meal .
you' re supposed to buy me a meal .
i' m not stopping you from eating .
go ahead .
get anything you want .
but i don' t want anything but soup .
then that' s the meal .
but i had the hot dog .
who told you to have a hot dog ?
hey , i give you a brand new armani suit ... ... and you won' t even buy me a meal .
all right , fine .
get the soup .
so he just gets soup .
he wants to save the meal .
so now i got to do it all over again .
what kind of soup did he get ?
i don' t know .
consomme or something .
consomme .
what ?
well , that' s really not a meal , jerry .
i mean , if he had gotten chicken gumbo or matzo ball ... ... even mushroom barley , then i would agree with you .
those are very hearty soups .
you' re missing the whole point .
what ?
the meal is the act of sitting down with him .
it doesn' t matter what you get .
as long as he' s sitting in that restaurant , it' s a meal .
was it a cup or a bowl ?
you see ?
again .
i' m just curious .
a bowl , okay ?
did he crumble any crackers in it ?
did he crumble any crackers in it ?
as a matter of fact , he did .
oh , well , crackers in a bowl .
that could be a meal .
it' s like i' m talking to my aunt sylvia here .
hi , simon .
this is jerry .
hello .
elaine , do you have cash on you ?
yeah , in my purse .
no , there was only $6 .
well , i have some money .
what do you need ?
twenty should cover me .
thanks , mate .
where are you going ?
just visiting .
okay .
see you later .
i won' t be back for dinner .
pardon ?
so is she working ?
is she here ?
yeah , yeah , she' s here .
have you said anything ?
no .
i' m very uncomfortable .
are you gonna say anything ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
hello .
hello .
well , what' s it going to be ?
" what' s it gonna be ?
yes .
what will you have ?
are you eating ?
it' s in that vein .
i' il just have a bowl of chili .
i' il have an egg white omelet .
" what' s it gonna be ? " hear that ?
yeah , that was bad .
did you feel that tension ?
we used to have banter .
there' s no more banter .
oh , no .
it' s kenny .
slide out so he can' t sit here .
hey .
hey .
you worn the suit yet ?
actually i did .
i put it on last night and slept in it .
you did ?
no , i' m joking .
can i squeeze in ?
sure you can .
thanks .
can i take your order ?
what kind of soup do you have ?
why don' t you get a sandwich .
okay .
i' il have tomato soup and tuna on toast .
okay .
this is it , you know .
this is the meal .
so stock up , buddy boy .
what are you talking about ?
this isn' t a meal .
yes , it is .
soup and sandwich .
that is a meal .
you' re supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant like mendy' s .
i tried to do that .
this is lunch in a coffee shop .
it doesn' t matter .
this is it .
this completes the transaction .
oh , soup and a sandwich for a brand new armani suit .
is that any kind of a gesture ?
i' m really not comfortable ...
hey , i just spoke to hildy about your friend .
yeah ?
she doesn' t have a boyfriend .
she made it up .
hi .
hi .
where' s simon ?
oh , he' il be right up .
he' s just getting some beer .
and i' m not expecting any change .
whers he leaving ?
about two days .
although he' s hinting at how he' d like to stay .
fortunately , he has no money and no prospects .
hey , mate .
fancy a beer ?
no , thanks .
hello ?
no , i' m sorry , bania .
i' m not going over this again .
well , who told you to order soup ?
no , there' s no dinner .
there' s not going to be any dinner .
you' ve had a sandwich and two bowls of soup , and that' s it .
goodbye .
hey , what size suit are you ?
forty .
forty .
perfect .
brand new armani suit , you want it ?
absolutely .
great .

i can' t stand the sight of it .
elaine , here' s the car keys .

yep .

i don' t have your suit .
i gave it away .
well , it' s my suit .
well , it' s gone .
i' m sorry .
goodbye , bania .
hey .
hey .
yeah .
well , how' s everything ?
okay .

it' s not for me , it' s for hildy , the waitress i was telling you about .
she' s hungry .

there' s a few things in here .
peanut butter , cheese .
yeah .
cheese is good .
what kind ?
swiss .
all right , it' il have to do .
come on .
what are you doing out here ?
i can' t go in there .
i' m too uncomfortable .
so we' re not gonna go in there anymore ?
hey , what are you doing out here ?
we can' t eat here anymore , because he took a waitress for a walk .
what' s the difference ?
let' s go to reggie' s .
reggie' s ?
i can' t eat anything there .
it' s the same menu .
there' s no big salad .
they' il make you a big salad .
what do you think , they' re the only ones that make a big salad ?
all right , let' s go to reggie' s .
so , what' s going on with simon ?
did he leave ?
wait till you hear this .
so simon picks this woman up right in front of me .
look at this .
no egg white omelets .
look at that .
so what ?

it won' t kill you .
hello .
oh , hi , hildy .
could i get an egg white omelet ?
did you read the menu ?
all right .
just give me a western .
how about a big salad ?
a big salad ?
you see ?
just tell her what you want .
they' il make it for you .
it' s a salad , only bigger , with lots of stuff in it .
i can bring you two small salads .
could you put it in a big bowl ?
we don' t have big bowls .
all right , just give me a cup of decaf .
we have sanka .
i mean , it' s not fair .
i' ve been going there for seven years .
she' s been there three weeks .
not fair .
if anyone should be forced to leave , it should be her .
she' s on your turf .
if only she could get fired .
is there any way that could happen ?
i mean , i know how to get myself fired .
you' re the best .
well ...
how do i get someone else fired ?
well , as i see it ... ... you' ve got to apply the same principles that get you fired ... ... but redirected outwardly .
hey .
hey .
she' s hungry , jerry .
well , there' s nothing left .
there' s no food .
no food ?
well , you gotta have something .
i can' t go back in there with no food .
she expecting something , jerry .
you don' t know what she' s like when that blood sugar drops .
there , you see , she' s already in a bad mood .
she just got fired .
why did she get fired ?
because i called over there a couple of times ... ... and the manager didn' t like it .
simon is definitely going back now .
he' s meeting me here to return my keys .
boy , he' s a real bounder , isn' t he ?
yes , he' s one of those bounders .
egg white omelet , big salad .

that' s right ; i' m neither .
i play my opponent .
if he likes to attack , i force him to defend himself .
if he' s a cautious man , i draw him into dangerous waters .
see , you get so frustrated playing defensive positions ... you make stupid moves you' d never make if you were thinkin ' .
when you come here , boy , check that shit at the door .
that' s good .

you find your niche , you stay there , you stay cool ... and you be the man into your 50' s and 60' s .
and then you retire your old ass to a nice condo someplace hot ... with a lot of nicejewish people .
leave the business for your kids .

all these other pieces are just a means to do it .
every time you make a good run at me , i just threaten your q ueen and back you go .
you' re treatin ' her like she' s the last lady on earth .
your queen is just a pawn with a lot of fancy moves , nothing more ,
when you see you' re playin ' a man who feels naked without his lady , use her .
jump in there and take her , tease her , threaten her ... and he won' t be able to think about his game anymore .
that' s when you make your real move .
that' s good .
that' s better .
you like that horse , don' t you ?
you like his crazy jumps all over the board .
think he' s your friend , hate to lose him ... almost as much as you hate to lose that lady ,
well , he is your friend , boy .
they all are .
but you' re gonna have to use him , just like you use the others .
if he falls by the wayside , well , that' s just life' s little game , ain' t it ?

there will be changes around here after today , and i will personally see that you will be the first one to go .
allow me .
wipe off those filthy hands !
take this .
oh , for me ?
carry it to the house , you idiot !
here you are , my dear .
do come in , edmund .
my dear lillian .
i' m so sorry i' m late , but there' s so much to do in handling the oglethorpe enterprises now that dear oscar has passed on .
you are a good friend , edmund .
and such a comfort in my time of need .
i hope more than a friend , lillian .
as the lawyer for the oglethorpe family ,
i have been entrusted with the last will and testament of oscar winterhaven oglethorpe .
edmund , i beg your pardon .
yes , dear lady ?
i must apologize , but we really must wait for my personal solicitor , roland t. flakfizer .
jacques .
lillian ,
i' ve been employed by your late husband for over 1 3 years .
are you dismissing me ?
good heavens , no , edmund .
i was involved in a minor accident with the bentley last year .
miraculously , he was by my side to assist me .
oh , jacques , i want you to go to this address and summon this gentleman at once .
i' ve been calling all morning and leaving messages .
i can' t seem to reach him .
yes , mrs. o ...
lillian , how long must we wait ?
i can assure you , once mr. flakfizer receives my message , he will race to be by my side .
anyone hurt ?
roland t. flakfizer , attorney at law .
don' t try to get up .
i specialize in accident cases .
we' re both fine .
i know what i' m doing , i know what i' m doing .
you wouldn' t happen to have any french fries on you , would you ?
all right , all right .
step back , step back .
i' ve got injured clients here .
sir , you have caused grievous harm to my clients and their vehicle .
and through your negligence , this child has suffered severe neck injuries .
leave me alone .
stick with me , kid , and you can afford enough nintendo software to sink a battleship .
i can sue my parents ?
i sued mine .
my neck !
corruptible youth .
god bless them .
my lord , madam .
you shouldn' t be walking in your condition .
this woman is with child .
if any harm came to this infant , by god , sir , you will feel my wrath in court .
what are you talking about ?
don' t try to weasel out of this .
dozens of witnesses saw your reckless driving .
how many of you saw this man carelessly , and without regard for life and property , careen into my clients at almost 85 miles per hour ?
and who of you will tell their story to my young , 24 year old ,
miss lnternational wet t shirt champion , nymphomaniac secretary ?
yo !
right here !
right here !
hey , hey !
flakfizer' s at it again , i see .
check for outstanding ...
roland t. flakfizer ?
that' s him .
thank you very much .
you agree with me , i agree with you .
hold that thought .
i swear , i never touched your daughter .
taxi !
here we go .
get in .
get in .
where to ?
any place with no extradition laws .
and step on it .
right .
mr. roland t. flakfizer ?
that depends .
do i owe you money ?
no .
in a drunken stupor , did i promise to marry you ?
no .
then i' m your man .
lillian oglethorpe wants to see you .
the lillian oglethorpe ?
in her mid 50s , with possible gusts up to 60 , 65 ?
yes .
can you come right away ?
is she still rich ?
by all means .
the oglethorpe place .
big bucks .
yeah , you settle back , i' il get you there safe and sound .
one way street .
don' t worry , this happens a lot .
you enjoy driving a cab ?
no .
as soon as i get me driver' s license , i' m quitting .
a guy' s really gotta haul rump to make ends meet these days .
i mean , apart from the cab , i' m a pool man , i perform liposuction ,
i got me own toupee business .
something that size should have hair on it .
aren' t those numbers clicking by awfully fast ?
you' re probably a speed reader .
well , you got me there .
another two miles and we own this cab .
i hope you brought money .
oh , sure .
i have a wallet just like that .
hey , that is my wallet .
when i get some money , this could come in handy .
such behavior .
stealing another man' s wallet .
you should be ashamed of yourself .
i don' t believe it .
you !
what are you doing ?
do you know who i am ?
a psychotic cab driver ?
i' m rocco melonchek .
i hope you know you' re blowing any possible tip .
you were my attorney in my divorce case ... ... until you started dating my wife during the trial .
and you got the court to double the alimony request she originally made .
you didn' t want her to keep seeing me in cheap motels , did you ?
for god' s sake , man , she was your wife !
help me .
get off .
all right , all right , all right .
five minute break .
all right , break' s over .
wait a minute , wait .
you' re a businessman .
let' s talk business .
fine , and then i' il kill you .
i thought i recognized you .
i' ve been looking for you for the past three years .
you' re lying .
of course i am , but hear me out .
clients are impressed by a law firm with a big staff .
the more employees , the bigger the fees .
so i could use a man like you in my organization .
travel , excitement and a chance for advancement .
of course , you' il start out on the bottom rung .
but work hard and in no time you' il move up to next to the bottom rung .
you got a dental plan ?
lose a tooth , you get two free .
what' s my job ?
you can be my chauffeur .
how much ?
two hundred bucks a week .
600 .
300 .
400 .
800 .
900 .
wait a minute , wait a minute .
shouldn' t i be in this negotiation somewhere ?
350 and not a penny more .
i' il take it .
what happened to 1000 ?
i allowed for taxes .
i want four weeks in advance .
five weeks .
hold it .
i' m giving you one minute to stop this .
two minutes .
five minutes .
seven minutes .
nine minutes .
i' ve stepped into my own private hell .
we' d better get going .
the faster we get to lillian , the quicker i can afford your salaries .
for 350 bucks a week , you drive .
lillian , we really can' t wait any longer .
i suppose you' re right , edmund .
i can' t imagine what is keeping roland .
you guys wait here .
hey , you' re the boss .
the reading of the last will and testament ... ... of oscar winterhaven oglethorpe .
roland !
your royal sex machine .
i wouldn' t come without bringing you a terribly expensive gift .
i hope you like it .
it reminds me of you .
roland , how thoughtful of you .
but i believe i have one just like it .
oh , no problem .
i' il take it back and get the money .
mrs. oglethorpe , you look wonderful .
i could make love to you right here and now .
roland , please .
let' s keep this on a professional level .
very well , then .
i' il charge you 50 bucks a pop .
mr. oglethorpe !
how well i remember him .
gone now , but not forgotten .
i was never crazy about his taste in clothes .
i hope this speech doesn' t seem like a rambling affair , which is something i' m sure we' il be involved in .
oh , lillian , you make me feel just like a natural woman .
i' ve heard enough .
sir , i am appalled .
lillian , who is this man ?
roland , this is mr. edmund lazlo .
a likely story .
just look at him .
he' s obviously after your money and social standing , but i was here first .
hey , how is everyone ?
have you got any mustard in here ?
hey , i' m the boss , remember ?
i told you to wait outside .
today' s my day off .
excuse me .
and just who are you ?
he' s a member of my staff .
lillian oglethorpe , rocco melonchek .
rocco melonchek , lillian oglethorpe .
in order to tell you two apart , one of you will have to wear a mustache .
nice to meet someone else who buys their clothes at big and tall man shops .
i beg your pardon ?
why ?
you can' t help it .
refreshments .
good idea , jacques .
he was so devoted to my husband .
darling oscar is dead now , you know .
well , i hope so .
i understand they buried him .
just make yourself feel at home .
lillian ,
i really do believe we should begin .
oh , yes , yes , certainly .
will you all please find yourselves a seat ?
oh , i beg your ...
the last will and testament of oscar winterhaven oglethorpe .
do you have a bathroom ?
i protest !
this is most irregular !
lillian ...
edmund !
please be careful .
this man is in obviously no condition to carry on .
rocco , will you continue ?
lillian , i ...
right , let' s cut to the payoff here .
blah , blah , blah ...
minnesota holdings , ski boat , ski boat , ski boat ...
yacht ...
to my gay lover , i leave
it was a joke .
i was just joking .
yes .
now .
yes , here we are .
all my worldly goods to be transferred into the care of my wife , lillian .
darling .
" and because of my love for the arts , i request that half my fortune be used to establish a ballet company .
excellent .
wonderful .
nothing like the thrill of spending an evening watching a bunch of anorexics leaping around , guys with bulging genitals ...
i hope i' m not arousing you .
this is all very well and good , but i wouldn' t know the first thing
about running such a company .
mrs. oglethorpe ...
... as your trusted lawyer ...
you can use those words together ? ... and friend ... ... i naturally assumed that task would fall to me .
why would anyone wanna be the head of a ballet company ?
and the director of the company shall receive $500, 000 a year salary .
i' il take the job .
i have ballet running through my veins .
lillian , i' m your man !
outrageous !
i doubt whether he knows the difference between the first , second , third , fourth or fifth positions !
hey , he is strictly missionary position .
i will not allow a rogue like you to handle the oglethorpe ballet .
this document should be treated with the dignity and respect it deserves .
hello !
this is no time for family pictures .
charity work .
i gather these for those less fortunate than ourselves who can' t afford pornography .
edmund !
i demand this man be dismissed immediately !
jacques , you' re working for me now .
for what reason ?
does it make you angry ?
yes !
that' s a good enough reason for me .
lillian , i have a dream .
we' il bring in a whole new breed of ballet goers with innovative giveaways .
leotard nights , wet tutu competitions .
and we' il be the first company performing ballet for the hard of hearing .
we' il have the ballerinas wear wooden shoes .
mrs. oglethorpe , this man doesn' t know what he' s talking about .
now , leave this matter to me and i will sign for you the world' s premier dancer , the great volare .
volare ?
how wonderful .
wait a second !
uno pari mutuel .
not the volare !
you know the great volare ?
i knew him back when he was known as the pretty good volare .
we served in the army together .
he owes me one .
i threw myself on top of an 1 8 year old vietnamese girl and saved his life .
nonsense !
that' s where you' re wrong .
this is nonsense .
lillian , i am the only one who can bring you the world' s greatest male ballerina .
for myself , i ask only a nominal salary , plus a cut of gross receipts , a bonus of 25 percent on anything above break even , a $300 per diem , the use of a company car and housing .
by all means , make my husband' s dream come true .
what , you want him to marry a cheerleader ?
give us a ballet .
oh , this is so exciting .
i can see i am no longer required as the family lawyer .
look , i' m thinking of becoming a lawyer .
can i buy your diploma off you ?
good heavens .
i need you both .
very well , lillian .
as you wish .
for now .
then this evening i' m off to the ballet .
i must shave , shower , get new clothes and practice signing your name .
my pearl ...
i bid you all a fondue .
if you should lose this hand in an industrial accident , keep it for me .
gentlemen !
alan .
i brought this for you .
it' s not exactly a bouquet , but it' s a start .
so sweet .
were you watching the ballet again tonight ?
of course .
i love to watch you dance .
someday we' re gonna be on that stage dancing together .
at the rate i' m going , i' m not so sure .
alan , don' t talk that way .
we agreed that if one of us got into a major company , it could only help the both of us .
tonight i' m going to talk to volare about you .
i would love that .
i mean , no one dances like the great volare .
except you .
catch .
tickets , please ?
no smoking in the theater .
thank you .
my pleasure .
please .
five and six .
eleven .
25 and 67 .
miss !
these seats are dreadful .
they' re facing the stage .
hey , did we miss the coming attractions ?
who' s the bad guy ?
is tom cruise in this ?
do you work out ?
i' m looking for the great volare .
he' s on stage .
and he doesn' t appreciate visitors backstage .
no , no , no , i' m not a visitor .
this is strictly business .
this creep bothering you ?
no .
no .
she' s quite delightful , thank you .
ok , i give up .
how come he doesn' t throw up ?
bravo , mr. volare .
they love you .
that audience wouldn' t know a ballet from a bullfight .
and who are you to speak to me ?
where is my towel ?
when i come off stage , i expect my towel immediately .
do you understand me ?
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
fire him .
tina , darling , you were marvelous .
perhaps we should meet in my dressing room after the performance and discuss your career .
i' d like that very much , mr. volare .
thank you .
lisa !
darling , i thought we' d have dinner tonight after the closing night party .
oh , well , thank you , but i' m afraid i' ve already made plans .
mr. volare , i' d like you to meet my friend alan grant .
it' s a privilege to meet you , mr. volare .
i' m a huge fan of yours .
well , alan' s a dancer too , with the performing artists group , the nonprofit ballet troupe .
really ?
how sweet .
it' s a fine idea to keep busy until one is good enough to command a salary .
my cue .
she looked 1 8 , officer , i swear !
too noisy around here .
i' il say .
i got twice the sleep at a julio lglesias concert .
this guy' s gotta get off stage soon .
let' s go back , wait for him , sign him up .
excuse us .
excuse me .
we have to get this plutonium back to the lab .
jacques .
hey .
you know him ?
sure .
he used to drive mr. oglethorpe to the theater ,
then i' d sneak him into the ballet .
i' m gonna be the best man
at their wedding .
i hope so .
excuse me , we didn' t get your name .
oh , my name' s rocco melonchek .
i' m the ballet world' s up and coming manager/ agent .
i' m here to sign a contract with the great volare .
i hate to burst your bubble , but volare already has an agent and manager .
that' s too bad .
any of them real sick ?
you don' t need volare .
what you need is the next great ballet talent .
a young , fresh face .
alan grant .
exactly .
i got it right .
there' s my cue .
jacques , convince mr. melonchek alan' s the person he' s looking for .
this is all well and good , but can he dance ?
could he make millions ?
would he sign a contract for a lot of money , but take scale ,
ieaving his manager with everything else ?
sure he would .
wouldn' t you , alan ?
alan ?
can' t you see he' s watching the woman he adores ?
you' re in love with her , aren' t you ?
you bet .
when' s the wedding ?
there won' t be one ... ... unless i can find a job dancing .
to tell you the truth , mr. melonchek , i' m about out of money and i' m gonna have to go back to minneapolis .
i' il tell you what .
don' t you buy that plane ticket just yet , because i am gonna get you an audition with roland t. flakfizer , ballet director .
you could do that ?
sure .
they' re like this .
well , let' s go to work , mr. melonchek .
i now pronounce us dancer and manager .
yeah !
come in .
tina , darling .
i' m so glad you' ve come .
you were most inspiring tonight .
i can see that under my guidance , your career will soar .
already i can hear the audience roar .
who are you ?
roland t. flakfizer , managing director of the oglethorpe flakfizer ballet company .
you wouldn' t happen to have a plunger on you , would you ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh , i see you have a pretty visitor .
i' il tell you what .
i' il get a girl and we' il double .
you got five minutes , mr. volare .
five minutes ?
my god !
have you consulted another doctor ?
you are out of line .
and you are out of toilet paper .
but we' re still short one girl .
what are you doing here ?
to sign you for my ballet company .
to sign me for your ballet company ?
swear to god , i just said that .
why don' t you run along and let us men talk business .
just leave your phone number and favorite color with the manager and later we' il talk business .
you' re cute , mr ... ?
garvey .
steve garvey .
i think we have something beautiful , you and l .
someday you' il have my children .
in fact , they' re out in the car , if you want them .
oh , god ...
you' re still here ?
i will have you thrown out of the theater .
first , we talk ballet .
i know nothing of your ballet .
we have a lot in common .
i' m managing director and i don' t either .
look , i don' t dance for just anyone .
i am ballet .
my dance shoes are in the louvre in paris .
so what ?
last year , i left a raincoat in cleveland .
do you realize what i was doing at the age of 7 ?
i can imagine .
you must be thankful you didn' t go blind .
i was dancing professionally .
well , whatever you call it : flogging the carrot , polishing the cue stick , choking the chicken , clearing the snorkel ...
but i didn' t come back here to rehash good times .
volare , dance with the oglethorpe flakfizer ballet company and you can name your price .
money is no object .
it isn' t mine .
look , i' m offering you a check for $500, 000 .
it' s made out to volare , great , the .
i don' t dance for the money .
then you dance and i' il keep the money .
look , i will not dance for your ballet and that is final .
a flakfizer doesn' t know the meaning of the word " no .
and we' re a little fuzzy on the word " panagglutinin " and " viscosity .
all right , all right .
let' s sweeten the pot .
the same money ,
we throw in a girl .
no !
then would you object to me getting one ?
i' m a lonely man , mr. volare .
i will give you till the count of ten to get out of here .
one , two , three  before you get stuck somewhere around six , i' il go .
if there' s anything i can ever do for you , forget it .
because i don' t do those kind of things .
and for the last time , i warn you about that highly contagious rash .
i beg you to see to it at once .
hygiene , mr. volare .
hygiene .
mr. flakfizer .
where ? !
i' m sorry , i thought my father showed up .
come here , come here .
did volare accept your offer ?
i didn' t know the meaning of the word " no , " but he had it down pretty good .
you wouldn' t happen to have a world famous dancer stuffed in a drawer somewhere , would you ?
as a matter of fact , i would .
his name' s alan grant .
he can dance rings around volare .
he' s even more talented than gorbachev .
gesundheit .
baryshnikov .
god bless you .
baryshnikov .
hi .
how' s it going ?
how you doing ?
you look very nice today .
he' s one of the best dancers in the country .
hire him for the ballet .
what do you say ?
no , no , nay , nyet .
i have to find some way to sign volare .
when i do that , i' m director of the ballet .
and , gentlemen , that spells cash with a capital ...
k.
you should go back to school .
i hated teaching .
flakfizer , i thought you were smart .
i am smart .
i said no to you , didn' t l ?
i' m offering you two incomes .
your paycheck from the ballet company and then when you sign alan grant to dance , another hefty check as part of alan' s management team .
how do we get this past mrs. oglethorpe ?
relax .
after she sees alan dance , you' ve got nothing to worry about .
except for taxes , depletion of the ozone layer and diseases due to any sexual contact .
that' s a load off my mind .
all you gotta do is convince mrs. oglethorpe to let alan into the charity bazaar .
are you kidding ?
i can charm the pants off of her .
now , that is a disgusting thought .
gentlemen , you' re gonna have to sneak him in .
not so fast .
you know , i worry about you , i really do .
we' re gonna make this legal .
we need a contract .
a binding document , with plenty of loopholes .
exactly .
jacques , draw up the standard contract , would you , please ?
hello , jacques .
we' ve got years to go before we even come close to the japanese .
right .
sign that .
this paper' s blank .
i' il fill it in later .
fair enough .
you' re not gonna cheat me or anything ?
i give you my word as a gentleman .
well , you had me until then .
all right , all right .
fifty fifty split .
now , this is more like it .
what about me ?
to show you no favoritism , rocco and i
will also split your salary fifty fifty .
thanks .
that should keep you out of a higher income bracket .
come to think of it , that should keep you out of any income bracket .
rocco , jacques , tomorrow , alan grant joins the oglethorpe ballet company .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... welcome to the ninth annual oglethorpe charity festival .
let' s go .
it gives me great pleasure to announce the oglethorpe ballet company will be leaving for new york tomorrow , where we ...
you two go and get dressed .
be ready in ten minutes .
t en minutes ?
we' il be ready .
and you' re gonna be a star .
you know , if you keep this up , i may even start to believe it .
nice to have a chance to make someone' s wish come true .
that' s a nice thing to do .
well , how did the market close ?
well , roll over my amalgamated , split my utilities and double my capital venture overlays .
now , call me in an hour and tell me what the hell i' m talking about .
pull over .
everybody all set ?
we' ve got everything so under control , it' s pathetic .
and so is he .
good .
driver , drive on .
look out for that truck !
buffy ...
lillian .
get this thing up on the rack and have it overhauled .
better yet , why don' t you get up on the rack and i' il see you in an hour .
avanti !
here , buffy .
there you are .
darling .
have you come to see mommy ?
what a charming little animal .
do you know dogs , mr. melonchek ?
know dogs ?
i used to be a chef in a korean restaurant .
good food , good friends , good conversation .
roland , i' m so upset volare turned us down .
i know .
what a slap in our collective faces .
like i told you , he has no respect for our ballet .
i wouldn' t want a man like that dancing for me .
or with me , for that matter .
i offered him half the moon .
i keep asking myself , " why didn' t he sign with us ?
because he said he wouldn' t work with you if you were the last person on earth .
what was that ?
nothing .
fetch .
my darling lillian , volare has shunned us .
hold your chins up high , for i have discovered a fabulous young dancer .
a talent that soars .
volare .
it' s volare !
oh , good heavens .
it' s him .
it' s volare .
step back .
step back .
step back .
lillian , permit me to introduce
the great volare .
i' ve seen greater .
signorvolare , i understand you' ve refused to dance with our company .
the truth of the matter is mr. volare won' t work with mr. flakfizer .
but , my dear lillian , i am happy to announce that i have signed mr. volare to dance with and to be the artistic director of the oglethorpe ballet company .
ladies and gentlemen , the overture has started .
overture to what ?
the ballet find of the century .
what ?
roll up !
roll up !
top class ballet , this way !
lillian , just a little surprise i cooked up .
if you don' t like it , it was rocco' s idea .
oh , roland , i love a surprise .
yeah !
yo , rocco , rocco .
mrs. oglethorpe , meet the future world champion of ballet ,
mr. alan grant .
it' s a pleasure .
nice to meet you .
mrs. oglethorpe , i would like to make an announcement .
he' s being deported .
i have found my prima ballerina ...
... the lovely miss lisa le baron .
what ?
well ...
but what about alan ?
shall we say , a most unusual technique .
perhaps better suited to experimental theater .
you can' t talk to my client like that .
if alan isn' t in the company , i won' t be either .
neither will l .
that' s a victory for all mankind .
you' re making a mistake , my dear .
lisa , i agree with volare .
but , alan , we' il be apart for months .
remember when you told me that with you dancing ,
it would be good for both of us ?
yes , but
when volare makes you a star , you can choose anyone to dance with .
dance with the oglethorpe .
come on .
i' il be the proudest guy in the country .
all right .
you' ve made a wise choice , my dear .
then it' s settled .
i am so excited .
you' re excited ?
feel these nipples .
now , lillian , about the directorship of the ballet company ...
oh , yes .
yes , of course , edmund .
you have brought us the great volare .
and dear roland has presented us with our ballerina .
i think it only fair that you and roland share the honor .
flakfizer ?
this is preposterous .
preposterous , is it ?
why don' t we step outside
and settle this like men .
we are outside .
then why don' t we step inside and settle this like women .
or are you afraid , lazlo ?
i' m twice the man you are .
so is she .
and it' s driving me mad .
oh , lillian , can' t you see i' m on fire ?
and you , you contemptible cur !
maybe you don' t want to work for mrs. oglethorpe .
is that so , edmund ?
of course not !
i will do anything that is best for the ballet .
well , there' s no need to commit suicide .
and to show you no hard feelings , how about a cigar .
i don' t smoke .
well , i do .
why don' t you run out and get me one .
and now , since i' m in charge of the ballet , just jamming that thought home , i propose a toast .
champagne !
i' m not going to work with such an uncouth pig .
certainly , mr. volare .
now it' s on to new york !
and a hefty per diem .
good morning .
good morning .
here you go .
here you go .
i' m all out of american currency .
take a fistful of romanian 50s , all right ?
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
the end of another grueling day .
the press conference is to begin in five minutes .
roland seems to be running a little late .
late ?
that charlatan hasn' t been around in weeks .
i don' t know why you put up with him .
he' s never in his office .
he never responds to his calls .
he' s totally irresponsible .
lisa .
relax , my dear .
everyone is nervous their first time .
just follow my lead .
i' m very experienced .
that' s very kind of you , mr. volare .
oh , come on .
call me roberto .
roberto .
lisa , i know an intimate little bistro with a fabulous view of the city .
perhaps dinner and an all night boat ride ?
well , i don' t really think that would be such a good idea
i hope i' m interrupting something .
volare , you know it' s not polite to drool in public .
roland , i haven' t seen you for weeks .
lillian , my pile of sweetness .
i' m so sorry .
i' ve been busy promoting our ballet at beauty pageants .
and then , of course , there' s my volunteer work at the breast implant clinic .
and how i missed you .
in fact , i missed you so much , two days ago i went out and i bought a woman who looks just like you .
oh , you silly .
for you .
from you .
another lovely bracelet .
i didn' t want this wrist to think i was neglecting it .
oh , roland ...
lillian , l
lazlo , i didn' t see you there .
i stand corrected .
i saw you , but i chose to ignore you .
lisa , my darling .
will you excuse us ?
two' s company and three' s an adult movie .
mrs. oglethorpe , may we start ?
oh , please .
is she a fox or what ?
ladies and gentlemen , for many weeks now the oglethorpe ballet company have been in rehearsal .
tomorrow we open with roberto volare' s interpretation of tears of the swan .
at this time , i wish to introduce to you the creative genius behind our company , the brightest light in the ballet firmament ...
thank you for those kind words , edmund lazlo .
i don' t know who does your hair , but tell me , where do they do it and when are they bringing it back ?
well , i had a speech all prepared , but today i' m going to speak from the heart .
you' ve no doubt asked yourself , " why has he been chosen for this task of running the oglethorpe ?
a man' s man .
but i like women a lot more .
my intimate views of jackie , cher , sean , larry , moe , curly .
over 200 pages of provocative pictures , and only one page has any writing on it .
act now and you can get one of these fabulous " flakfizer is ballet " t shirts .
mastercard and visas accepted .
that brings me to the task at hand , to introduce the woman i adore .
behind every great man is a woman .
and thank heaven i have lillian oglethorpe , because , quite frankly ,
i enjoy the shade .
dear lillian , soon i hope to take you on a caribbean cruise , where we can hold hands on a soft summer' s evening and watch that old jamaican moon .
why that old jamaican will be mooning us , i have no idea .
and now , here she is , the woman voted by her senior class
most likely to go up a few dress sizes , " a woman who would be a man , except her name is lillian ,
lillian oglethorpe .
thank you .
thank you .
hey .
hey , what' s with all the tears ?
this should be the happiest night of your life .
i know it should be .
it' s just that ... ... i miss alan so much .
well , i' d feel the same way if the man i loved was thousands of miles away .
of course , i' d be living a whole different lifestyle .
here , come with me .
i know just the thing to cheer you up .
if you just step right in here , my dear , your spirits might just brighten .
but that' s mr. volare' s dressing room .
of course .
he' s got the best champagne .
alan !
lisa .
flakfizer flew alan out to see you in the opening of the ballet .
it' s a formal affair .
do you have tuxedos ?
i got mine .
that' s great for tomorrow , but aren' t you a little overdressed for today ?
oh , no .
i' m very impressed .
i don' t have any luggage .
then this all makes sense .
i was worried there for a second .
mr. flakfizer , thank you .
i see you' re saving your best stuff for alan .
i think we should leave the lovers alone for a few minutes .
make that a few hours .
i missed you so much .
i don' t want us to be apart ever again .
i told you before !
oh , my god , it' s volare .
you better hide .
don' t hang my tight by the crotch !
it throws off my bulge !
yes , volare , i' m sorry .
lisa , what a pleasant surprise .
i see you decided to start our little party early , huh ?
roberto , you' ve got the wrong idea .
oh , no .
i think i' ve got the right idea .
roberto , stop it !
get your hands off of her !
you !
what are you doing here ?
mr. flakfizer flew me out .
you and mr. flakfizer are going to be sorry for this .
volare , what happened ?
it' s flakfizer .
he' s brought that performance artist out here .
hasn' t that information arrived yet ?
no , but we may not need it .
i have devised a little plan .
he' s staying at lillian' s townhouse .
all we have to do is make a few arrangements .
oh , no .
lillian ?
well , no one' s in .
roland .
this is just a business call .
i didn' t think you were back so soon .
roland .
lillian ... ... can' t we just be friends ?
why , you' re not lillian .
you gonna spank me ?
we can start there ... ... and see what happens .
are we alone ?
servants have the day off .
lillian is already at the theater , but i' m here .
take me .
okay .
let' s say two out of three falls .
no standing eight count .
wait .
i wanna make love by candlelight .
i could do you one better .
i think this is more in keeping with ... things to come .
not a bad little pad lillian' s got here .
was that the doorbell ?
that wasn' t you ?
never mind .
just ignore it .
well , it' s a big house .
maybe they can' t hear the bell .
let' s try this .
wait a minute .
i' il be right back .
if you need anything , there' s plenty of batteries in my room .
oh , let me try this .
good idea .
you go through the window .
if the alarm goes off , i' il run away so they won' t catch both of us .
we don' t want any !
oh , it' s you .
we have to talk .
it' s very important .
look .
the next half hour , give or take 29 minutes , will be very important for me , so thanks for dropping by .
yeah , but
flakfizer !
the face is familiar .
it' s mine .
and so it is .
say , if you ever visit this planet again , give me a call .
we' il have lunch .
flakfizer .
how come you didn' t knock ?
i' m using a better grade of gas .
that' s not bad , is it ?
you know , i always enjoy it when we get together , but i want you out , or i' il be forced to kill you .
i' il tell the police
i did it out of love .
flakie , aren' t you coming to bed ?
that' s a girl .
not just a girl , a way of life .
what if mrs. oglethorpe comes back ?
she' il have to wait her turn .
i saw tina first .
don' t you see ?
lazlo wants mrs. oglethorpe to catch you in bed with her !
oh , no !
mrs. oglethorpe !
i' ve been in situations like this before .
we act calm .
stay cool .
okay , okay .
tina leaves by the back door and no one is any the wiser .
it' s an old gary hart trick .
i' m not leaving till i' m satisfied .
you beast !
really has a such a nice light touch with women .
you big brute !
how dare you ...
get her out of sight !
no , no , no !
that' s lillian' s room .
in here .
in here .
not there !
she can' t be found there .
that' s my room .
i don' t know why you insist on returning to my home .
we can' t miss the final dress rehearsal of the ballet .
lillian , my dear , we can' t go without flakfizer .
i just thought it would make for a better appearance if we all arrive at the same time .
you have been looking at your watch all morning , edmund .
your behavior is most peculiar .
you big animal !
what was that ?
we must investigate !
edmund , what is this ?
you relentless sex stallion .
oh , great .
now she' s talking about me .
what was that ?
jacques , show her what will happen if she doesn' t shut up .
that came from your suite .
hide her !
my bedroom ?
ninety eight , 99 , 100 .
lillian , lazlo .
my two favorite l' s .
what on earth are you doing here at this ungodly hour ?
i know you' re up to something , flakfizer .
a snap inspection ?
roland .
what are you doing in my bedroom ?
this is your room ?
thank god .
i thought someone sewed up all my fly holes .
lazlo , how about the three of us going down to the kitchen
and making a big sandwich .
i hardly think so .
i' m going to check under the bed .
edmund !
what on earth has gotten into you ?
be more careful .
you did that on purpose .
you' re trying to conceal the fact that
your suite .
and i think you' re pretty terrific yourself .
you stay here .
there' s no telling what he may do in this crazed state !
lazlo .
i say , lazlo .
what are you looking for ?
a woman .
how about calling an escort service ?
i' m calling the police .
excuse me .
i' m so sorry .
forgive me .
i' m sorry .
the guest bedrooms .
roland .
all right .
get in .
get in .
roland , what is all the commotion ?
it' s lazlo .
i' ve never seen him like this .
quick , in here .
and while you' re in there , why don' t you make the bed .
i know she' s here somewhere .
lazlo !
what ?
what was that ?
i don' t know , but it came from in here .
edmund , this is outrageous .
i can explain .
he' s got a woman tied up .
edmund !
she looks dazed and drugged .
no .
he' s obviously the grand dragon of some sex slave cult .
and she looks like she' s about 1 5 .
no , no , no .
okay , 1 4 , then .
in fact , i know she' s 1 4 because i was dating her a year ago .
edmund , i want you out of my house this instant .
if i had to take a wild guess , i' d say you' re out of a job .
i hope there' s no hard feelings .
you know , lazlo , this is a good look for you .
flakfizer .
lazlo , are you decent ?
lillian .
quick , smelling salts !
and a crane , if you got one .
oh , my goodness .
you' ve done it now , lazlo .
i don' t feel a thing .
this woman is dead .
you' re holding his wrist .
then this man is dead .
mrs. oglethorpe is unconscious .
smelling salts , right away .
hello , excuse me , gentlemen ?
triple speed messenger service .
i got a message here for a guy named lazlo .
give me that .
this is a litany of fraudulent accident cases , bad debts and several police departments who would love to get their hands on you .
and when mrs. oglethorpe comes to , she will read this and she will have no course but to fire you !
quick , try some chloroform .
i' m taking lillian to the hospital .
you , help me get her to the car .
why don' t you take him along for a brain scan .
gently .
easy .
what are we gonna do now ?
what any flakfizer would do .
what , something devious and underhanded ?
you know the family .
if we don' t get that letter before lillian wakes up , we' re dead ducks .
multiple fractures ?
lucky day .
the name' s flakfizer .
no job too small , no fee too large .
if any limb falls off , mail it to me .
it can only strengthen our case .
roland t. flakfizer .
this is your lucky day .
this man' s dead .
then he won' t be needing this .
i' m almost all out of business cards .
excuse me .
what are you gentlemen doing here ?
we' re here to see mrs. lillian oglethorpe .
i' m afraid that' s not possible .
she' s on a private floor .
hospital personnel and doctors only .
hi .
ed breckerman , security .
there' s a mercedes on fire in the doctors ' parking lot .
when will mrs. oglethorpe regain consciousness ?
she' s under a sedative .
you' il have to ask the doctor .
you called ?
at last .
no letter here .
right , i' il carve .
dark meat or white ?
now , this is a very important woman .
i hope you know your business .
hey , so do we .
i wanna assure you we' ve been doctors
for many , many floors now .
you' re not the doctor i saw earlier .
he caught what she got .
we' re filling in .
she' s been out since she came here ?
yes .
and so she hasn' t been able
to read anything , then , huh ?
of course not .
good .
it will bring on complications .
not for her , necessarily ,
but complications nonetheless .
she' s coming to , doctor .
now we got complications .
she' s going out , doctor .
the crisis is over .
this is ludicrous .
i don' t think anyone will argue that point .
let the games begin .
it' s the first annual vasectomy bowl .
what is going on ?
a happy doctor is a good doctor .
what is the meaning of this ?
are you sure you' re a doctor ?
that' s gotta hurt .
at least , i hope it does .
doctor , we' il have to run a few tests .
table for one .
there you go .
ground transportation , courtesy of medicare .
you say ether and i say either ether , either
oh , please proceed .
i' m just checking on mrs. oglethorpe .
well , doctor ?
yes , doctor ?
yes , doctor ?
doctor .
doctor .
yes .
well , i thought we' il have to perform a full " rectumology .
an epidemic .
drop those pants .
not you , the patient .
i thought you were cardiologists .
they' re all connected .
we enter the rectum and head north .
why do you think we have such long instruments ?
x rays for dr. blazie .
i' il take those .
i deal in x rays .
i see you do too .
i used to work at las vegas general .
security to room 1 404 .
yeah .
hit me .
i' il play these .
read them and weep .
three hearts .
beats a pair of kidneys .
doctor , your diagnosis ?
difficult to tell from the negative .
it' s her liver .
looks more like veal to me .
what is this ?
an obstruction in the fourth lumbar .
huge backup in the lower intestine .
my advice is to avoid the intestine and plan an alternate route .
grab a left at the first major artery and get on the fifth lumbar heading south .
skeletal update every hour on the hour .
time for a thorough checkup .
it' s gotta be here somewhere .
the operation is a success !
success .
success .
doctors , we' re done here .
arrest those men .
come here .
come on , man .
what are you doing ?
come on .
come here .
stay still , all right ?
so you were the doctors .
no , we' re not them .
we' re someone else .
the three you' re looking for are our twin brothers .
you' il never see us together , because we love the same women .
that' s next on geraldo .
roland .
yes ?
what are you doing here ?
that' s a good question .
what am i doing here ?
lmpersonating a doctor , harassing a patient , altering medical records .
trespassing , destroying hospital property .
and don' t forget alan punching out volare .
whose side are you on anyway ?
give me that .
stealing private property .
it could happen to anyone .
society' s to blame .
too much violence in the movies .
it' s my environment .
we were carrying out orders !
it' s the japanese .
they' re buying up everything .
did we leave anything out ?
could i have a personalized number ?
is my hair okay ?
empty your pockets .
you can make one call .
hello , sportsline ?
steamer , hi .
this is rocco .
am i on the air ?
give me that .
be careful with that .
do you know who this man is ?
this is jackson pollock jr . , son of roy lichtenstein .
in a few years , this could be worth millions .
nobody knows the trouble i' ve seen
nobody knows my sorrow
what' s it all about , alfie ?
is it just for the moment we live ?
what' s it all about when you sort it out , alfie ?
in the jungle , the mighty jungle , the lion sleeps tonight
in the jungle , the quiet jungle , the lion sleeps tonight
hey .
you got visitors .
maybe it' s somebody
with a recording contract .
alan .
lisa .
you can go home , fellas .
you bribed a guard ?
i paid your bail .
how did you do that ?
i used my severance pay .
you have servants ?
no .
volare fired me .
it seems i wasn' t appreciative enough .
he can' t do that .
no , he' s done it , all right .
and now he' s dancing with lisa' s understudy .
the one with the large chest ?
there' s nobody in the company like that .
would be if i were running things .
this is terrible .
and volare' s vowed to blackball us from ever dancing for a major ballet company .
that' s not fair .
i know .
and it' s all my fault .
oh , it' s your fault , huh ?
alan , don' t talk that way .
why , i wouldn' t dance with volare if he were the last man on earth .
wait a minute .
just because you' re not in the ballet doesn' t mean you won' t dance tonight .
flakfizer' s right .
i don' t know why , but he' s right .
and i think it' s about time for alan to make his new york debut .
to the theater , and not a minute to lose !
break a leg , mr. volare .
grazie .
tina , darling .
break a leg , mr. volare .
grazie .
break a leg , mr. volare .
grazie .
five minutes , mr. volare .
five minutes ?
oh , my god .
what have i been doing ?
four minutes , mr. volare .
four minutes ?
three minutes , mr. jolson .
what' s going on here ?
where do you want these , mr. volare ?
anywhere .
just keep them out of my way .
all right .
come on .
hurry up .
get out of here .
go .
hey , you too .
you too .

where do you want these , mr. volare ?
what' s going on here ? !
how do i know ?
have you lost your mind ?
lobstergram for mr. volare .
lobstergram !
oh , there you are .
for he' s a jolly good fellow for he' s a jolly good fellow
for he' s a jolly good fellow
a masseuse !
lazlo !
mr. volare is coming .
places , please .
t onight is your night , my dear .
thanks to you , edmund .
after the performance ,
i will announce you as the sole director of our ballet company .
if i do say so myself , the ballet is in good hands .
how could i ever have trusted someone as nefarious as roland flakfizer ?
i don' t wish to hear his name mentioned ever again .
edmund .
it' s those idiots !
i will put a stop to this .
good evening , ballet fans .
we' ve got a good one .
another big league ballet battle starring that plucky roberto " bulldog " volare .
and what a great night for a ballet it is .
the sky is clear , the wind is blowing from left to right , which means the ballerinas should be flying out of here .
and here we go .
volare does a pirouette , another pirouette .
a skip , a leap .
he spins .
he scores !
listen to that crowd !
it' s him !
we return you now to your regularly scheduled program .
come here .
get the police now !
hi .
get out !

hold it .
the great volare ?
bon voyage .
no !
all right , yeah .

ballet history .
when do we go on ?
i' d say right about now .
there they are !
arrest those men !
don' t let them get away !
oh , boy .
i will never work for the oglethorpe ballet again !
will you put that in writing ?
this evening could ruin my career !
at least we' re thinking along the same lines .
i must explain to my public this is all your doing .
they' re trying to tell you something .
i quit !
that' s what they' re trying to tell you .
officers , take these people away .
oh , my god , he' s got a gun !
the man' s insane .
he could use a gift certificate to the betty ford center .
we' il have lunch right after the lobotomy .
always remember , nobody likes you .
bravo !
bravo !
wonderful .
wonderful !
we' re a hit !
go on , get back out there .
get back out there .
listen to that crowd !
you' re a ballet legend .
and you' re not even dead yet .
oh , roland , i' m so glad i trusted you .
rest assured , my darling , i will never leave your side again .
what' s that ?
nothing .
hey , what happened ?
i got an idea .
hey , big boy .

yes .
oh , boy .
curtain' s going up !
curtain' s going up !
a big broadway opening .
everybody who' s anybody in new york is here tonight .
everybody but one man .
this man .
me .
where are you going ?
didn' t you direct this ?
i just have to ...
one or two things .
get out of this theatre !
is anything wrong with your seat ?
it' s facing the stage !
it' s going to be a disaster .
i can' t just sit there and watch .
five seconds and we still haven' t got a laugh .
i' m not running away .
i just don' t like watching a car crash .
particularly when it' s mine .
it' s going to be a catastrophe .
they' il forget their lines .
we won' t get out of new york alive .
there' s pictures of us in the lobby .
i' il get on a plane .
i should have done when we opened in des moines , before we opened , at the dress rehearsal , as soon as the curtain went up .
as soon as the damned phone rang and dotty came on with the sardines .
hold on !
hold your horses !
oh , lord love a duck !
shut up !
i' m on my way .
it' s no good you going on .
i can' t open sardines and answer the phone .
i' ve only got one pair of feet .
hello ?
yes , but there' s no one here , love ...
no , mr brent' s not here .
he lives here , yes , but not now because he lives in spain .
yes , philip brent , who writes plays , only now he writes them in spain .
she' s in spain , too .
they all are .
am i in spain ?
no , i' m not in spain .
i look after the house for them .
only i go home at one on wednesdays , so that' s where i am .
no , because i' ve got a nice plate of sardines to put my feet up with .
and they' ve got colour here , and it' s the royal ... you know , the horse race .
where' s the paper ?
if it' s about letting the house , you' il have to ring the house agents .
squire , squire , hackham and ...
who' s the other one ?
no , they' re next to the phone in the study .
squire , squire , hackham and ...
hold on !
i' il go and look .
as soon as you take the weight off your feet , down it all comes on your head .
and i take the sardines ...

you leave the sardines and you hang up the phone .
yes , right .
i hang up the phone .

i hang up the phone and i leave the sardines ?
right !
we' ve changed that , have we , dear ?
no , dear .
that' s what i' ve always been doing ?
i wouldn' t say that , dotty .
how about the words ?
am i getting some of them right ?
some of them have a very familiar ring .
it' s like a slot machine up here .
i know that .
i never know what' s going to come out : three oranges or two lemons and a banana .
anyway , it' s not midnight yet , and we don' t open till tomorrow .
you' re holding the receiver .
right .
squire , squire , hackham and ... hold on ! " and noises off .
squire , squire , hackham ...
hold on !
hanging up the phone .
put your feet up for two minutes and they come running after you .
hold it !
this is her afternoon off .

sorry .
don' t worry .
it' s just the tech .
it' s the dress , garry .
when was the tech ?
when' s the dress ?
we open tomorrow .
we' re thinking of it as the tech .
it' s the words .
don' t worry about the words .
and that accent .
it' s like oranges and lemons .
your words are fine .
better than the ... you know ?
isn' t that right ?
sorry ?
i mean , ok , he' s the ...
but , dotty , you' ve been playing this kind of part for , well , i mean ...

sorry ?
garry , you' re off .
sorry , lloyd , but ... you know ?
i know .
thanks , lloyd .
so you' re off ...
lloyd , let me just say one thing .
i' ve known many directors , some geniuses , some bastards , but i' ve never met one who was so totally ... i don' t know .
thank you , garry , i' m very touched .
now get off the fucking stage .
and brooke ?
yes ?
are you in ?
in ?
are you there ?
what ?
you' re out .
ok , i' il call again .
and on we go .
so , there you are , holding the receiver .
i hold the receiver .
i hang it up .
i leave the sardines .
always the same story ...
and you take the newspaper .
i take the newspaper .
i leave the sardines .
a weight off your mind , a load off your stomach .
and off i go at last .
leaving the receiver .
my housekeeper , yes , but ...
and noises off .
stage !
this is her afternoon off , so we' ve got the place to ourselves .
wow !
i' il just check .
hello ?
anyone at home ?
there' s no one here .
what do you think ?
great !
it' s all yours ?
just a shack in the woods .
converted mill , 1 6th century .
must have cost a bomb .
ideal for business .
someone' s coming at 4 . 00 .
arab .
oil .
i' ve got to get those files to basingstoke by 4 . 00 .
we' il just manage to fit it in ...

we won' t chill the champagne .
all these doors !
just a handful .
study , kitchen and housekeeper' s flat .
which one' s the ... you know ?
oh , through here .
fantastic !
now i' ve lost the sardines .
i thought no one was here .
i' m not .
only it' s the royal ...
the race where they wear those hats .
who are you ?
from squire , squire , hackham and dudley .
which one are you , then ?
i' m tramplemain .
i thought you were a burglar .
i just dropped in to go into a few things ...
check some measurements ...
do one or two odd jobs .
oh , and i' ve got a prospective tenant .
what' s wrong with this door ?
her interest is aroused .
that' s not the bedroom .
no , that' s the downstairs bathroom and wc .
the housekeeper , mrs crockett .
clackett , dear .
she' s not here .
it' s the royal .
it' s black and white at home .
don' t worry about us .
we' il just inspect the house .
now i' ve lost the newspaper .
sardines !

we' re not angry at you , poppy .
i' m happy with the sardines if you are , hon .
i' m happy if you are .
garry , what are you saying ?

she' s been in the family for generations .
come on .
i' ve got to be in basingstoke by 4 . 00 .
perhaps just some champagne ?
upstairs .
and bring my files .
only ...
what ?
her ?
she has been here for generations .
sardines , sardines ...
it' s not for me to say , but i will say this : take the plunge , you' il enjoy it here .
won' t she ?
yes , well ...
we' il enjoy having you , won' t we ?
terrific !
sardines ...
can' t put your feet up on an empty stomach .
she thinks it' s great .
she' s making us sardines .
she' s terrific .
terrific .
so , which way ?
all right .
before she comes back with the sardines .
up here ?
in here ?
yes , yes , yes .
another bathroom .
you always try to get me in the bathrooms !
i mean in here .
ooh !
black sheets !
that' s the linen closet .
this one , this one !
you' re in a real state .
can' t even get the door open .
it' s mrs clackett' s afternoon off .
hold it !
look at it !
hold it !
and god said , " hold it !
and they held it .
and god saw that it was terrible .
the door won' t open .
this door won' t close .
and god said , " poppy !
you know i' m stupid about doors .
you' re doing perfectly .
as long as i didn' t break it .
and there was poppy .
and god said ,
be fruitful and multiply and fetch tim to fix the doors .
i love tech rehearsals !
she loves tech rehearsals !
isn' t she , just ...
where' s dotty ?
everyone' s always so nice .
belinda' s being all , you know ?
freddy , don' t you like an all night tech ?
only because you can sit on the furniture .
it' s good to see you making jokes .
oh , was that a joke ?
this is such a nice company to work with .
broadway in six months !
cleveland in three !
all right , lloyd ?
i know what god felt like when he sat in the dark , creating the world .
what did he feel like ?
pleased he' d taken his valium .
he had six days .
we' ve only got six hours .
and god said , " where the hell is tim ?
and there was tim .
and god said , " let there be doors that open and close .
do something ?
i was getting the bananas .
doors !
i bet god had a stage manager who understood english , too .
that door won' t close .
and the bedroom won' t , you know ?
he hasn' t been to bed for 48 hours .
don' t worry !
only another 24 hours .
look , he' s come down to earth amongst us .
listen , since we' ve stopped ...
it took two days to do the set , so we shan' t have time for a dress rehearsal .
don' t worry .
think of the first night as the dress .
if we can just get through tonight for doors and sardines .
it' s all about doors and sardines , getting on and off , getting the sardines on and off .
that' s farce .
that' s the theatre .
that' s life .
oh , god , lloyd .
you' re so deep .
so just keep going .
bang !
bang !
bang !
bang , you' re on !
bang , you' ve said it !
bang , you' re off !
where' s selsdon ?
oh , god !
selsdon !
poppy !
i thought he was out front .
is mr mowbray in his dressing room ?
would he , during a tech ?
would who ?
selsdon .
he wouldn' t during a tech .
half a chance , he would .
what ?
be fair .
let' s not jump to conclusions .
get the understudy .
tim !
yes ?
hurry up with the doors .
you' re going on for selsdon .
he should never have been let out of our sight .
i said that .
he' s been good in rehearsals .
in the rehearsal hall , it was all ... you know ?
you could see everyone .
here , there' s a front and a back and we' ve lost him .
he' s not in his dressing room .
bathroom ?
prop room ?
paint shop ?
call the police !
doors finished ?
get the gear on !
i' m sorry , dotty , my precious .
no , it' s my fault .
i cast him .
i said , " give him one last chance .
we did summer stock together when i was a kid .
it' s my fault , sweetheart .
this tour is her life savings .
we know that , garry .
i' m not out to make my fortune .
i just wanted to put something away .
we know .
a little house .
it' s not much to ask .
don' t blame yourself .
sorry ?
don' t cry .
i' ve got something behind my lens .
it' s not brooke' s fault .
he was right there before we started .
who ?
it' s all right .
we know you can' t see .
you mean selsdon ?
i' m not blind .
i can see selsdon .
selsdon !
he' s here !
standing there like hamlet' s father .
we thought you were ... not there .
where have you been ?
are you all right ?
speak to us .
is it a party ?
is it a party ?
is it ?
how killing !
i thought there was going to be a rehearsal .
i was having a post prandial snooze so as to be ready for the rehearsal .
isn' t he lovely ?
now we can see him .
what are we celebrating ?
what are we celebrating ?
tim , you look strained and anxious .
i can' t find the gear .
i' ve looked in his wardrobe ...
oh .
beer ?
in the wardrobe ?
no , selsdon .
you need a break .
why don' t you sit down and do the payroll ?
i' il do the bananas first .
he' s been up for 48 hours .
and don' t fall down , tim .
we may not be insured .
what' s next ?
i thought we might try a rehearsal .
i won' t , thank you .
you won' t ?
no , i' il watch .
is this the beer in the wardrobe ?
no , he wants to rehearse .
but shouldn' t we rehearse ?
i knew you' d think of something .
from belinda and freddy' s entrance .
what' s happened now ?
the police .
they' ve found an old man in a doorway .
thank you .
they say he' s dirty and smelly .
i thought , " oh , my god ! " because when you get close to selsdon ...
poppy !
no , if you stand anywhere near him , you can' t help noticing this very distinctive ...
i tell you , poppy , once you get it in your nostrils , you never forget it .
sixty years now , and the smell of the theatre still haunts me .
bless him !
poppy , how did you get a job like this that requires tact ?
you' re not somebody' s girlfriend ?
don' t worry .
he did not hear .
not here ?
yes , there .
go to sleep .
you' re not on for 20 pages .
i might go back to sleep .
i' m not on for 20 pages .
on we go .
dotty in the kitchen with sardines .
garry and brooke on the stairs , freddy and belinda waiting outside , time sliding into the past .
aren' t they sweet ?
garry and dotty .
you mean , they' re ... ?
it' s supposed to be a secret .
but she' s old enough to be ... !
didn' t you know ?
i' m just god .
i don' t know anything .
what' s happening ?
you tell me .
what are we waiting for ?
her 1 8th birthday ?
or maybe just the cue .
brooke !
you can' t even get the door open .
you can' t even get the door open .
door closed , garry , love !
you can' t even get the door open .
we' ve got the place entirely to ourselves .
look at it !
i can' t believe it !
a perfect place for an assignation !
home .
our secret hideaway .
the last place anyone will look .
it' s funny creeping in .
if the inland revenue find out , bang goes our claim to be resident abroad , bang goes most of this year' s income .
i wonder if mrs clackett' s aired the beds .
darling !
why not ?
no children , no friends .
we' re on our own .
true .
there is something to be said for being a tax exile .
leave those !
shh !
the inland revenue may hear us .
what i did with that first lot of sardines i shall never know .
mrs clackett !
my heart jumped out of my boots !
so did mine .
i thought you were in spain .
we are .
we' re not here .
the income tax are after you ?
they would be if they knew .
all right , love .
you' re not here .
i haven' t seen you .
off to bed , are you ?
well ...
nowhere like bed when it all gets on top of you .
you' il want your things .
yes .
that bed isn' t aired .
i' il get a hot water bottle .
all your letters are in the study .
you forward them , don' t you ?
not the ones from the income tax .
oh , my god !
where are they ?
in the little pigeon house , dear .
in the pigeon house ?
i could hear voices .
what sort of voices ?
hold it !
what' s the trouble ?
you know how stupid i am about moves .
sorry .
why do i take the things into the study ?
shouldn' t i leave them ?
no .
i thought it might be more logical .
no .
i know it' s late in the day , but ...
no , several minutes before we open .
as long as we' re not too rushed .
why does he carry the bag and groceries into the study ?
they have to be out of the way .
i see that .
and selsdon needs them in the study .
where is selsdon ?
is he there ?
selsdon !
selsdon !
am i on ?
no , no .
i thought i heard my voice .
no .
go back to sleep .
you' re not on for 10 pages .
i see all that .
oh , no .
but why ?
why does anyone do anything ?
why does that other idiot go out with sardines ?
i' m not getting at you .
of course not .
jesus , why do i ?
who knows ?
who knows ?
the wellsprings of human action are deep and cloudy .
maybe something happened when you were a small child that made you frightened to let go of groceries .
it could be genetic .
or ... you know .
it could be .
i understand all that ...
i' m telling you i don' t know .
i don' t think the author knows .
i don' t know why the author came into this industry .
or any of us .
if you could just give me a reason .
all right .
i' il give you a reason .
you carry them into the study because it' s slightly after midnight and we' re not going to be finished before we open tomorrow .
correction .
before we open tonight !
and on we go , from after freddy' s exit , with groceries .
lloyd , sweetheart , his wife left him this morning .
oh .
freddy ?
i think the point is , you had a great fright when she mentions income tax and you felt insecure and exposed and you wanted something familiar to hold on to .
thank you , lloyd .
bless you !
and on we merrily go .
yes , but i could hear voices .
yes , but i could hear voices .
what voices ?
people' s !
no one' s here .
i saw the door handle move .
must you put your tie on to look ?
mrs clockett .
she' s been here for generations .
look , she' s opened our sardines .
you can' t go down like that .
why not ?
mrs crackett .
she' s irreplaceable .
sardines here , sardines there !
it' s like a sunday school outing .
you still poking around ?
yes , still poking .
still around .
in the linen closet ?
no , no !
yes , just checking the sheets , going through the inventory .
mrs blackett ...
clackett .
is there anyone else in the house ?
no one .
i thought i heard voices .
no voices here .
i must have imagined it .
oh , my god !
i beg your pardon !
oh , my god !
why ?
what is it ?
oh , my god !
the study door' s open .
oh , my god !
there' s another car outside .
that' s not mr hackham' s , is it ?
nothing but flapping doors in this house .
final notice , steps will be taken , foreclosure , proceedings in court ...
a gentleman come about the house .
i' m not here .
he' s got a lady quite aroused .
leave it to the agents .
shall i let them go all over ?
anything , but don' t tell anyone we' re here .
i' il just sit down and ...
sardines !
i' ve forgotten the sardines .
if it wasn' t fixed to my shoulders , i' d forget what day it was .
i didn' t get this .
i' m in spain .
if i didn' t get it , i didn' t open it .
did i have a dress like this ?
i shouldn' t buy anything this tarty .
did you give me it ?
never should have touched it !
stick it down !
never saw it !
i' il put it in the attic with your other precious gifts .
all right .
now the study door' s open again .
what' s going on ?
knocking !
upstairs .
oh , my god !
there' s something in the linen closet .
oh , it' s you !
of course it' s me .
you put me in there with the black sheets .
why did you lock the door ?
why did you ?
i didn' t !
someone did .
we can' t stand here ... in your underwear .
ok , i' il take it off .
in here !
this glue isn' t the sort you can never get unstuck , is it ?
hold it !
mrs clackett' s made us sardines .
we have a problem .
which one this time ?
left .
it' s the left one .
left one !
left one !
could be anywhere .
could have bounced .
where did you last see it ?
it was in her eye .
she opens her eyes very ... don' t you ?
i feel i should rush forward .
careful where you put your feet .
everyone look under their feet .
no one move their feet !
put your feet back where they were !
pick up your feet one at a time .
brooke , is this going to happen during a performance ?
she' il keep going .
can she see ?
can she hear without them ?
sorry ?
oh , sorry !
you stepped on his hand !
oh , look at freddy , the poor thing !
what' s the matter ?
nose bleed .
no one touched him .
violence makes his nose bleed .
sorry .
i thought you spoke to me .
hit the manager with this to finish off theatre in des moines .
anyway , i' ve found it .
where ?
in my eye .
nice going .
your left eye ?
yes .
round the side .
i knew it hadn' t gone far .
ok ?
i think so .
clear the stage .
walking wounded carry stretcher cases .
all right , freddy ?
i just have a thing about ...
we understand .
on we bloodily stagger .
freddy , i' il rephrase that .
on we blindly stumble .
brooke , i withdraw that .
anyway ...
where' s selsdon ?
selsdon !
selsdon !
she might have dropped it out here .
good .
keep looking .
only another five pages , selsdon .
anyway , we can' t stand here ... in your underwear .
ok , i' il take it off .
darling , this isn' t the sort of glue that never comes unstuck , is it ?
oh , mrs clackett' s made us sardines .
now what ?
a hot water bottle .
i didn' t put it there .
i didn' t .
someone in the bathroom filling it .
is something creepy going on ?
darling , are you coming to bed ?
what did you say ?
nothing .
the door handle , the hot water bottle ...
i' ve got goose pimples .
get something on .
under the covers .
what did i do with the sardines ?
you hear funny things about old houses .
but this one has been modernised .
nothing creepy could survive ...
what ?
what is it ?
what' s happening ?
the sardines !
they' ve gone !
there is something funny going on .
i' m going to put my head under the ...
i put them there .
bag !
mrs sprockett must have taken them away .
bag !
what ?
what is it ?
bag !
bag !
what do you mean ?
bag !
bag !
what bag ?
no bag !
your bag suddenly here , now gone !
it' s in the bedroom .
don' t go in there !
the box !
they' ve both gone .
my files !
what' s happening ?
wait here !
no !
get dressed !
i' m not going in there .
i' il fetch your dress .
your dress has gone .
don' t panic !
don' t panic !
there' s some rational explanation .
mrs splodgett will tell us .
you wait here .
no , you can' t stand here like that .
wait in the study .
study , study !
roger , there' s something in there .
where are you ?
i know this is going to sound silly , but ...
i' m going to clear out the attic .
i' m glued to a tax demand .
why don' t you put the sardines down ?
i' m stuck to the sardines .
get that bottle marked " poison " .
it eats through anything .
i' ve heard of people being stuck with a problem , but this is ridiculous !
selsdon !
you' re on , selsdon !
we' re there .
the moment' s arrived .
it' s all right .
he' s coming .
the arm should have come through .
ah !
here it comes .
no bars , no burglar alarms .
they should be ...
hold it , selsdon .
let' s take it again .
hold it , selsdon !
hold it !
lloyd wants you to hold it .
stop , selsdon !
my god !
like the band playing on as the titanic sank .
stop ?
thank you .
selsdon ...
my dad was nearly on the titanic .
he can hear better than i can .
from your entrance .
it was before the war , so ...
thank you .
poppy !
no .
stops me sleeping .
put the glass back .
come on again ?
right , only sooner .
like yesterday .
freddy !
start when freddy opens the door .
what' s the line ?
i' ve heard of getting stuck with a problem .
start moving on , " i' ve heard of getting stuck with a problem .
i want your arm through the window , right ?
may i make one suggestion ?
what ?
would it perhaps be better if i came on earlier ?
only there' s a hiatus between freddy' s exit and my entrance .
no , selsdon , listen .
yeah ?
i' ve got it .
what ?
come on a little earlier .
we' re thinking along the same lines .
am i putting him on or vice versa ?
freddy , from your exit .
i' ve heard of getting stuck with a problem , but this is ridiculous .
no bars , no burglar alarms .
they should be prosecuted for incitement .
it makes me weep when i think i used to do banks , bullion vaults .
what am i doing now ?
breaking into paper bags .
i know they' re in spain because the old turkey in the kitchen said so .
and i saw her go out in her swimming costume .
get the van loaded .
no rush .
only got all flaming afternoon .
what have they got to offer ?
one microwave oven .
# 50 .
hardly worth lifting it .
cor !
come here !
junk , junk , junk !
well , yes , if you insist .
now , where' s his desk ?
they all say the same thing : it' s hard to adjust to retirement .
the prospective tenant wishes to know of any history of the paranormal .
yes , everything' s nice and paranormal here .
has anything ever dematerialised or flown about ?
no , things move on their own two feet , just like in any house .
i' il tell the prospective tenant .
she' s inspecting the study .
