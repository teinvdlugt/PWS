1
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,742
Good Lord.

2
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,584
Andy,

3
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,920
I want this dusted for prints.

4
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,840
No one saw a thing.

5
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,009
The blackout and the fire
drew everyone out of the building.

6
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,595
- How long has he been dead?
- It's hard to say.

7
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,264
We'll need an autopsy.

8
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:24,560
Doc, if you lift up the victim's shirt,
I believe you'll find a stab wound,

9
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,311
one inch beneath the sternum,

10
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,857
penetrating upwards,
severing the aorta.

11
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,367
You've seen this before.

12
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,497
- Yeah.
- Any traces?

13
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,500
No blood stains.

14
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,421
What's this?

15
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,343
- Douglas fir, Harry?
- Lodgepole pine.

16
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,597
Hawk, footprints?

17
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:05,184
Two sets, same boots,
one coming, one leaving.

18
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,394
Heavier impressions
on the way down.

19
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,229
Carrying the body.

20
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:13,525
Coop, are you sure
Windom Earle's behind this?

21
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:24,536
A short time ago, a vagrant,

22
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,706
our victim, was befriended
and offered a lift.

23
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,459
He was driven to a location
up beyond the ridge.

24
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:34,630
The car will still be there.
He was stabbed once.

25
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,175
He managed to run a short distance
before collapsing.

26
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,344
Windom Earle
engineered the explosion

27
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,305
that caused the power outage.

28
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,935
He created a diversionary fire
that drew everyone out of the station.

29
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,938
Brought the body in
through this window.

30
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,901
Windom Earle
has been in this room.

31
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,695
I can still feel his presence.

32
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,866
Harry, we're not gonna find
any fingerprints in here.

33
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,119
No mistakes. No slip-ups.

34
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,538
Everything has its own rationale,

35
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,708
precision, intelligence.

36
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,212
Windom Earle is a genius.

37
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,800
And he's taken his first pawn
in a very sick game.

38
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,611
Listen carefully, Bobby Briggs.
This is what we're gonna do.

39
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,031
If there's one thing I learned from
my father before he flipped his wig,

40
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,035
it's that a business relationship
is like a sacred pact.

41
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,372
Equaled only by the closest
of personal relationships,

42
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,750
where nothing is held back.

43
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,627
Right.

44
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,840
Do you wanna get rich, Bobby?

45
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,512
- Immediately.
- Well, maybe I can help.

46
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,684
Let's pretend that this is my father.

47
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,687
- An ice cube?
- Right.

48
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,191
And our job now is to help
my father come back from limbo land

49
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:23,947
before he melts away and leaves us
with a handful of nothing.

50
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,244
We wouldn't want that to happen,
would we?

51
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,787
No.

52
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:38,128
So from now on, Bobby,
I'm the one you suck up to.

53
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,841
- What about Shelly?
- What about Shelly?

54
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,144
Leo.

55
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:24,257
Leo?

56
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,773
No.

57
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,068
No.

58
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,071
Help me!

59
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,616
Please! Help me!

60
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,371
No! No!

61
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,838
Leo? Please.

62
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,119
Bad girl.

63
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,205
Please, please don't.

64
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,012
No!

65
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,858
I swear. I'll kill you.

66
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,116
Help me! Help!

67
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,838
Shelly?

68
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,760
Shelly.

69
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,387
Shelly, come on.

70
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,521
No. No!

71
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,320
- No!
- Shelly?

72
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,323
No, no, Leo.

73
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,783
Shelly!

74
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,369
- Shelly!
- No, please.

75
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,830
- No!
- Leo, you bastard!

76
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,502
Goodbye, wife.

77
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,092
Shelly.

78
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,010
Leo!

79
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,208
Goodbye.

80
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,752
- No!
- Aah!

81
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:02,183
Bobby! Bobby.

82
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,563
Everything's okay, baby.

83
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,772
He's gone.

84
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,612
- Here.
- Thanks, Harry.

85
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,657
Well, no fibers, no prints.
You were right.

86
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,744
If it is Earle, he didn't miss a beat.

87
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:07,165
Mm. Did you hear anything
from Denise?

88
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,835
The Bureau and the DEA cleared me
of all criminal charges.

89
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,921
The suspension still stands.

90
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,632
I'm waiting to hear from Gordon.

91
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,385
In the meantime,
you're still my deputy.

92
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,011
Mm-hm.

93
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,641
If you want this case, it's yours.

94
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,312
Harry, I want it.

95
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,484
Harry.

96
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:38,196
I found that car on the logging road
just like he said.

97
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,948
No prints.

98
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,034
And just so you know, Hank Jennings
didn't make the buy at Dead Dog

99
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,245
because he was in the hospital.

100
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,746
Claims he was hit by a bus.

101
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:52,252
I cuffed him to the bed
and booked him for parole violations.

102
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,588
Oh. Shelly Johnson called.

103
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,382
She said Leo came to last night,

104
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,677
attacked her
and ran off into the woods.

105
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,596
Holy smokes.

106
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,580
Lucy, we need to talk.
It's about Nicky.

107
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,207
Little Nicky?

108
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,169
Dick and I have been doing
some thinking and some looking,

109
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,922
and we think he's a... He's a...

110
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,637
A what?

111
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,974
We think he murdered his parents.

112
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,061
- He's 9 years old.
- I know.

113
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,983
We think he was 6
at the time of the crime.

114
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,737
I met little Nicky.
I've talked to little Nicky.

115
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,948
If you two think for one second

116
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:09,829
that I'll believe that a defenseless
little orphan is capable of murder,

117
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:14,209
the both of you aren't fit
to be fathers to a chimp.

118
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,544
Ow!

119
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,256
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this
right away.

120
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,036
Hello, you must be James.

121
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,246
- Um...
- Oh. Ha, ha.

122
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,956
I'm Jeffrey Marsh.

123
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:56,125
I've been hearing very good things
about your work from Evelyn.

124
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,962
Well, you'll see how it is
when you take it out.

125
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,215
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's lucky we found you.

126
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,551
No, my luck.

127
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,011
I hear you were, uh, on the road.

128
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,264
Yeah, I will be soon.

129
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,892
Ah, no itinerary, no deadlines.
I'm envious.

130
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,185
Wish I was going with you.

131
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,648
Maybe after I take her for a spin,
we'll talk shop.

132
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,484
Sounds like we have a mutual love:

133
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,155
Cars.

134
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:29,200
Yeah, well,
actually I'm kind of overdue as it is.

135
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,202
Of course he'll stay.

136
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,830
There are plenty of things
I could find for him to do.

137
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,582
Uh...

138
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,667
Right, James?

139
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,628
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

140
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,630
Excuse me.

141
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,260
- Nice kid.
- He's done a fine job on the car.

142
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,305
Mm. Let's see what it will do
on the open road.

143
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,348
Goodbye, Jeffrey.

144
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,958
Doc, it's Nadine I wanna talk about.

145
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,377
Nadine wants to start dating boys

146
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,004
and I don't know what to say.

147
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,215
Is she sexually active?

148
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,676
Active?

149
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:32,805
Doc, I wake up every morning feeling
like I've been hit by a timber truck.

150
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,393
It's the extra adrenaline.

151
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,562
Well, it's downright dangerous.

152
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,191
She's liable to kill a young kid.
I don't know what to say.

153
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,693
Be patient.

154
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:50,573
And, uh, tell her to be home
by 9:00 on school nights.

155
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,873
Extra potatoes.

156
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,500
Well, thanks.

157
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,468
Ed, uh, Donna took the van
this morning.

158
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,096
Said something
about looking for James.

159
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,140
Is there anything
I need to worry about?

160
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,811
Well, James is out west
a couple of hours.

161
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,564
Trying to clear his head, I think.
Donna's taking him some money.

162
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,360
Not easy being a parent, is it?

163
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,529
Boy, I'll say.

164
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,449
Well...

165
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,870
- See you, Ed.
- Thanks, doc.

166
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,087
Hank's in the hospital.

167
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,214
He said a tree fell on him.

168
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,926
Honey, that tree was a redwood
called Nadine.

169
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,970
Yesterday after you left,
Hank jumped me.

170
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,680
Right in my own living room.

171
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,807
If Nadine hadn't shown up...

172
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,767
Nadine took out Hank?

173
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,353
Phew. And it wasn't pretty.

174
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,401
Harry called. He said he'll be arresting
Hank for parole violation.

175
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,987
When Hank gets well,
he may have to go back to prison.

176
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,533
I think it's time I start correcting
a few of the mistakes I've made.

177
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,663
Well, we could, uh,
start by getting a cabin.

178
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:25,710
A couple of venison steaks
and a bottle of sparkling wine.

179
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,170
People will find out.

180
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,256
Let them.

181
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,614
- Don't you knock?
- I'm sorry.

182
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,283
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

183
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,996
You were good with Jeffrey.

184
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,457
It didn't feel that good.

185
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,296
I can change that.

186
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,552
It's wrong.

187
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,181
Love isn't wrong, James.

188
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,188
Please don't leave me.

189
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,565
Don't leave me alone with him.

190
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,952
What a shot!

191
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,581
I'm gonna go check my bike.

192
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,941
So how does chess
figure into all this?

193
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:17,989
Because Windom Earle and I played
a game every day for three years.

194
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,366
He felt that all of life

195
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,162
could be found in the patterns
and conflicts on the board.

196
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,665
Because I never beat him.

197
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,253
Now it's my turn.

198
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:37,508
I'll publish my response
in the Twin Peaks Gazette.

199
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,136
I don't know what else to do.

200
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:45,057
Coop, you're gonna have to give me
some more information here.

201
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,646
Harry, I've brought some baggage
to town I haven't told you about.

202
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,405
Windom Earle was my first partner.

203
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,159
Everything I know about the law
and the Bureau, I owe to him.

204
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,245
Four years ago,
we drew the assignment

205
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,790
of protecting a material witness
in a federal crime.

206
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:17,006
She was a very beautiful,
very gentle woman.

207
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,468
Her name was Caroline.

208
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,970
She and I fell in love.

209
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:33,105
One night, I failed in my vigilance.

210
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:36,776
An attack was made. I wasn't ready.

211
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,946
I was wounded
and I lost consciousness.

212
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:44,325
When I came to,
she was in my arms.

213
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,453
She was dead.
She'd been stabbed.

214
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,458
The wounds on the vagrant?

215
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,336
Identical.

216
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,006
The killer was never found.

217
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,385
My wound healed,
Windom Earle went mad.

218
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,179
Institutionalized
until his recent escape.

219
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,848
So why is he after you?

220
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,142
Harry,

221
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,561
Caroline was Windom Earle's wife.

222
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,825
So he blames you for her death.

223
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,207
It's much worse than that.

224
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,876
I think he killed her.

225
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,673
And I think he committed the crime
that she originally witnessed.

226
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,345
Harry, Windom Earle's mind
is like a diamond.

227
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:51,017
It's cold and hard and brilliant.

228
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,062
I think he feigned the insanity
that sent him away.

229
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,815
But at some point,
he lost the ability to distinguish

230
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,943
between what's right
and what's wrong.

231
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:07,199
You don't know
what he's capable of, Harry.

232
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,536
You don't know.

233
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,224
Coffee, please.

234
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,821
I'm looking for a biker
named James.

235
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,994
You look like someone
in need of help.

236
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,255
I'm looking for someone.

237
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,424
What's his name?

238
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,511
James.

239
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,472
James Hurley?

240
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,728
Yeah.

241
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,314
You know him?

242
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,441
He did some work for me recently.

243
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,276
What kind of work?

244
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,987
He fixed my husband's car.

245
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,283
Where is he?

246
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,537
He left. Yesterday, on his bike.

247
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,789
Where did he go?

248
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,668
He said something about the ocean.
Mexico, I think.

249
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,796
That's all?

250
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,048
Are you
what he's running away from?

251
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,512
Look, dear, why don't you go home?

252
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,639
He'll be back.

253
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,273
Coffee's on me.

254
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,377
He's marching on Washington.

255
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,255
We think he's getting close.

256
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,426
- Ben?
- He prefers general.

257
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,435
General.

258
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,190
Jeb.

259
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,527
He thinks you're General Jeb Stuart.

260
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,863
Oh. You're in the cavalry.

261
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:39,203
Jeb, there is a great day upon us.

262
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:46,210
By dawn, our troops will be
on the outskirts of Washington.

263
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,921
By midday, it will fall.

264
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:55,719
And we will once again walk
on our cherished fields at home.

265
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,564
Only God can stop us now.

266
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:10,776
And it is my firm belief, Jeb,

267
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,655
that the Almighty is a Southerner.

268
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:21,287
Hallelujah.

269
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:25,291
You really think it's a good idea
for Ben to be carrying this sword?

270
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,711
Well, uh, he thinks he's on a
forced march to Washington.

271
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,297
You know, he's crossing
the Maryland border as we speak.

272
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,924
What he's doing is quite healthy.

273
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,428
I mean, by reversing
the South's defeat in the Civil War,

274
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:41,056
he, in turn, will reverse
his own emotional setback.

275
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,559
What he needs right now
is both your understanding

276
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,894
and a Confederate victory.

277
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,396
Men of the South,

278
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,941
from this day
to the ending of the earth,

279
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,153
we who fight
shall be remembered.

280
00:26:55,488 --> 00:27:00,492
For our bravery,
for the battle scars that we bear.

281
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,912
We few...

282
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,168
We happy few.

283
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,758
We band of brothers,

284
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,886
onwards to Washington.

285
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:24,141
Oh, I wish I was
In the land of cotton

286
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,977
Old time there I've not forgotten

287
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:32,941
Look away, look away
Look away, Dixie land

288
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:38,739
I wish I was in Dixie
Hooray, hooray

289
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,826
In Dixie land
I'll take my stand

290
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:48,832
And live or die in Dixie

291
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,431
Major Briggs?

292
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,643
I need to see the sheriff.

293
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,813
Major Briggs.

294
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,028
More?

295
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,739
- I'm fine.
- Fine, Lucy.

296
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,449
Fine.

297
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:27,204
Major, what happened?

298
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,832
Well, as men who have dedicated
their lives to service,

299
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,917
I know
that you're able to understand

300
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,087
how sacred I hold
the Pledge of Allegiance.

301
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,048
And the cost one must pay
when breaking a pledge.

302
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,758
It can be very great.

303
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,136
Well, the Air Force, I thought,

304
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:47,391
was not unlike other societies of men
dedicated to the fight for the good.

305
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,769
Gentlemen, frankly, I'm worried.

306
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:54,148
When my superiors questioned me
about my disappearance,

307
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,401
they exhibited a degree of suspicion
and intolerance

308
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,070
bordering on the paranoid.

309
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:04,950
I must now admit that their motivation
in the search for the White Lodge

310
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,287
is not ideologically pure.

311
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:15,836
I believe that during my disappearance,
I was taken to the White Lodge.

312
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,923
I can remember virtually nothing.

313
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,093
But I have the clear intuitive sense

314
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:27,014
that there is much trouble ahead.

315
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,975
Major, what kind of trouble?

316
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,353
I am not aware of the form
it will take.

317
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,440
I will return.

318
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,359
Until that time,

319
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,780
I will be in the shadows
if you need me.

320
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:51,163
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Good day, major.

321
00:29:55,418 --> 00:30:00,672
- In the shadows. Can you beat that?
- Nope.

322
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,927
Excuse me, sheriff, Agent Cooper,
may I show you something?

323
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,523
Good.

324
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,150
I wanted all of you to hear this.

325
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,779
I've just spent almost the last 24 hours
with this charming young lady.

326
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:29,159
And as you can see, uh,
I have no bruises, no broken bones.

327
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:33,664
Any claims by her deceased
husband's brother that she is cursed

328
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,042
or somehow responsible for his death
is nonsense.

329
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:41,880
Now, what she does, in fact, possess
is a heightened sexual drive

330
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:46,426
and a working knowledge of technique,
anatomy and touch

331
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:50,556
that few men have ever had
the pleasure of experiencing

332
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,433
or the skill to match.

333
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,688
Is it hot in here?

334
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,773
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

335
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,112
Lana, let me be the first
to congratulate you.

336
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,239
Thank you.

337
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:11,493
Well, I could never have done it
without Dr. Jacoby.

338
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,998
Okay. Well, then,
we're gonna go bowling.

339
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,961
See you later, guys.

340
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,963
Hmm.

341
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,392
Don't anybody move.

342
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,186
Mr. Mayor.

343
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,813
Put the gun down.

344
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,525
Anybody that moves,
I'll blast her into kingdom come.

345
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,694
And the hippie too.

346
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,989
Dwayne.

347
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,826
Dwayne,
this isn't gonna solve anything.

348
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,455
- She killed my brother.
- Mr. Mayor, she killed no one.

349
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:00,459
- Horse dung.
- Fellas, I've got an idea.

350
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:04,296
Why don't we let Lana and the mayor
talk things over together? Alone.

351
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,757
I don't wanna talk. I wanna shoot.

352
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,885
Now, Dwayne,
you can always shoot later. Talk first.

353
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,804
Come on, in here.

354
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,599
Lana, it's okay. Mr. Mayor, please.

355
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,854
Mr. Mayor, please.

356
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,290
- Now what?
- We wait.

357
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,584
- We wait.
- We wait.

358
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,433
It's hard waiting.

359
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,185
Mm-hm.

360
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,106
Okay.

361
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,441
Ready, men?

362
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,069
Let's go.

363
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,330
We've decided to adopt a child.

364
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,670
He's so much like Dougie.

365
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,506
I just feel like my husband's
been brought back to life.

366
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:35,178
Well, I've been lonely and selfish.

367
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,474
I hope you'll all forgive me
for my boorish behavior.

368
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,602
Come along, my dear.

369
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,819
I don't know about you guys,

370
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,030
but I could definitely use
something to drink.

371
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,865
- Me too.
- Oh, yeah.

372
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,670
Hot dogs.

373
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,007
- We forgot the hot dogs.
- Pete.

374
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:16,386
We forgot the wienies.
All beef, with the skin on them.

375
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,348
- Has Josie gone shopping yet?
- Yes, she's already gone.

376
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,726
Well, if you think you can
tear yourself away

377
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:27,439
from all this high-level executive
decision-making for a moment,

378
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,358
I have something
I'd like to show you.

379
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,989
Have you ever asked yourself

380
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:40,452
how I really survived after the fire?

381
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:44,623
How I was able to marshal
the resources necessary

382
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,793
to defeat Benjamin Horne
and win back the mill?

383
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,005
Now that you mention it, yeah.

384
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,382
Come here.

385
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,893
Pete Martell.

386
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,399
Andrew?

387
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,237
I saw the boat.

388
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,699
- You...
- Take all the time you need.

389
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,201
Good old Pete.

390
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,205
As you can surmise,
I had my brother Andrew's help.

391
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,417
Now, let me get this straight.

392
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,881
You didn't die in the boat accident.

393
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,424
We didn't tell you, Pete...

394
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,719
With apologies much delayed.
- because you didn't need to know.

395
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,639
Okay. Fine.

396
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,724
We discovered the attempt
on my life was coming,

397
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,519
so we arranged this little deception.

398
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,981
Who tried to push the button
on you, Andy?

399
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:55,443
Does the name Thomas Eckhardt
mean anything to you?

400
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,530
No.

401
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,991
Eckhardt and I
were business partners.

402
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,660
I knew lumber, he knew Hong Kong.

403
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,621
We made a lot of money,
had some fun.

404
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:10,292
Then I got the better of him
in a piece of business,

405
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,294
and he tried to stab me in the back.

406
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,629
Really?

407
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,507
He's a very dangerous
and powerful opponent.

408
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,218
Eckhardt planned Andrew's death
for six years.

409
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,763
Does Josie know you're alive, Andy?

410
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,809
Pete, dear,
Josie worked for Thomas Eckhardt.

411
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,314
Oh, my God.

412
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,317
Does she still?

413
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,405
We'll know when Eckhardt arrives.

414
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,115
He's coming here?

415
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:46,494
I've never known
Josie's seductive powers to fail.

416
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:50,957
He'll come for her,
like a rat for cheese.

417
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,967
Good evening. How may I help you?

418
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,594
I have two suites reserved.

419
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,680
- Name?
- Eckhardt.

420
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,266
Thomas Eckhardt.

421
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,353
Welcome to Twin Peaks.

422
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:55,188
Andy, in here. We're gonna talk.

423
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:03,196
Andy?

424
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:07,200
Cooper. I need to ask you a favor.

425
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,828
Harry, let's get one thing straight.

426
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:14,040
I work for you now.
You say drink coffee, I'll drink coffee.

427
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,336
This just came over the wire
from Seattle.

428
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,507
Josie told me
she got away from him.

429
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,927
Think Josie had something to do
with this?

430
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,346
I don't know. I don't know.

431
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,890
That's why I need you to find out.

432
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,350
Okay, Harry.

433
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,232
When Lucy told me
about your theory,

434
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,193
I called the orphanage
and cut through the red tape.

435
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,698
Nicky is no more a murderer
than Lucy or I.

436
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,533
I believe "pathological"
was the phrase...

437
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:52,329
Dick, I did not drop you on your head
when I brought you into this world.

438
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,040
Don't give me cause to regret that.

439
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:59,127
- Doc, it's just that...
- Shut up, the both of you, and listen.

440
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,797
Nicky entered this world
through the back door,

441
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,885
where hope and promise
never see the light.

442
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:11,890
His mother was a poor immigrant
chambermaid at the Great Northern.

443
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,893
Nicky was conceived
during an assault in a back alley

444
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,936
by a man
who fled across the border.

445
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,105
She never reported it to the police

446
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:23,234
but when she began to show,
she reported it to me.

447
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:29,532
But Nicky's mother had a dream
of a better life for herself and her child.

448
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,370
A dream that she brought with her
to this country.

449
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,207
She decided to carry that child.

450
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,920
But the poor wretch
never saw the boy.

451
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,923
She died just as Nicky
took his first breath.

452
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:49,969
We buried her in potter's field
and sent the infant to the orphanage.

453
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,683
For several years, Nicky was shuttled
from one state home to another.

454
00:39:55,851 --> 00:40:00,063
And then one day,
hope shined on little Nicky.

455
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,650
A young, childless couple
took him into their lives.

456
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,986
They were loving, caring parents.

457
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:12,700
But it all collapsed one terrible moment
on an icy highway.

458
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,077
There was a crash.

459
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,914
Six-year-old Nicky managed
to pull his parents from the blazing car,

460
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,083
but it was too late.

461
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,044
And Nicky was alone again,

462
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,797
as he is today.

463
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,677
I hope you two are happy.

464
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:58,621
- James, what are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

465
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,333
Are you leaving? Are you leaving?

466
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,794
I can't stay here.

467
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,215
- I don't understand.
- It's wrong!

468
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,428
- Because I'm married?
- Yes.

469
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,307
Yes.

470
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,560
I love you, James.

471
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,566
I've never said that
to anybody before in my life.

472
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,193
I love you.

473
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,005
There's been an accident.

474
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,966
Jeffrey is dead.

475
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,970
- His car?
- Yes.

476
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,600
You killed him.

477
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,854
No. No. No.

478
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,398
My God! You set me up!

479
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,485
It was Malcolm's idea.
He's not my brother.

480
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,446
Hurry, James.

481
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,783
Go find that young girl
who loves you.

482
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,377
Go.

483
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,512
James?

484
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,389
Donna?

485
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,266
Donna.

486
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,851
We gotta hurry.

487
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,863
Come on. Come on.

488
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:02,722
Where is Shelly? Bad girl.

489
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,318
No, no. Come in.

490
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,862
It's all right. I'm a friend.

491
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,328
Come in.

492
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,418
You look like
you've had a very hard night.

493
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,505
Come. Sit.

494
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,675
I will help you.

495
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,178
What's your name?

496
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,890
- Leo.
- Leo?

497
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,483
Well, Leo.

498
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,195
You can call me Windom.

499
00:45:00,906 --> 00:46:10,892
Windom Earle.
