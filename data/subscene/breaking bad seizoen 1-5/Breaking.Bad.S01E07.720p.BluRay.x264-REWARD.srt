1
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,004
In closing, I can tell you

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:09,509
we take this very seriously.
APD as well as the DEA.

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,928
Stopping the manufacture
and sale of methamphetamines

4
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:14,097
remains one of
our highest priorities.

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:18,267
And the theft of lab equipment from your school
is also receiving our highest attention.

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,354
Rest assured,
no stone will go unturned

7
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,607
in our search for the person
or persons responsible for this.

8
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,652
If you have any questions,
now would be the time. Sir.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,947
You're talking like you
haven't caught anybody yet.

10
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,449
What about the janitor that was
dealing drugs at the school?

11
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:37,286
There is no indication that this
individual was selling drugs.

12
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,206
He was arrested for having
a small amount of marijuana

13
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,792
in his car,
not in the school.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,711
And he's since
been fired.

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,504
I heard he had a record.

16
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,881
I'd like to know how he got
a job here in the first place.

17
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,717
Exactly. Why wasn't there
a background check?

18
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:55,304
There was one. We're currently
reviewing our hiring policies.

19
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,973
You better be
doing more than that.

20
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,975
This guy was arrested
right in front of my daughter.

21
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,227
This guy was stealing
lab equipment, right?

22
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,479
That's not our thinking this time.

23
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,899
We're looking at others who also had access,
but not limited to the maintenance staff.

24
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,735
Are you saying
there was a break-in?

25
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,319
Do we know exactly
when this happened?

26
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,989
I mean, could it have been
during school hours?

27
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:16,492
We haven't been able to establish a date or time.
But there is no sign

28
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,994
of breaking or entering.

29
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,496
So whoever took it had a key.

30
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:24,000
We're talking inside job?
Someone who's still at the school?

31
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:26,836
Sir, at this time I'm not able
to discuss the details with you.

32
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:31,007
But what I can tell you is that we have some
very good people working very hard on this case.

33
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,177
I'm sorry, officer, but
that just sounds like double talk.

34
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,929
We're trying to protect our children.
You have to level with us.

35
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,224
Really, we're giving you
all the information we have.

36
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:43,269
You know what I'd like to see
in this school? Drug-sniffing dogs.

37
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:47,356
Yeah. Dogs and metal detectors
and locker searches and strip-searches.

38
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,525
Our district has strict policies...

39
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,360
I heard about
this school up in Canada,

40
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,197
they arrested one of the
groundskeepers with drugs,

41
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,034
and the next day they found out over
half of the students were high on LSD.

42
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,912
LSD? When were you
gonna tell us about the LSD?

43
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,416
No, please. No one
said anything about LSD.

44
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,088
What about the
equipment that was stolen?

45
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,759
The equipment was taken from
our chemistry-department locker.

46
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:19,472
And tonight we're lucky enough to have
someone here to give us some specifics.

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,224
Walt?

48
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,060
Yeah.

49
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:28,356
Mr. White is currently
on medical leave.

50
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,733
But as he's chair
of the science department,

51
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,070
he's made a very special
effort to be with us here.

52
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:38,074
And I'd like to take a moment
to thank him for that.

53
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:50,127
Could you please tell us more about
the equipment that was taken?

54
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,921
- Please.
- Yes.

55
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,465
Sorry.

56
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,927
And thank you.

57
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,976
The inventory list for the
missing lab-wear is as follows:

58
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:10,356
One 5000 milliliter
round-bottom boiling flask.

59
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:15,152
One Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 milliliters.

60
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,197
Two full-face respirators.

61
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:22,201
Some CEP funnels, some head
with a thermometer holder.

62
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,627
Ooh. Ow. Okay.
Okay. Okay.

63
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,213
Oh, wow.

64
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:41,304
Where did that come from?
And why was it so damn good?

65
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,057
Because it was illegal.

66
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,182
The basement.
Unfinished, of course.

67
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,184
But just look
at all this space.

68
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,270
You gotta think rec room,
media room.

69
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,523
Just imagine all the things
you could do down here.

70
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:38,402
Now remember, you're buying for
this fantastic neighborhood.

71
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,613
Big lawns
and shade trees,

72
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,032
walking distance to
the country club.

73
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,999
What happened there?

74
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:57,296
Bit of a fixer, but this
house has great bones.

75
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,885
Know what? We're zeroing in.

76
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,388
I've got another listing, brand-new,
right around the corner.

77
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,847
Yeah?
Yeah.

78
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,475
Hi.
Hi.

79
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,686
It's by appointment only.

80
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,188
Oh, well, I'm here
to see the owner.

81
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:20,569
Oh. He's in the, uh,
recreational vehicle.

82
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,036
Yo, it's appointment only.

83
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,925
How are you feeling?

84
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,513
About as good
as you look.

85
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:52,226
Jeez, you look like Lex Luthor.

86
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,396
Listen, I visited you in the
hospital, but you were asleep.

87
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,816
Yeah, Skinny Pete said
you wanted Tuco's address.

88
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,652
Acting like you're
all out for blood.

89
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,406
But you are alive.
Obviously you wised up.

90
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,450
No, I did go see him.

91
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,868
Bullshit.

92
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,786
So, what, are you
selling your house?

93
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,790
I got two dudes that turned into raspberry
slushy and flushed down my toilet.

94
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,334
I can't even take
a proper dump in there.

95
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,963
I mean, the whole damn house
has gotta be haunted by now.

96
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,467
You didn't actually go see Tuco.

97
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,053
Here.

98
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:34,226
That is 17,500.
Your half of the 35,000.

99
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,814
Plus, there's an extra 15 in there.
It's all yours. You've earned it.

100
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,025
You got this money from Tuco?

101
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,152
Yeah.
So Tuco gave you this,

102
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,653
is what you're saying.

103
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,863
Well, we made a deal.

104
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,491
You made a deal?
That's right.

105
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,828
How...? Why would you make
a deal with that scumbag?

106
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,330
You see what he did
to me?

107
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:59,168
Because I think that we can do business together.
We came to an understanding.

108
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,587
No way, man.
Okay? No understanding.

109
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,839
Take a look
at the money in your hand.

110
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,551
Now, just imagine
making that every week.

111
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:12,389
That's right. Two pounds a week,
35,000 a pound.

112
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:18,729
Without even talking to me
you told this insane ass-clown

113
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,274
dead-eyed killer that, uh...

114
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,360
That we would
give him 2 pounds a week.

115
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,196
We'll just scale up our operation,
we'll add a few more hours.

116
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,031
No, don't talk to me about hours.

117
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,451
What about pseudo, man?
How are we gonna get that?

118
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,413
You think the meth fairy's
just gonna bring it to us?

119
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,041
God, it takes me a week
to get this stuff.

120
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,252
I'm driving all the way
out to Las Cruces,

121
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,463
200 miles each way
to meet up with my smurfs.

122
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,633
Smurfs?
The dudes who go to the drugstores

123
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,719
and get a couple boxes at a time
and then sell them to me.

124
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,848
And that's maybe only good for,
like, maybe a half-pound worth.

125
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:58,060
See, that's the bottleneck
in your brilliant business plan.

126
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,270
All right.

127
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,898
Of course, you would've known
that if you would've just asked me.

128
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,235
Well, here we are again.

129
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,445
Here we are.

130
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,281
Skyler, you look great.
Thank you.

131
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,867
You must be, what,
six, seven months?

132
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,744
How goes it?
It's great.

133
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,789
Um, other than waddling to
the bathroom every five minutes.

134
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,501
The baby shower
is next week.

135
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,753
And it'll be good to...

136
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,507
It'll be good to have a day
that's just about Skyler.

137
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,634
Very nice.

138
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,095
Thank you.
Thank you.

139
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,097
Well, Walt, I see you've
committed to the hair loss.

140
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,099
Mm. Yeah.

141
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,602
How do you feel?
Ah, okay.

142
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,147
L... You know,
pretty decent, actually.

143
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,609
His color is better.
You know, his energy.

144
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:51,322
And he's even more, um, physical.

145
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,032
More physical?

146
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,784
Ah, well, sexual.

147
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,703
Um...

148
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:02,541
Frisky, actually. I mean, that's
gotta be a good sign, right?

149
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,793
Sure, I'll take that. Right, Walt?

150
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,003
Right.

151
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,547
Couldn't that mean that
the chemo is working?

152
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,801
Well, realistically, it may just mean that
we've got the antiemetics tuned right.

153
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:17,139
Truth is, until Walt's finished this round
of chemo and we look at a new PET scan,

154
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,350
we just can't say
for sure.

155
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,435
Well, isn't there
anything else we could be doing?

156
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,397
I've been wondering
about alternative medicine.

157
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,984
I mean, Eastern healing.

158
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,070
You know, holistic.

159
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,364
Well, I can't speak to its efficacy,

160
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,450
but as long as it doesn't
interfere with our treatment,

161
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,536
anything that helps my patient
have a better outlook,

162
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,499
a better comfort, is fine by me.

163
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:47,920
So you're saying
it's just all psychological.

164
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,339
It doesn't make any
real difference.

165
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:54,176
Having a better outlook can
make a tremendous difference.

166
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:58,472
But it's also important that
we manage our expectations.

167
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,369
What?

168
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:29,503
A junkyard? Let me guess,
you picked this place?

169
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,424
What's wrong with it?
It's private.

170
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:38,012
This is like a non-criminal's
idea of a drug meet.

171
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,889
This is like, "Oh, I saw this
in a movie. Ooh, look at me."

172
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,893
Yes. So where do you transact your business?
Enlighten me.

173
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,813
I don't know,
how about Taco Cabeza?

174
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,941
Half the deals I've ever done
went down at Taco Cabeza.

175
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:55,571
Nice and public.
Open 24 hours.

176
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,158
Nobody ever gets shot
at Taco Cabeza.

177
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,411
Hell, why not
the mall?

178
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,956
You know, wait at the Gap.
"Hey, it's time for the meet."

179
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,917
You know, I'll put down
the flat-front khakis,

180
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,420
head on over,
grab an Orange Julius.

181
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:15,174
Skip the part where
psycho-lunatic Tuco, you know,

182
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,260
comes and steals my drugs and
leaves me bleeding to death.

183
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,106
Look, you don't have
to be here for this.

184
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,150
Okay? I mean,
seriously.

185
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,110
I'm okay.

186
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,324
No. I'm no pussy.

187
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,868
I'm good.

188
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,804
Mr. Clean and his boy.

189
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,974
Now, I'm sorry
that I had to tune you up.

190
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,353
Respect, ése,
you gotta give it to get it.

191
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,231
Ahh.

192
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,526
Hey, what are we doing
way the hell out here?

193
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,487
What, they close the mall
or something?

194
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,533
Heisenberg, come on,
break it out.

195
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,330
That's it? That's all you got?

196
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,666
We had some
production problems.

197
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,001
0.53.

198
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,421
I thought you was
a player.

199
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,549
You told me
2 pounds,

200
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,177
and now you waste my time
with these Chiclets?

201
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:57,526
Seventeen and a half. Minus
the half for wasting my time.

202
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,195
Hey, come on.
What, you gonna argue?

203
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,781
You got something to say?

204
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,662
You're doing business
like a couple little bitches.

205
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,039
I want all of it.

206
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,210
Seventy grand.

207
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,879
What did you say?

208
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,547
You like this product.

209
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,591
And you want more.

210
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,719
Consider it a capital investment.

211
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,974
Look, old, bald motherfucker.

212
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,397
Fifty-two and a half,
25 points vig.

213
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,941
Vig?

214
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,236
Interest, weekly.

215
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,907
Okay.

216
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:51,914
That's $65,625
with interest.

217
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:56,251
- 1.875 pounds.
- No, 2 pounds.

218
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,838
Next Friday,
and no production problems.

219
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,509
Can you handle 4 pounds?

220
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,099
Listen, old man, talk is talk.

221
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:16,271
But owing me money,
that's bad.

222
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:41,630
What did you just do?

223
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:50,305
Four pounds. Four pounds.
Two pounds wasn't bad enough.

224
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:54,560
We're talking 2, 300 boxes
of sinus pills.

225
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,728
There ain't that many
smurfs in the world.

226
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,897
We're not going to need
pseudoephedrine.

227
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,942
We're gonna make phenylacetone
in a tube furnace.

228
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,405
Then we're gonna use reductive amination
to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds.

229
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,324
So no pseudo?
No pseudo.

230
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,285
So you do have a plan.

231
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,745
Yeah, Mr. White.

232
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,330
Yeah, science.

233
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,249
Okay.

234
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,548
What's this?
That is a shopping list.

235
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,218
Ah, getting some of those
items may be challenging.

236
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,721
One autotransformer,

237
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:36,476
Six liters anhydrous
methenamine.

238
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,521
Two 35 M and M tube furnaces.

239
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,897
It's mm, millimeter.

240
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,234
One 70 millimeter would be fine,
but they're hard to come by, so...

241
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,695
Forty grams thorium nitrate.

242
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,615
Yo, Mr. White, I can't even
pronounce half this shit.

243
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,491
No. You know what?
Count me out. All right?

244
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,161
I'm leaving town. I'm moving
to, like, Oregon or something.

245
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,997
This is just...
Jesse, Jesse, Jesse. Listen to me.

246
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,209
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

247
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:03,754
What are you doing?

248
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,299
This is the first day of the rest of your life.
But what kind of life will it be, huh?

249
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:11,386
Will it be a life of fear, of "Oh, no, no, no.
I can't do this."

250
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,431
Of never once
believing in yourself?

251
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,725
Hm?
I don't know.

252
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,729
Listen. These things?
We need them, all right?

253
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,149
And only you can
get them for us.

254
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:34,117
Okay, it's ready. Here you go.

255
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:38,997
Hi, baby.
I'm your Aunt Marie.

256
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,167
Now, of course you already know
that because when you watch this,

257
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:45,587
20 years from now, I will look
exactly the same as I do now.

258
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:51,343
I know, it is amazing. I have
aged shockingly well. Haven't I?

259
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:56,932
Anyway, welcome to your
baby shower, Esmeralda.

260
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,600
Esmeralda?

261
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,312
Esmeralda. That's your name
and you heard it here first.

262
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,942
Now, that is your wonderful,
handsome older brother.

263
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,945
Show her, older brother,
your face.

264
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:15,325
Okay, not right up the nose. Don't...
Okay, not up it. Back. Back to me.

265
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:20,330
Here's your mommy.
Hello, Mom.

266
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,791
And look, there you are,
Esmeralda.

267
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,959
Yeah.

268
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,712
Wake up, baby.
Time to party.

269
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,549
Okay. Easy, easy.
Believe it or not,

270
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:35,846
Esmeralda, right after the party,
your name was changed to Holly.

271
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,306
And I believe, Hank, that
that was around the time.

272
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,517
That we took Aunt Marie
to the insane asylum.

273
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,978
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I dropped her off at the curb.

274
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:46,148
Then I married Shania Twain
and lived happily ever after.

275
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,191
Ha, ha, ha.

276
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:55,323
There's Daddy. Speak, Daddy.
Say hello to your daughter.

277
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,576
Oh, uh...

278
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,582
Holly, I am very proud of you.

279
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,502
And I... I think about you
all the time.

280
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,046
Aww.

281
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:17,345
Wherever you go,
whatever you do in life,

282
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:23,351
always know that you have a family
who loves you very, very much.

283
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,690
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

284
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:33,528
Oh, my God, it's so cute.
Oh, Carmen. It's...

285
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:37,032
Oh, look. Look at that.
It's adorable.

286
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,577
I love it, Carmen. Thank you.
You're so welcome, honey.

287
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:44,039
Thank you. Look
at the little feet.

288
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,462
Okay. Oh.
From me. And Hank.

289
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,048
Oh. What nice
wrapping paper.

290
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,383
Marie always finds
the best wrapping paper.

291
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,386
I do.
Okay.

292
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,556
Let's see. And...

293
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,058
Exciting.

294
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:07,729
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

295
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,110
It's... It's a...

296
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,738
A tiara.
Yes.

297
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,908
Oh, wow! Oh.

298
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,327
Marie, is this...?

299
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:26,331
White gold and several
carats worth of zircons.

300
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,000
Oh, Marie.
You spent too much on this.

301
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,420
You shouldn't have.
You really, really shouldn't.

302
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,591
But it's so...
It's really... It's...

303
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,843
It's sparkly.

304
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,179
Sparkly.
I know.

305
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,430
Thank you.

306
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,266
Hey, listen, Walt.

307
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,268
You got anything
stronger than beer?

308
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,271
It's... It's great. I love it.
Yeah.

309
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,775
Thank you. Thank you,
sweetie, thank you.

310
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:57,779
Sorry, man. It's just, you know, after
200 presents, it just gets kind of old.

311
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,828
It's nice stuff.
It is, isn't it?

312
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:11,376
I got just the thing
to go with that.

313
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,885
I'm sorry, man, I wasn't thinking.
No, no, no. It's okay.

314
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,970
You mind if I have one?

315
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:23,972
You think that's a good idea?

316
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,642
Hank, I've already got lung cancer.

317
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,980
Okay.
You got me there.

318
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,191
Thanks.

319
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,863
Cuban.

320
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,239
Mm.

321
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,995
I did a little favor for an FBI guy.

322
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,834
Now, I was under
the impression, ahem,

323
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,503
that these were illegal.

324
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:02,636
Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit
tastes the sweetest, doesn't it?

325
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:10,727
It's funny, isn't it?
How we draw that line.

326
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,520
Yeah.

327
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,898
What line is that?

328
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:22,697
Well, what's legal, what's illegal.
You know, Cuban cigars, alcohol.

329
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:28,578
You know, if we were drinking this
in 1930, we'd be breaking the law.

330
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:32,040
Another year, we'd be okay.

331
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,044
Mm. Who knows what
will be legal next year.

332
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,255
You mean like pot?

333
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:48,223
Yeah. Like pot.
Or whatever.

334
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,310
Cocaine? Heroin?

335
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,064
I'm just saying it's arbitrary.

336
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,234
Well, you ought to visit lockup.

337
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,820
You hear a lot of guys
talking like that.

338
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:05,657
"Hey, man, what, you busting me
with these 14 bales of ganja?

339
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:10,453
It's all gonna be legal next year
when Willie Nelson's president."

340
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,080
Say it, buddy.

341
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,290
It don't only go one way either.

342
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,836
I mean, some other stuff
is legal that shouldn't be.

343
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:22,298
I mean, frigging meth
used to be legal.

344
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,844
Used to sell it over every counter
at every pharmacy across America.

345
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,432
Thank God they came to
their senses on that one, huh?

346
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,644
Yeah.

347
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,277
Okay.

348
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,784
Nice party.
Mmm.

349
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,206
A tiara.

350
00:22:55,374 --> 00:23:00,045
A white-gold tiara
for a newborn baby.

351
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:05,467
Yeah. You know, I think she got that
at Gertrude Zachary's in Knob Hill.

352
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:11,973
I mean, that thing must've cost,
like, what, 5 or 600 dollars.

353
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,020
You know, I think
I'm gonna return it.

354
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,814
Are you sure?
She's bound to find out.

355
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:24,069
Well, maybe I can explain to her
that we need a Diaper Genie

356
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:29,157
more than a white-gold
baby tiara.

357
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,244
Hey. You know,
I've been thinking

358
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,748
about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli
about alternative medicine.

359
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,417
No. Don't worry. I'm not
gonna mention that anymore.

360
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:44,005
No, no, no. What I mean is that
maybe there is something to it.

361
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:51,846
Look. They do this Navajo
sweat lodge up by Farmington.

362
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,892
Healing ceremony. It's supposed
to be good for your lungs.

363
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,436
I'm not saying that
I believe in it, but, uh...

364
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:03,441
Well, it might be an experience.

365
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,027
Really?

366
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,403
You?

367
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,405
In a sweat lodge.

368
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,701
Ah, I was thinking about driving up
on Friday, coming back Sunday.

369
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,872
I mean, if you're okay with it.
Well, of course I'm okay with that.

370
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,624
Okay.

371
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,635
Sweat lodge?
Yeah.

372
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,346
I'm already sweating.
Help me out.

373
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,266
Okay. Ow.

374
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,351
Hey.

375
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,565
Seventy millimeter tube furnace.
Excellent. This is excellent.

376
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,899
Very good work.
Damn straight.

377
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:48,069
Okay, hydrogen.
Electrolytically produced, yes?

378
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,113
Yeah, like you asked.
I mean, this...

379
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:53,825
This crap wasn't easy to get.
And it's expensive.

380
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,785
Methylamine.
Where's the methylamine?

381
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,662
I don't see the methylamine.

382
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:01,791
Yeah, well, that's where
I ran into some trouble.

383
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,418
What kind of trouble?

384
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,753
Well, half this crap
I could just buy, right?

385
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,090
But this methylamine...

386
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,677
Not so easy. I mean,
they got it locked down tight.

387
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:16,097
But I did find some pros
who will rip it off for us.

388
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,100
But they want 10 grand.

389
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,102
So, what's the problem?
You have the money.

390
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,855
No, had. I spent
almost the whole wad.

391
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,440
I mean, I got
like 2 grand left.

392
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,276
I told you, all this
crap was expensive.

393
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:32,447
So these thieves, did they say where
they would be stealing it from?

394
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,366
A chemical supply place,
south of town.

395
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:39,621
They got guards and security
cameras. They got steel doors.

396
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,041
That's why these dudes
are charging so much.

397
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,292
What?

398
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,885
Hmm.

399
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,644
So why don't we
just steal it ourselves?

400
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,563
Yeah?

401
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,941
How we gonna
do that?

402
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,985
With this.

403
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,252
So, what's this stuff called again?

404
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,173
Thermite.

405
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,592
And that will cut
through a lock?

406
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,428
Because this is supposed
to be one big-ass lock.

407
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,181
In World War II,

408
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:44,352
the Germans had an artillery piece...
It's the biggest in the world.

409
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,437
- Called the Gustav Gun.

410
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,232
And it weighed
a thousand tons.

411
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,736
And the Gustav was capable
of firing a 7-ton shell

412
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:58,366
and hitting a target,
accurately, 23 miles away.

413
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,705
I mean, you could drop bombs
on it every day for a month

414
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,374
without ever disabling it.

415
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:10,378
But drop a commando,

416
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:14,757
one man,
with just a bag of this...

417
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,929
and he could melt right through
4 inches of solid steel

418
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,390
and destroy that gun forever.

419
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,353
Jeez.

420
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,150
So, yes,

421
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:37,405
I think it will cut through
any lock we're likely to find.

422
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:42,285
- You'd like to return this.
- It's very nice, but yes.

423
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,704
Well, it... It is from
this store, isn't it?

424
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,582
Oh, yes, it's from this store.

425
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,917
Do you happen to have a receipt?

426
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,587
No, I don't. It was a gift.

427
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,464
Aha. A gift.
Mm-hm.

428
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,924
Mr. Wilson, could you
step over here, please?

429
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,972
Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch
this lady while I phone the police.

430
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,058
Whoa, excuse me?

431
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,770
Ma'am, this item is stolen,
as I'm sure you know.

432
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,314
It...
Come with me, please.

433
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:17,695
Oh, yes. I intend
to press charges.

434
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,573
Please do.

435
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,076
We'll be here.

436
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:28,623
Look, I... I've never stolen
anything in my life.

437
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:32,835
All right? I told you,
that tiara was a gift...

438
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,212
A baby-shower gift.

439
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,255
So who gave it to you, then?

440
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,009
I don't think I have
to tell you that.

441
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,969
Ma'am, you don't have
to tell me anything.

442
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,971
You can talk to the police.

443
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,474
And I can tell them how my
daughter-in-law remembers

444
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,644
showing this particular item
to a tall blond woman

445
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:53,147
who, when her back was turned,
walked right out the door with it.

446
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,024
So there.
Oh, yeah?

447
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:59,195
Well, then, I can talk
to the Channel Three News.

448
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:03,324
Yeah, I can tell them how
you people, without a shred...

449
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,536
Without a modicum of evidence,
illegally detained

450
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:11,165
an innocent pregnant woman
in a dank storeroom.

451
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:15,169
This is my office.
I feel I'm being held hostage.

452
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:19,006
Furthermore, I'm not
getting enough air back here.

453
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,801
I don't think... I don't
think I can breathe.

454
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,846
Oh, my... Oh, my God. Oh, no.

455
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:28,141
I'm going into labor.
Yes, I... Oh!

456
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,237
Hi, you've reached Marie.
Do the beep thing.

457
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:44,866
Marie, it's Skyler.
I just left Zachary's.

458
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,702
I need to talk to you
immediately.

459
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,416
Where is the guard? He's
supposed to be coming by.

460
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:54,876
Do you think he already passed?

461
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,752
Look, I don't... I don't know.

462
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,713
Okay. Wait, there he is.
There he is.

463
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,548
Yeah, yeah, I see him.

464
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,383
Okay, wait till he passes.

465
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,093
Okay, it's clear.

466
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,390
Here.

467
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,687
What the hell is this?
It's all they had.

468
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:17,857
Then you go to another store. If this is
all they had, you're in the wrong place.

469
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,358
Just put it on.

470
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,444
Should've... Of course.

471
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,119
Okay, okay.

472
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,623
Okay. This is it.

473
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,084
Oh, God.

474
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,932
Okay.

475
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,101
- Get...
- What?

476
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,229
- Look.
- What?

477
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,064
Hey, Jimmy, I'm stopping...

478
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:01,484
He's not supposed to come back.
What's he doing?

479
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,236
Oh, my God.

480
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,947
Hope everything comes out all right.

481
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,408
He's going to the crapper.
Oh, God.

482
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,620
Okay. You coming, man? Come on.
What are you doing?

483
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:46,988
Okay, there it is.

484
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,284
Is this gonna be loud?

485
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,036
You'll find out
in about 10 seconds.

486
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,289
Stand back.

487
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,501
Jesus.

488
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,973
Come on, come on.

489
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,978
Hey, what's going on?

490
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:25,359
Where are the gallon jugs?
I don't...

491
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,029
God!
What?

492
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,531
Let's just take this.
Come on, come on.

493
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,491
What the...?

494
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,869
Damn it.

495
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,376
What the hell are you
doing opening the door?

496
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,045
How are we gonna
take this thing out?

497
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,671
Come on. Take that.

498
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,048
Lift.

499
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,593
- God.
- Jeez.

500
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,430
Hey. Somebody?

501
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,265
Billy, you
back from the crapper yet?

502
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,600
Let me out of here.

503
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:01,771
I'm gonna kick somebody's ass.
The alarm's going off. Check it out.

504
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,774
Billy? Billy?

505
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,777
Jimmy? Help!

506
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,752
Come on, man, let me try it.
How is it gonna be any different?

507
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,629
Can I just try it?
Fine, fine, go ahead.

508
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,215
Jesus. Okay.

509
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,425
All right.

510
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,268
Yeah, baby. See?
Eat it. Okay, I'm the king.

511
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,978
Yeah, okay.
I'm the king.

512
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,943
Oh, no. No, no, no.
That didn't sound good.

513
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,447
Oh, God.

514
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,450
Well, this thing's
not going anywhere.

515
00:33:56,618 --> 00:34:00,329
We're not cooking in my damn
driveway, I'll tell you that.

516
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,294
God.

517
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,005
What part of "slow it down"
did you not understand?

518
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:14,301
What are you talking...? I'm... It's heavy, man.
It got away from me.

519
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,596
Okay. All right. Now,
that's good, that's good.

520
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,849
Now just bring it up,
bring it up.

521
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:23,144
Easy, easy, easy. Okay.

522
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,814
Your real-estate agent, when
is she supposed to come back?

523
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,441
Oh, shit.

524
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,985
Yeah. I don't know.

525
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,778
I'll make damn sure
she doesn't.

526
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,825
Good call, yo.

527
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,695
Keep the temperature
steady at 425 degrees.

528
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:18,407
We'll need to run it
two more hours

529
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:21,076
to have enough to make
4.5 pounds.

530
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,370
Four and a half, not 4?

531
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,582
Two pounds pays, two go back.

532
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:31,295
Four and a half pounds
puts us $44,000 ahead.

533
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,423
Each.
Right on, man.

534
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,883
Right on.

535
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,761
With the amount of methylamine
that we got last night,

536
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,972
we can make
4.5 pounds a week for...

537
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,642
Well, for the foreseeable future.

538
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,437
How long is, uh, that gonna be?

539
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,775
I mean, in your, uh, situation.

540
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,402
How much cash
do you need?

541
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,572
More.

542
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,497
Someone's in the yard.
Shh.

543
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:10,334
Yeah, this is definitely the one.

544
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,836
It's pretty.

545
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,130
Actually, I like it.

546
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,341
We could pull that out
and put in a closet.

547
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,302
Just a little...
We'll have to bring that down.

548
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,264
I thought you didn't
like that type of thing.

549
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,141
Oh, no. No, I don't.

550
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:27,935
Right, right.

551
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,478
Shh. Shh.

552
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:37,653
Was there, by any chance, scheduled
for this afternoon, an open house?

553
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,614
I left her a message, man.
It's not my fault.

554
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,826
I don't care how you do it, just keep
them out of here. Do you understand?

555
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,786
Yeah.
All right, go.

556
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,476
Absolutely.

557
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,151
You know, you can't
duck me forever.

558
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,611
What?

559
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,030
Come on, I left you
like 15 messages.

560
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,699
When I went to your office,
you snuck out the back way.

561
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,785
I didn't sneak.
I was going to lunch.

562
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,996
Jeez, Skyler, what are you,
the paranoid police?

563
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:33,500
You know what, Marie? Marie, I have
never been so humiliated in my life.

564
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,920
That... Ahem.

565
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,131
That tiara.

566
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:43,344
They accused me,
at Zachary's, of shoplifting it.

567
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,012
What were you doing at Zachary's?

568
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,599
I was returning it.

569
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:51,685
You were returning it.

570
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,854
Why would you return it?

571
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,440
It just wasn't...

572
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,694
Marie, what is wrong with you?
Can you please tell me that?

573
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:04,031
Can you tell me why
you'd do such a thing?

574
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:10,454
What does that mean?
Does that mean you don't know?

575
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:17,795
That... means that I have no idea what
the hell you're even talking about.

576
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:21,006
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

577
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,758
The shop...

578
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:26,804
The shoplifting. No idea?

579
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,809
You're not
going to admit this, are you?

580
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:36,313
I can't really admit
to something

581
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:40,359
when I have no knowledge
of what it is that I'm admitting.

582
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,293
Would you like
that gift-wrapped?

583
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,461
Yes, actually.

584
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,922
Don't forget
to sign in.

585
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,263
Thank you.
Thank you.

586
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,142
You're right.

587
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:16,437
Look at this wall here.

588
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,447
Yo!

589
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:30,325
Excuse me, I'd just
like to see the basement.

590
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,703
Yeah, well, it's occupied.
It's not a bathroom.

591
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,997
Hey!
I just want to see the basement.

592
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,124
What's the big deal?

593
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,084
You ain't seeing
the basement, bitch.

594
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:42,254
You got that? Is that
sinking in? Now, beat it.

595
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,590
All you all,
house is not for sale.

596
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:46,842
Get the hell out!

597
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,131
Ahh.

598
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,509
Hey.
Hey.

599
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,138
So how was it?

600
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,476
Was it an experience?

601
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,144
Yeah.

602
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:42,064
It was definitely
an experience.

603
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,863
What's that smell?

604
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,909
Oh, yeah, it's...

605
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,787
sacred Navajo herbs.

606
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,705
You know.

607
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,471
Hey, everything okay?

608
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,181
No.

609
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,142
Not really.

610
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,812
Actually, not at all.

611
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,985
You know that tiara
that Marie gave us?

612
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:33,866
Yeah.
Well, she stole it. Yep.

613
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:38,078
I practically got arrested
trying to return it at the store.

614
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:39,580
Oh, my God.

615
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:43,792
I mean, she refuses to admit it.
She refuses to apologize.

616
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,086
I don't know what to do.

617
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,922
Hm.

618
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:56,430
People sometimes
do things for their families.

619
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,144
People sometimes
do things for their families?

620
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:05,314
And, what,
that justifies stealing?

621
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,400
Well...

622
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:12,237
Wow. That must've been
some sweat lodge.

623
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:16,533
Are you even listening to the
words coming out of your mouth?

624
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,789
What would you do
if it were me?

625
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,044
What do you mean,
if it were you?

626
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:31,423
If it were me, what would you do?
Would you divorce me?

627
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:35,427
Would you turn me in to the police?

628
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:47,022
You don't want to find out.

629
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,452
You want
something to eat?

630
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:06,166
Um, no, thanks.

631
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,352
What is this shit?
This is blue.

632
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:30,816
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

633
00:43:30,984 --> 00:43:33,944
It may be blue,
but it's the bomb.

634
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:44,621
Ah! Tight, tight, tight, yeah.

635
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,707
Blue, yellow, pink.

636
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,709
Whatever, man. Just keep
bringing me that.

637
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,629
Ahh.

638
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,054
4.6.

639
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:03,598
Come on.

640
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:07,936
And what'd I say, man?
This guy can cook.

641
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,063
You're all right, man.
You're all right.

642
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,899
We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

643
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,820
Just remember
who you're working for.

644
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,158
What did you say?

645
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,369
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

646
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,080
Like they don't
already know that?

647
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,959
Are you saying
that they're stupid?

648
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,421
No, I'm just...
I'm just saying.

649
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,215
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid.

650
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,010
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

651
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:43,138
No, come on, Tuco. I'm just...
I'm just saying.

652
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,140
No, you're just
speaking for me!

653
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:49,561
Like I ain't got the goddamn
sense to speak for myself!

654
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,190
Is that it? Is that
what you're doing?

655
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:56,777
Tuco.

656
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:02,115
Hey, why don't we
all just relax, huh?

657
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,376
Heisenberg says "relax."

658
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:21,051
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.

659
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,469
I'm relax...

660
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:41,321
Whoo! Damn, man!
Look at that! Look!

661
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,365
Whew!

662
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,618
That is messed up.

663
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,790
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.
