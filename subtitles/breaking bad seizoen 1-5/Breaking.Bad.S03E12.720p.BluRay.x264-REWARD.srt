1
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,661
Hey, guys.

2
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:54,257
So if it's okay, I was thinking
about using this one for the test.

3
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,509
Mom's brakes are very sticky...

4
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:01,764
...and you barely press down on them
and it's like a screech.

5
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,100
Sure.

6
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,854
But I'm good?

7
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,274
Yeah, you're great. Why?

8
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,193
Are my feet okay?

9
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:24,579
I looked it up. New Mexico says
all I need is a note from a doctor.

10
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,290
I know it's not the right way and all...

11
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:31,711
...but once I get my provisional,
I can keep working at it.

12
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:36,757
Well, as long as it gets you safely
from point A to point B...

13
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,594
...then who am I to argue?

14
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,105
Hi.

15
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:56,110
You're a sweet girl. Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

16
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,323
I know.

17
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,923
- Here you go.
- Here you go.

18
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,759
- All right.
- Thank you.

19
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,636
- Got it?
- Yeah.

20
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,138
Okay. All right.

21
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,601
- So 9 a.m. Saturday?
- Yes, 9 a.m. Saturday.

22
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,978
So which means
pick me up about 8:30?

23
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,814
- I'll be here with bells on.
- What?

24
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,777
It's just a saying.
Don't worry, I won't be wearing bells.

25
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,862
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

26
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,948
- Hi. Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

27
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,492
- Could you keep an eye on your sister?
- Sure.

28
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,993
- Thanks.
- See you, Dad.

29
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,829
- Bye, son. Hey, good work today.
- Thank you.

30
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,798
Have you thought any more
about what we discussed?

31
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,344
"Thought any more"
meaning reconsidered? No.

32
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,972
So show me the flaw in it.

33
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:11,394
Flaws, Skyler.
Flaws. Plural, not singular.

34
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,981
Where do you want me to start?

35
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:20,152
Hey, I don't love this situation,
all right, that you put me in.

36
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,865
However, let's just stick
with what makes sense here.

37
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,034
You took the money
you won gambling...

38
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,704
...invested it in the car wash
you helped run.

39
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:34,333
You hired your wife as a bookkeeper,
because she's actually a bookkeeper.

40
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,670
That is a story an auditor can believe.
What am I missing?

41
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,673
You should just take this money
that I give you...

42
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,925
...and not look too closely at it.

43
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:47,555
So if, God forbid, I get caught...

44
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,266
...you maintain plausible deniability.

45
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:54,270
Okay, my estranged husband who,
when he was working...

46
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:58,065
...made $43,000 a year,
starts shoveling money at me.

47
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,735
And when the police come,
I'm supposed to say:

48
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,405
"I never thought about it, officers.
Made sense to me." Really?

49
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:08,075
That, in your mind,
is plausible deniability?

50
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,036
I tell you what, Walt...

51
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,414
...I'd rather have them think
I'm Bonnie what's-her-name...

52
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,082
...than some complete idiot.

53
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:21,672
So you're promoting caution here.

54
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:26,093
And you want a believable story.

55
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,472
That, it seems to me,
is the safest way...

56
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:35,436
...to make the best
out of a very bad situation, yes.

57
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:42,109
But I'm noting a little hole
in your plot though.

58
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,280
Why would your estranged husband
be doing all this for you?

59
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:53,621
Because he loves his family and
desperately wants a reconciliation...

60
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,625
...though it may be hopeless
and futile.

61
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:02,213
Then again, he'd try anything.

62
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:09,136
I'm just not buying it.
No, I think it would be better...

63
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,598
...if the husband
were no longer estranged.

64
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,644
Yeah. Maybe if he were back
sleeping in his own bed.

65
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,982
It's suddenly a fantasy story.

66
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,156
I am at least gonna be a part
of this household.

67
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,826
Dinner with the family
every night of the week.

68
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,661
Not every night, no.

69
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,039
Six nights a week. One night off.

70
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,625
Dinner two nights. Not weekends.

71
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,502
With 24 hours' notice.

72
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,629
Five nights a week, with no notice.

73
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,965
Three. Six hours' notice.

74
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,801
- Five nights a week, two hours' notice.
- Four.

75
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:52,012
Don't push it.

76
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,225
- And I want my own key to the house.
- No.

77
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,727
For emergencies and appearances,
yes.

78
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,857
I am going to babysit my own daughter,
help my son with his homework.

79
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:08,863
I am going to be a part of this family.
That is how we'll sell your little fiction.

80
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,307
How about we stop somewhere
afterward and get a beer?

81
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,610
No. Thanks, though.
Maybe some other time.

82
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,070
Seriously.

83
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,573
Get a beer with me.

84
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,346
What?

85
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,439
What the hell are you doing?

86
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,900
That's ours, right?

87
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,487
Look at it and tell me if that's ours.

88
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,412
Yes, it's ours. Now put it away.

89
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,958
What the hell is wrong with you?

90
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,294
Where did you get that?
Did you take it from the lab?

91
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,673
I bought it from the two guys
who killed Combo.

92
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,468
They had Combo shot down
in the street...

93
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:58,013
...and now it's our product
they're selling.

94
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,517
Which means they work for our guy.
Right?

95
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:05,312
What? No. What is that?
That's hearsay. Do you have any proof?

96
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,900
I heard it from the sister
of the kid who shot him.

97
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,612
Hear how I just said "kid"?

98
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,825
This kid, he's 11 years old.

99
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,995
Shot Combo on orders.

100
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,790
These two scumbags,
they got him dealing.

101
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,667
They got him...

102
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,794
And you know he's not the first.

103
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:34,633
They use kids because hey, why not?
Easy to control. Easy to fool.

104
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,136
All they get is juvie
if they get caught.

105
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,722
Hearts and minds, right?

106
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,851
Get them young
and they're yours forever.

107
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,562
These guys killed Combo.

108
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,191
They used this little kid
like some puppet.

109
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,697
They used him to shoot my friend.

110
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,205
So why are you telling me this?

111
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,210
I need your help.

112
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,255
How?

113
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,759
- I need ricin.
- Oh, my God.

114
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,179
- Oh, my God.
- Look, these two...

115
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,388
- Hey.
- No.

116
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:25,559
Hey, they gotta go. All right?
I got the entire thing figured out.

117
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,728
- No.
- The delivery method, everything.

118
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,231
All I need from you is the poison,
that's all.

119
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,734
- No...
- Look.

120
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,695
- Otherwise, you don't gotta lift a finger.
- No.

121
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,114
You don't know
what you're talking about.

122
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,368
- Not even...
- Look, you don't get how right this is?

123
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:46,747
You don't get how the whole
entire world would be better off?

124
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,540
We're not talking about this.

125
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,378
I know a woman who buys
from these two once or twice a week.

126
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:57,091
They sit in their car all day and they
get hungry, so she brings them food...

127
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,635
...and they knock a few bucks
off her price.

128
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,471
There's your delivery system
right there.

129
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,932
- I could be a mile away.
- Jesus.

130
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,768
A meth-head
you're trusting to do this?

131
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,271
Know what? That meth-head stood up
to your brother-in-law.

132
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,109
He questioned her for five hours.
She didn't give it up.

133
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,779
Know how you know?
Because you're not in prison right now.

134
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,448
Well, I know I would be in prison
after this.

135
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,785
Prison or worse.
And I'd be right alongside you.

136
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,788
No, Jesse, you cannot be serious.

137
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,125
This is a ridiculous idea.

138
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,962
It's ridiculous? What,
so you're saying it's not gonna work?

139
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,507
How about back when
it was your plan?

140
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,592
When we were gonna
use it on Tuco.

141
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,595
- Apples and oranges.
- Guy eats ricin...

142
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,350
...two or three days later he gets the flu
or a heart attack and he keels over.

143
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,979
That's what you said.
Untraceable back to us.

144
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,440
To me.

145
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:59,319
Not even that other scumbag
we work for is ever gonna figure it out.

146
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,824
It was a good plan back when
it was Tuco, and it's a good plan now.

147
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:09,371
Tuco wanted to murder us.
These guys don't.

148
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:14,376
Apples and oranges. Do I really have
to sit here and explain the difference?

149
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:18,672
Combo was us, man.

150
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,301
He was one of us.
Does that mean nothing?

151
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,680
Why didn't you go after these guys
two or three months ago?

152
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,974
Because I just found out about them.

153
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,642
What's to find out?

154
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,519
It's a dispute over turf, right?

155
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:37,733
I mean, how hard could it have been for
you to track them down on their turf...

156
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,694
...and kill them months ago?

157
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:46,867
Because back then, you were too busy
getting high, feeling sorry.

158
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,537
Now, murder...

159
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:54,082
...is not part of your
12-step program.

160
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,669
This is not some amends
that you have to make.

161
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,423
What you are talking about here
is pointless.

162
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,219
This achieves nothing.

163
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,680
It accomplishes nothing.

164
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,188
If you don't see
what it accomplishes...

165
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,399
...then there's no way
I can explain it to you.

166
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,528
Jesse, listen to me.

167
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:26,073
You are not a murderer.

168
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,660
I'm not, and you're not.

169
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,913
It's as simple as that.

170
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,086
Jesse.

171
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,589
I'm doing it.

172
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,260
With or without you.

173
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,624
Knock, knock.

174
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,628
Chrissakes, Marie, you don't say
"knock, knock," you... like that.

175
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,715
- I like saying it.
- Well, that's not the rules.

176
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,135
- Okay?
- You knock your way, I'll knock mine.

177
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,429
But look, see? I win.

178
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,514
Not so fast.

179
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,767
Christ, again? That's three in a row.

180
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,478
Got a fricking Paul Newman
over here?

181
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,982
- Been playing cards with your dad?
- No. Why?

182
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,193
How is your old man?

183
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,653
Back teaching?

184
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,115
No. I don't think
either of them are working...

185
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,534
...right now.
- How they swinging that?

186
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,620
- I don't know.
- Hey...

187
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,497
...did you know
the doctors told your Uncle Hank...

188
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,000
...he can get out of here
anytime he wants?

189
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,461
Oh, yeah? That's great.

190
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:06,173
- Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.
- Why not?

191
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,383
What? That's what they said.

192
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,177
Because they want the room.

193
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:13,055
They hit the sheets with Lysol,
reset the meter...

194
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:17,017
...and wheel the next slob in.
We went over this, Marie. Drop it.

195
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,480
Are you not well enough?

196
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,817
Jesus, kid, you too?
Do I look well enough?

197
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,695
I'm shitting in pans,
peeing in pitchers.

198
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,573
I can't move my legs. Got it?

199
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:35,160
So people in wheelchairs
should be in hospitals?

200
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:40,040
What about people on crutches?
Maybe I should be in here too.

201
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:45,545
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- Exactly. Deal, you little prick.

202
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,108
Bitch.

203
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,028
You know I'm hourly, right?

204
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,032
He promised me
that he would be here.

205
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,784
Oh, he promised.

206
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:20,539
Why didn't you tell me? Let's wait then.
That's a joke. The kid ain't coming.

207
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:25,585
- Okay, so, what's plan B?
- I don't know.

208
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,089
- I really don't.
- Well, let's brainstorm.

209
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,468
- You really think he's serious?
- That's why I'm here, Saul.

210
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:38,265
The way he was talking,
he is going to do it. Or try, at least.

211
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,600
Okay, so we pay him off.

212
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,563
No, no, it's not about money.
It's about getting him off the streets.

213
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,399
Getting him to calm down.

214
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,568
Maybe...

215
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,117
What if we, maybe?

216
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,954
Could you get him arrested?

217
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,835
You want your criminal associate
taken into police custody?

218
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,337
No, now listen.
I know it sounds risky.

219
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,091
But it wouldn't anything
that would get him into real trouble...

220
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,094
...and nothing that could lead back
to our business.

221
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,804
Just some minor offense.

222
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,849
Pinkman in jail? I don't know.
I'm picturing it and...

223
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:26,146
No, not jail as in "jail" jail.

224
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,149
I'm talking about
one of those situations...

225
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:33,528
...where you're in an orange jumpsuit
picking up litter along the highway.

226
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,989
That's jail.

227
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,493
You're talking about a level-two joint.

228
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,496
Something that keeps him off
the street for 30 days.

229
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,331
Then by the time he gets out...

230
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,334
...tempers have cooled
and hopefully we can move on.

231
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:51,463
Well, Roswell Correctional's
pretty low impact, you know.

232
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,633
In the past,
I've recommended Springer...

233
00:18:54,801 --> 00:19:00,013
...but I'm hearing chancy things about
their bathrooms since they renovated.

234
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,556
So...

235
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,975
So it's possible, right?

236
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,854
Well, it falls under
my Premium Services Package...

237
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:12,526
...but you can afford that.
I'll call my PI.

238
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,533
You understand what you have to do?

239
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,373
And you can never talk to anyone,
right?

240
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,586
I mean, ever. Understand?

241
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,463
Yeah.

242
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:40,053
I found this stuff on the Internet.

243
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,347
Takes days to kick in.

244
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,767
Just keep quiet
and this won't ever come back to you.

245
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,397
You okay with this, right?

246
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,402
Just think of it
like it's the same thing as always.

247
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,280
You're just delivering
some hamburgers.

248
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,077
It's not just delivering hamburgers.

249
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:09,082
Hey. You got a kid, right?

250
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,419
- What's his name?
- Patrick.

251
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:17,883
All right, imagine these two guys
had Patrick working as a mule.

252
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,926
Making him kill people.

253
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,054
Wouldn't you do anything
to protect your kid?

254
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,224
Of course I would.
I do all kinds of things for him.

255
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,730
Okay, so...

256
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,650
...these guys are using kids like that.

257
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,738
They gotta go. Right?

258
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,662
Good.

259
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,796
Tomorrow.

260
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,424
I'll be in touch.

261
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,822
Yeah. I bet that tastes good, huh?

262
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,621
Hey.

263
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,332
Come here, baby.

264
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,503
Okay. Here we go.

265
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,089
Here we go.

266
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,979
What are you doing?
If you need to talk, use the phone.

267
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,232
This isn't a phone talk, Walter.

268
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,859
Your wife's out, right?

269
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,198
Isn't she something?

270
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,034
I got a granddaughter
a few years older.

271
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,829
What can I do for you?

272
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,541
Have a seat, Walter.

273
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:21,047
I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman
and this plan of yours.

274
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,262
- And?
- Well, I'm not gonna do it.

275
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,640
- Why?
- Because it's moronic.

276
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,935
Saul said you've done things
like this before.

277
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:38,064
- That's not the moronic part.
- Okay. So, what's the problem?

278
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,276
The problem is
the boss wouldn't like it.

279
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,404
Saul?

280
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,908
My boss.

281
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,744
Your boss.

282
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:58,960
This is a professional courtesy.
No one knows I'm here. Understand?

283
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,464
But our employer would find out,
like always.

284
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:06,760
And if Pinkman were arrested,
he'd take it as a problem.

285
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,596
Walt...

286
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,224
...you got a good thing going here.
We all do.

287
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,269
You wanna risk it all on one junkie?

288
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,605
Now, I realize
you two have a history...

289
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:23,276
...but this kid's been on the bubble
a while now. It's a long time coming.

290
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,113
What is?

291
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,163
I used to be a beat cop,
a long time ago.

292
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,999
I'd get called on domestic disputes
all the time.

293
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,460
Hundreds, probably, over the years.

294
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:44,839
But there was this one guy, this one
piece of shit that I will never forget.

295
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:49,094
Gordie. He looked like Bo Svenson.
You remember him?

296
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,138
- Walking Tall? You don't remember?
- No.

297
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:57,310
Anyway, big boy, 270, 280...

298
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:01,689
...but his wife...
Or whatever she was... His lady...

299
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,984
...was real small. Like a bird.

300
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,779
Wrists like little branches.

301
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:12,450
Anyway, my partner and I'd
get called out there every weekend...

302
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,120
...and one of us would
pull her aside and say:

303
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,956
"Come on, tonight's the night
we press charges."

304
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,209
This wasn't one of those
"deep down, he loves me" setups.

305
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,671
We got a lot of those, but not this.
This girl was scared.

306
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,174
She wasn't gonna cross him.
No way, no how.

307
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,803
Nothing we could do but pass her
to the EMT's, put him a car...

308
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,639
...drive him downtown,
throw him in a drunk tank.

309
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,725
He sleeps it off,
next morning, out he goes.

310
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,185
Back home.

311
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,772
But one night...

312
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:47,152
...my partner's out sick,
and it's just me.

313
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,696
The call comes in
and it's the usual crap.

314
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:52,574
Broke her nose in the shower
kind of thing.

315
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,702
So I cuff him, put him in the car
and away we go.

316
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,913
Only that night...

317
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,875
...we're driving into town...

318
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:07,672
...and this sideways asshole is in
my back seat humming "Danny Boy."

319
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:12,218
And it just rubbed me wrong.

320
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:16,097
So instead of left, I go right,
out into nowhere.

321
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:20,351
And I kneel him down
and I put my revolver in his mouth...

322
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:26,566
...and I told him,
"This is it. This is how it ends."

323
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:29,861
And he's crying,
going to the bathroom all over himself.

324
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,405
Swearing to God
he's gonna leave her alone.

325
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:36,910
Screaming, much as you can
with a gun in your mouth.

326
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,913
And I told him to be quiet.

327
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,249
That I needed to think
about what I was gonna do here.

328
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,211
And, of course, he got quiet...

329
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:51,549
...goes still and real quiet.

330
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,887
Like a dog waiting for
dinner scraps.

331
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,973
Then we just stood there for a while.

332
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,936
Me, acting like
I'm thinking things over...

333
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:07,774
...and Prince Charming kneeling
in the dirt with shit in his pants.

334
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,988
And after a few minutes,
I took the gun out of his mouth...

335
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,951
...and I say, "So help me,
if you ever touch her again...

336
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:23,289
...I will such and such and such,
and blah, blah, blah."

337
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:30,296
It was just a warning?

338
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,176
Of course.

339
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,306
Just trying to do the right thing.

340
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:45,853
But two weeks later he killed her.

341
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,439
Of course.

342
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:53,653
Caved her head in
with the base of a Waring blender.

343
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:59,909
We got there, there was so much blood,
you could taste the metal.

344
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:06,124
Moral of the story is...

345
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,919
...I chose a half measure...

346
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,047
...when I should have
gone all the way.

347
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,805
I'll never make that mistake again.

348
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,817
No more half measures, Walter.

349
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,253
Man, I don't get this.

350
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:56,341
I don't get this at all.
All I'm seeing is the kid.

351
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,719
So where are they?

352
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:03,056
I don't know. They're always around.

353
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,100
Burgers are getting cold.

354
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:11,606
So is it, like, fast?

355
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,528
Don't sweat it.
You're just doing what you do.

356
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,365
Hey, nobody's gonna
know anything.

357
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,911
- Can I have another bump?
- Look, you had your bump.

358
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,039
Get this thing done,
then you can have all you want.

359
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,291
Gonna need you to come with me.

360
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,211
Take a walk.

361
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,751
Where we going?

362
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,221
Sit down.

363
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:03,027
I understand that you have a problem
with two of my employees.

364
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:07,073
It is true that they killed
one of your associates.

365
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,659
It is possible they acted rashly.

366
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,079
But, on the other hand,
there was provocation.

367
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:15,581
The man was selling
on their territory.

368
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,419
There is blame on both sides.

369
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,301
This will go no further.

370
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:31,931
It will be settled right here,
right now.

371
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,059
You told him?

372
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:39,772
Wait outside.

373
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:56,122
Listen to me. You have one friend
in this room. This man.

374
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:02,503
Those men outside
are my trusted employees.

375
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:07,133
And when I learned
what you intended to do...

376
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,513
If it wasn't for this man
and the respect I have for him...

377
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:16,183
...I would be dealing with this
in a very different way.

378
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,729
You don't look at him.
You look at me.

379
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:29,363
This is what happens now.
My men will come back inside...

380
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:34,118
...and you will shake their hands
and you will make peace.

381
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,829
And that will be the end of this.

382
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:41,834
No.

383
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,171
Jesse.

384
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:49,008
- Pardon me?
- They use kids.

385
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:53,012
These assholes got an 11 -year-old kid
doing their killing for them.

386
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,390
You're supposed to be some kind
of a reasonable businessman.

387
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,684
This how you do business?

388
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:04,357
You okay with this?
You got anything to say here?

389
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,289
Bring them back.

390
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,232
No more children.

391
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,528
Understand?

392
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,323
And you...

393
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,579
...you keep the peace.

394
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,961
Say it.

395
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,757
Yeah. I'll keep the peace.

396
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,595
Shake hands.

397
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,184
Jesse, your actions...

398
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,688
...they affect other people.

399
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:15,321
Sometimes
compromises have to be made...

400
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,533
...for the best of reasons.

401
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,006
Jesse. Jesse.

402
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:57,738
Marie, let the people
who get paid to do this do this.

403
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:01,033
The people who get paid to do this
do a lousy job.

404
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,840
So I guess this is what you want,
huh?

405
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:20,928
Just lying in a hospital bed
getting sponge baths from nurses.

406
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,763
Marie.

407
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:26,892
It's time to go home, Hank.

408
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,729
How many times I gotta tell you,
Marie? Not till I'm well.

409
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:40,072
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

410
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,615
I'm just seeing.

411
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:45,536
- Seeing what?
- Seeing what I see.

412
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:50,583
- I'm not at my best here, Marie.
- We'll see.

413
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,085
Nothing's gonna happen.

414
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:54,545
I say it will.

415
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,591
No. I'm in this bed for a reason.

416
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,303
It's a waste of time.

417
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,557
Besides, what if someone comes in?

418
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,060
- I don't care if someone walks in.
- What's wrong with you?

419
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:15,107
I'll tell you what. If I can get
the groundhog to see his shadow...

420
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,817
Not gonna happen. I'm sorry.

421
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:21,405
I'm betting it will.
And if he does, you check out of here.

422
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,076
I'm not gonna bet
on whether I can get a boner.

423
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,455
- No bet. There's no bet here. No bet.
- Afraid you'll lose?

424
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:33,292
You know, you're just...
You're just being foolish, you know?

425
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,462
Come on. What's the point?

426
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,257
The point is
you're not completely hopeless.

427
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,971
We have a bet?

428
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,515
You know what?

429
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,852
If it'll get you out of here quicker.
You got one minute.

430
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,103
- One minute?
- Yeah.

431
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,980
All right. That's a cakewalk.

432
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,982
You know, this is just...

433
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,151
This is just sad. I mean...

434
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:04,323
I really feel sorry for you,
Marie, you know? I really do. It's just...

435
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,117
- It's pathetic.
- That's good, keep talking.

436
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,496
Protest. Struggle.

437
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,792
Marie, give up.
I mean, seriously, it's...

438
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,169
...not...

439
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,296
...gonna happen.

440
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:46,365
Bad day?

441
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,245
I don't even know.

442
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,375
Anyway...

443
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,003
...it's better now.

444
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,137
Tell them you're busy.

445
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,391
Hello?

446
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,893
Grandma?

447
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,062
Slow down.

448
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,565
Slow down, I can't...

449
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:31,535
Oh, God.

450
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,315
Tomas!

451
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,776
No.

452
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:07,404
You have to let me in. Please.

453
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,793
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

454
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:25,798
Jesse, you are now 42 minutes late.

455
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:29,802
I'm starting without you.

456
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,475
- What is "wasabi"?
- Wasabi. Right you are.

457
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:37,976
Four-letter word, 1200.

458
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,313
Pilots and musicians
know this word derives from...

459
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,357
Dinner's almost ready, okay?

460
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,275
Okay.

461
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,320
- What is "solo"?
- This guy's good.

462
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,822
Four letter word, 2000.

463
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:54,368
"A loud, harsh cry,
Walt Whitman's was barbaric."

464
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,537
- "Yell."
- What is "yawp"?

465
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:57,996
- Kevin.
- What is "yawp"?

466
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,124
- Yawp.
- Tokyo, 1200.

467
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:04,294
- This crustacean...
- What the heck's a yawp?

468
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,673
A yawp is a yell. I'll be right back.

469
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:10,342
That's what I said.

470
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,555
Okay to use your bathroom, right?

471
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:17,349
Yeah, okay.

472
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:43,667
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

473
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:49,756
Look, I hope you're not waiting for an
apology because I did not rat you out.

474
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,260
I was looking out for
your best interests, as well as my own.

475
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,679
And I stand by my decision
100 percent...

476
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:59,725
...so we'll just have to agree
to disagree.

477
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,563
Anyway, just call me back.

478
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,401
- So the TV turns itself off, huh?
- Yeah.

479
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,195
I'll get it.

480
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:15,407
- The beginning of an early cold snap.
But first, more details on...

481
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,075
Where's the remote?

482
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,953
The murder of a young boy
in the South Valley.

483
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,372
Police have yet
to release a statement...

484
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,709
...but sources indicate
that 11 -year-old Tomas Cantillo...

485
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,921
...may have been the victim
of a gang-related execution.

486
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,757
An anonymous tip brought police
to a playground...

487
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:34,968
...in the 4700 block of Eighth Avenue
late last night.

488
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:39,097
Paramedics were called to the scene
but were unable to revive the boy.

489
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,100
- A gruesome crime...
- Can you turn that off?

490
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,645
Yet another casualty
in what appears to be...

491
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,980
...the city's ongoing struggle...
- Walt?

492
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:50,901
...against drugs and the gangs
that peddle them. We'll be passing...

493
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,117
Hand me your dad...

494
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:04,289
I'm sorry, it's just they've been talking
about that all day, and it's just...

495
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,458
No. Yeah.

496
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:12,464
Hey, did you know your dad and I...

497
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:15,509
...are thinking about
starting a business together?

498
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:17,678
Seriously?

499
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,639
What kind of business?

500
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:22,849
We're thinking maybe a car wash.

501
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,143
What do you mean? Like the?

502
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,982
I'm sorry, I have to go.

503
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:09,057
Oh, my God.

504
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:29,161
Run.
