1
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,204
Hey, man, look at the sad sack
I found moping around the lobby.

2
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,721
- Hey.
- Hey, there, Walt.

3
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,211
- How you doing, buddy?
- Good.

4
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,801
Listen, I'm sorry to drop in on you
out of the blue.

5
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,928
- No, no, no.
- If it's a bad time, I could--

6
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,448
No. I'm just kind of settling into the
new digs here. What do you think?

7
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,331
It is very nice.

8
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,369
- Yeah. Congratulations again.
- Yeah.

9
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,205
- We're all very proud of you.
- Oh, well, thanks.

10
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,362
My days of chasing
dirt-balls is over.

11
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,602
But I'll tell you
what, being a boss...

12
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,007
...own kind of grind,
you know what I'm saying?

13
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,802
Steve, would you mind if... I've gotta
run something by Hank, if it's all right.

14
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,043
Yeah. Yeah, hey, somebody's
gotta go chase the bad guys.

15
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,044
- Walt, it's a pleasure seeing you again.
- Thanks again, Steve.

16
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,202
- Appreciate it.
- Sure.

17
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,844
Hey. Look at that.

18
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,764
Jesus, Walt.

19
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,604
- That's nice. Let me see that.
- Yeah.

20
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,524
Wow, that's beautiful.

21
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,604
- Was it a birthday present?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,161
Well, I mean, not really.

23
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,084
I bought it for myself.

24
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,722
- Hey, well, have a seat.
- Thanks.

25
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,490
New car, new watch.

26
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,085
Good for you.

27
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,005
With all the curveballs
that were thrown at you this year...

28
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,322
...you deserve to treat yourself.

29
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,809
I mean, as long as you got
the money to spend, that is.

30
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,008
So how's Sky?

31
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,603
Actually, she went to work
this morning.

32
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,364
She wanted to.

33
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,691
She said she needed to, you know,
keep her mind occupied, and...

34
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,569
- That's good. Great, actually.
- Yeah.

35
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,361
I mean, as long as you're all right
with her being on her own and stuff.

36
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,684
Yeah, well, you know, I'm right
there with her most of the time.

37
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,447
And Mariano kind of keeps an eye
on her when I'm not, so...

38
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,647
- Good.
- Yeah.

39
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,690
And what about the whole idea
of talking to somebody?

40
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,329
You know, Marie goes off about Dave
like he's a rock star shrink, you know?

41
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,802
They come in like zombies, out
like larks, you know what I'm saying?

42
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,169
That's great.
Actually, she already found someone.

43
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,209
Yeah. Peter...

44
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,484
I don't know why I'm drawing a blank
on his last name. Peter...

45
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,610
Anyway, he's out in Rio Rancho.
He's supposed to be top-notch.

46
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,560
Good, good. I'm glad you're on it. That's
not something you wanna let fester.

47
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,451
No. No, you don't. You don't.

48
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,282
Hank, I just...

49
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,126
I wanted to thank you and Marie
for watching the kids.

50
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,282
No, it's-- It really is--

51
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,726
No, it's nice of you...

52
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,208
...and I'd like to come by tonight
and see them, if that's all right.

53
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,966
Of course. What do you mean?
You don't have to ask that.

54
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,851
It's great having them.
They're great kids.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,365
I appreciate that.

56
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,284
I do.

57
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,764
Something else
on your mind there, Walt?

58
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,207
Walt, feel free to, you know...

59
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,050
Skyler doesn't love me anymore.

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,243
And I don't know what to do, Hank.
I don't.

61
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,881
She...

62
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,521
She says that I'm a bad influence
on the kids...

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,322
...and that I'm not...

64
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,811
- Not good for them.
- Jeez, Walt.

65
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,769
No.

66
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,891
She thinks I'm a bad father.

67
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,124
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,088
Hey, I mean, Sky and you
got your issues...

69
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,966
...but that there,
that's... That's...

70
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,730
I mean, I'm no...

71
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,200
I'm not an expert on parenting or
anything, but from where I'm sitting...

72
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,522
...I just don't see it, you know?

73
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,330
I mean, I...

74
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,802
I think you're great with the kids.
I think you're great with the kids.

75
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,205
You're a provider,
a role model, you know?

76
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,530
Hell, the guts you showed
going toe-to-toe with cancer...

77
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,571
...that alone, that's an inspiration
to me, you know?

78
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,123
- No, I've made mistakes, you know?
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

79
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,931
Listen, I'm gonna get a coffee.
You want a coffee?

80
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,447
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
- I'm gonna have a cup of coffee.

81
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,321
I'm gonna give you a moment
to just get it together there.

82
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,882
You want cream and sugar?

83
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,889
Yeah, yeah. Hank, I'm sorry.

84
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,764
No, no, no.

85
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,566
That-- Cup of coffee, right?
All right.

86
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,200
Just take a moment. Take a moment.

87
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,322
You know, you two
are really great together.

88
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,488
Take it from me, buddy, it's always
darkest just before the dawn.

89
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,770
Yeah.

90
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,886
What is this place? What is this place?
What are we doing here?

91
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,769
- Get me the table.
- I can't be here.

92
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,242
My daughter, my little girl,
she's gonna be home soon.

93
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,561
What? What are you doing?

94
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,691
- Mike, Mike, Mike...
- Shut up!

95
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,802
Give me her phone.

96
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,483
All right, Lydia.

97
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,211
My friends here don't know you
like I do...

98
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,121
...so they are very kindly
giving you one last chance.

99
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,482
There's your script. Study it.

100
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,965
In about 30 seconds, I'm gonna dial
Agent Schrader on your line here...

101
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,447
...and you're gonna pass along
this information...

102
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,285
...and then we'll see what we see.
But here are the rules:

103
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,728
If you yell for help, try to give the
man some kind of coded message...

104
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,001
...or otherwise tip him off...

105
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,324
...I am gonna pull out my pistol
and shoot you in the head.

106
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,245
Same goes for panicking,
breaking down into tears.

107
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,289
Remember how you like to do that?

108
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,843
If it happens this time,
I am going to pull my pistol out...

109
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,368
...and I am going to shoot you
in the head.

110
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,965
Look at me, not at them.

111
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,767
Lydia, look at me.

112
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,641
If you make Schrader suspicious
in any way...

113
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,407
...any way at all,
tell me what's gonna happen next.

114
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,803
- You'll pull out your gun and shoot me.
- And where will I shoot you?

115
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,571
- In the head.
- In the head. That's right.

116
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,200
And it's a pistol, not a gun.

117
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,681
I'm expecting precision here.

118
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,120
We up and running?

119
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,964
Yeah. Computer's set.

120
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,645
Okay, Lydia.

121
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,044
If you ever needed to give
the performance of a lifetime...

122
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,567
...it's now.

123
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,891
You're up.

124
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,890
<i>A SA</i> C <i>'s office</i>

125
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,123
Hi. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle
calling for Agent Schrader.

126
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,845
<i>I'm sorry. What's this regarding?</i>

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,449
Madrigal Electromotive.
Lydia. Rodarte. Quayle.

128
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,768
Hold, please.

129
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,686
Hank, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle
on line one.

130
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,242
Hank Schrader.
How can I help you, Ms. Quayle?

131
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,244
Well, this is kind of an odd...

132
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,849
It's just that I was in our warehouse
supervising a shipment of chemicals...

133
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,289
...when I noticed a device on the bottom
of one of our barrels of methylamine.

134
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,290
- A device?
- Yeah. I guess you'd call it that. I mean...

135
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,169
...I'm certainly no expert, but it
looks to me like some kind of a...

136
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,443
A tracking device or a GPS.

137
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,085
So I was just wondering
if maybe your people put it there.

138
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,881
Not that it's any of my business, but
the last thing I wanna do is interfere...

139
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,607
...with a law enforcement operation
or a sting...

140
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,649
...or whatever you call it.

141
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,447
So, I don't know...

142
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,001
...maybe you could
give me some guidance?

143
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,288
Well, I'll tell you what.

144
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,488
Set that barrel aside for me,
if you would...

145
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,921
...and I'll look into it
and get back to you.

146
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,482
And in the meantime,
mum's the word, all right?

147
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,529
Yeah. All right. Sure thing.

148
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,887
<i>Okay, great.
Thanks for the call, Ms. Quayle.</i>

149
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,804
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

150
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,642
Hey, Gomey, come here, would you?

151
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,765
- Yeah?
- Hey, man.

152
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,641
<i>You know anything about GPS trackers
on a methylamine barrel?</i>

153
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,529
<i>Madrigal Houston, I'm talking about.</i>

154
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,251
<i>Nope. Nobody from my team
planted anything. Why?</i>

155
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,370
<i>Oh, I don't know. I figured as much.</i>

156
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,568
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

157
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,322
I know what you're thinking,
but I didn't do it.

158
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,643
- I'm telling you, I didn't plant that thing.
- Shut up.

159
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,208
And there you have it, like I said.

160
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,362
All right. So now what?

161
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,281
It's not the DEA's, so Schrader's
probably thinking some crew planted it...

162
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,482
...looking for a weak spot
to pull a heist.

163
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,768
He's gonna send a team
over to that warehouse.

164
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,766
He's gonna wire it out the wazoo.
Bugs, cameras, the whole nine yards.

165
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,684
So the warehouse is too hot.

166
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,286
Her supply is useless to us now.

167
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,728
It depends on how fast Schrader
can get his guys there.

168
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,042
We're 900 miles closer, after all.

169
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,409
I say we keep listening,
suss out how much time we have.

170
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,006
If it's at least 12 hours,
then we head down there...

171
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,128
...use her security code
to gain access...

172
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,089
...and we take every barrel we can.

173
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,847
U-Haul can only take six or seven
before the suspension gives out.

174
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,049
It's a stopgap. But right now,
it's the best we can do.

175
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,691
Well, what about her?

176
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,844
You two drive the
barrels back tonight.

177
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,726
I'll deal with her.

178
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,486
No! No, no, no.
You're making a mistake.

179
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,371
This was not me!
I swear to God I didn't do it!

180
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,171
I don't know. Sounds like she's
telling the truth to me.

181
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,290
She has a gun to her head, kid.

182
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,171
Everyone sounds like Meryl Streep
with a gun to their head.

183
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,209
I'm sorry, Jesse.

184
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,570
You're the one who wanted
to put it up to a vote.

185
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,808
It's two against one.

186
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,646
No. No! You can't kill me! Come on!

187
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,246
I swear I didn't do anything!

188
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,165
<i>Janice, give me Doughty
in the Houston office, will you?</i>

189
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,924
<i>You got it.</i>

190
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,449
<i>Hank Schrader for Mr. Doughty.</i>

191
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,809
<i>He's on the line.</i>

192
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,567
<i>Hey, Erol. Please tell me you guys
didn't do something as lamebrained...</i>

193
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,361
<i>...as put a GPS tracker on the
outside of a barrel of methylamine.</i>

194
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,444
<i>One earmarked for the
Madrigal warehouse in Houston?</i>

195
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,161
<i>Who's asking?
Did someone find them?</i>

196
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,369
<i>Jesus. Are you shitting me?
Since when do you put a GPS tracker...</i>

197
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,330
<i>- ...on the outside of a barrel?
- We didn't have time to go in...</i>

198
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,926
<i>...with hazard suits, Hank.
They were about to ship.</i>

199
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,481
<i>We epoxied them to the bottom.
They were well-hidden.</i>

200
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,287
<i>Oh, really? Well, not well-hidden
enough. How many barrels you tag?</i>

201
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,324
<i>All of them. All the ones
headed to the warehouse, anyway.</i>

202
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,321
<i>Christ. All right. Well, sit tight.
Let me figure out how to play this.</i>

203
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,926
<i>Next time, a little
communication first, all right?</i>

204
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,970
<i>- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
- Asshole.</i>

205
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,729
Aside-- Aside from the fact...

206
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,602
...that we almost killed this woman,
all of those barrels are already marked.

207
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,569
We solve the problem we can.

208
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,564
This has not changed the equation
one iota for her.

209
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,560
Oh, come on! You are not seriously
still considering killing me?

210
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,969
I saved you! If it weren't for me,
we'd all be in jail right now.

211
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,567
I hate to say it,
but she's right, Mike.

212
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,690
She saved our asses
by finding that thing.

213
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,844
She is saving herself.
She's a loose cannon.

214
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,688
I am telling you, she will turn a gun or
a badge on us the first chance she gets.

215
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,409
The woman put a hit out on me.

216
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,241
Seriously?

217
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,331
Wait. A hit? What? Like the mafia?

218
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,241
Yeah, like the mafia.

219
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,847
Hey! You still need methylamine,
don't you? Right?

220
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,240
You wanna talk methylamine?

221
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,086
Then tell your partner to stop
threatening me, and let's talk.

222
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,561
Talk about what? You heard.

223
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,848
You can't even get
us a single barrel.

224
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,002
Who said anything about barrels?

225
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,960
I'm talking about an ocean
of the stuff.

226
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,767
Just give him a minute, would you?

227
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,763
Trust him.

228
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,126
"Trust him."

229
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,731
Okay. So, let's hear it.

230
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,242
Not without a guarantee that once
I tell you how to get what you want...

231
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,609
- ...I won't be killed anyway.
- Fine. You have my word.

232
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,041
- Not good enough.
- Look, lady--

233
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,046
- Do you have children?
- That has nothing to do with this.

234
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,807
It's not a trick question.
Why don't you just answer it?

235
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,850
Yes, I have children. So what?

236
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,401
You think that somehow
because we're both parents...

237
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,881
...that I won't let my partner
do what's necessary?

238
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,644
- Swear on their lives.
- Oh, what?

239
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,326
Swear on your children's lives
that I won't be harmed.

240
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,369
Otherwise, how can I trust you?

241
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,002
Look, you're a smart businesswoman.

242
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,003
You understand the concept
of leverage.

243
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,767
- Please don't patronize me. I hate that.
- You have none.

244
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,168
But trust has to work
both ways, Lydia.

245
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,210
Is it true that you put
a hit out on Mike?

246
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,643
- Yes.
- Why?

247
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,006
I was scared.

248
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,329
- Of Mike?
- Not at first.

249
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,324
There are men who used to work
with Gus Fring in custody now.

250
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,324
Nine of them. They know everything
about me. Everything.

251
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,768
Some of them even know about you,
assuming you're the master chemist...

252
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,161
...they're always talking about.

253
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,326
And if it's these nine
that you're worried about...

254
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,687
- ...why put the hit on Mike?
- I had no choice.

255
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,407
I'm not going to prison and have my
daughter raised in a group home.

256
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,881
Do you have any idea
what those places are like?

257
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,804
I gave him a list of names...

258
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,327
...but instead of handling it,
he's protecting them.

259
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,324
So I hired someone else.
At that point, there was no option...

260
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,209
...but to add Mike to the list.

261
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,884
This ocean of methylamine...

262
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,089
...that you claim
you can get your hands on...

263
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,528
...how much are we
talking about, literally?

264
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,650
How does 24,000 gallons sound?

265
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,721
Once a week, on a Wednesday, a freight
train leaves the Port of Long Beach...

266
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,843
...loaded with industrial chemicals.

267
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,890
There's always at least one
tanker car full of methylamine...

268
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,520
...which we import from
a manufacturer in Guangzhou.

269
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,166
The train travels east
through Arizona...

270
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,322
...stops at a rail yard
outside Flagstaff...

271
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,201
...where it gets broken down and rebuilt.
But the methylamine always moves on...

272
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,204
...destined for our pesticide
concerns in Texas and Oklahoma.

273
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,204
Which means that it passes
right through your home state.

274
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,406
There's a remote three-mile stretch
here in McKinley County.

275
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,483
That's where you do it.

276
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,246
That's where we do what exactly?

277
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,640
Get your methylamine.

278
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,691
- Like, rob it? Like Jesse James?
- You want the stuff?

279
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,047
I'm offering you enough
to fill a swimming pool.

280
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,568
You are offering us a quick trip
to prison. That's what I'm hearing.

281
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,961
Stopping a train, post 9/11?

282
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,364
You have any idea how many alarms
that'll set off between here and D.C.?

283
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,286
None, if you do it right here.
If a freight train is stopped in transit...

284
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,841
...anywhere other than
the usual yards or depots...

285
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,766
...absolutely, a signal will alarm
the FRA and the TSA Surface Division...

286
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,083
...at the Department of Homeland
Security. But what you don't know...

287
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,961
...and I do, because my job requires me
to keep track of my buyers' shipments...

288
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,441
...this is dark territory.

289
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,171
- What's that?
- Train-speak for an area of no contact.

290
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,970
It's a dead zone.

291
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,484
No automated supervision system
no alarms, no contact with control.

292
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,846
What about cell phones?

293
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,691
- Crew could just call the cops.
- No cellular either.

294
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,690
I'm telling you, it's
the perfect place.

295
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,882
You'd have time enough
to stop the train...

296
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,441
...siphon off as much methylamine
as you can carry...

297
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,002
- ...get away before the police are called.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

298
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,004
Assuming we can stop
a moving train...

299
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,528
...how do we know we have the right
one? And which tanker car is which?

300
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,286
I can't believe that they would
advertise their contents.

301
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,687
Once the train gets
rebuilt in Flagstaff...

302
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,491
...a final manifest gets uploaded
to my company's server.

303
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,689
I'll have it for you sometime
between midnight and <i>2</i> a.m.

304
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,525
That'll give you at least
six hours of lead time.

305
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,847
Keep in mind, I'm taking a huge risk
supplying this information.

306
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,280
I expect to be paid.

307
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,563
We can talk percentages later.

308
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,882
You know what this means, don't you?

309
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,485
We've gotta off the crew.

310
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,605
How do you figure?

311
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,121
If we don't, the engineer's
gonna call the cops...

312
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,602
...as soon as he gets out of the
dead zone. It's only three miles long.

313
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,730
- We're way out in the boonies.
- I don't care if it's in the Gobi Desert.

314
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,326
Once they get word,
the FBI and Homeland Security...

315
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,366
...are gonna swoop down with choppers
on us so fast, it'll make our heads spin.

316
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,966
And there is no hiding
in that open country.

317
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,009
- How many in the crew?
- Just two.

318
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,363
- An engineer and a conductor.
- Assuming there are no security guards.

319
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,285
No guards. It's not like
we're carrying nuclear warheads.

320
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,442
Wait. Two guys.

321
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,602
Can't we just tie
them up or something?

322
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,527
And then what? Even if we wear a mask,
we're leaving two witnesses behind.

323
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,401
Bottom line, I have done this
long enough to know...

324
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,404
...that there are
two kinds of heists:

325
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,370
Those where the guys
get away with it...

326
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,091
...and those that leave witnesses.

327
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,889
Give me a break.
You guys were gonna murder me.

328
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,407
I thought you were professionals.

329
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,403
Can you say "ASAC"?

330
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,642
"ASAC." Can you say that?

331
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,167
Say, "ASAC Schrader."

332
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,370
If those turn out to be her first
words, I will beat you with my shoe.

333
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,445
- Don't listen to him, Holly.
- I'm just telling it like it is, babe.

334
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,967
Boss man. I'm the boss man.

335
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,202
Say, "Boss man."

336
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,806
Am I the boss man? I'm the boss.

337
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,407
Hey, that better be something from
a boob instead of some fake soy crap.

338
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,040
- Yeah, yeah.
- My little girl...

339
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,601
- Your little girl.
- ...deserves the real McCoy.

340
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,921
- No. See?
- Okay.

341
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,845
She doesn't want it.
No, she wants me.

342
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,604
She wants me.

343
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,246
Yeah, my little girl,
because I'm not giving her back.

344
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,731
Yeah, I know.

345
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,885
What about Emo McGee?

346
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,804
Has he come out
of his room today?

347
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,325
Barely.

348
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,130
When he does, he barely talks.

349
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,528
Yeah, well, what do you expect,
you know?

350
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,809
His parents treat him
like he's a baby there.

351
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,809
Flynn, do you want me to heat up
some of that lasagne...

352
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,689
...to hold you over till dinner?

353
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,001
No.

354
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,807
Hey, I picked up <i>Heat</i> on Blu-ray.
Wanna watch it with me later?

355
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,922
No. And you can keep
talking about me now.

356
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,850
Well, if no one else is gonna
offer an opinion, I will.

357
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,764
We do it the old-fashioned way.

358
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,367
We hit skid row, the Crystal Palace,
all the halfway houses...

359
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,161
...scrounge up about a dozen skells,
put them to work smurfing cold pills.

360
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,163
You mean switch back
to a pseudo cook.

361
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,086
You're the chemist. Admittedly,
it's gonna cut down on our output.

362
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,641
Like a factor of four or five.

363
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,003
It also means
that we will eat $80,000...

364
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,527
...we just invested
in our new lab equipment...

365
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,121
...which is only
good for a P2P cook.

366
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,681
You know, I don't have to do
the math to know...

367
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,002
...that we'd be making
a fraction of the profit.

368
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,563
And making less money
is better than making nothing.

369
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,010
Oh, yeah, Mike?
Well, why don't you tell us why?

370
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,329
Why is making nothing
not an option?

371
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,084
- Walter--
- Let me tell you why.

372
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,402
It's because of your nine guys
in lockup, right?

373
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,246
You broke it, you pay for it. And we've
talked about this plenty already.

374
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,767
Well, maybe we better
talk about it a little more...

375
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,567
...because what it sounds like you're
telling me, Mike, is that from now on...

376
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,485
...we have no choice but to do
this piddling pseudo cook...

377
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,722
...so that we can pay back
your guys.

378
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,168
Or else what? Or else they're gonna
rat on us, and we end up in prison.

379
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,369
Yeah? And it sounds like
what you're telling me, Walter...

380
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,961
...is that you wanna
do this heist...

381
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,090
...even if it means killing
a couple of innocent men.

382
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,004
That what you want?

383
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,441
You know, I don't know why you insist
on putting words in my mouth here.

384
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,640
What if we can rip off that train,
and no one ever knows it got robbed?

385
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,208
Maybe.

386
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,405
Just maybe.

387
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,327
It'll come from that direction.

388
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,082
Seven seventy-five.

389
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,250
Eight hundred.

390
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,480
Eight fourteen.

391
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,649
Wait a minute.

392
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,645
It's perfect. Yeah, we do it here.

393
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,800
We do it right here.

394
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,808
How are we looking, Mike?

395
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,010
All clear.

396
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,690
<i>Copy that.</i>

397
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,486
Go down, go down.

398
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,006
You got it. That's good, Fernando.

399
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,482
Hey.

400
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,571
- This one.
- Right.

401
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,764
- You good?
- Yeah.

402
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,523
- What's your name again?
- Todd.

403
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,241
Todd, on the day, are you gonna
be able to make this climb?

404
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,801
Yes, sir. I'll be ready.

405
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,168
All right.

406
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,250
- You mind if I ask you a question?
- No. Go ahead.

407
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,880
Well, I get why we want the tank
for the methylamine.

408
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,769
But why this other
one for the water?

409
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,249
Well...

410
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,690
Jesse, it's your idea.

411
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,683
You wanna fill him in?

412
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,963
It's all about the weight, yo.

413
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,011
The tanker we're gonna hit gets weighed
when it gets loaded in Long Beach...

414
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,369
...and then again
when it's unloaded in Texas.

415
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,284
If the weights don't match...

416
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,681
...the train company's
gonna know it got robbed.

417
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,887
Okay.

418
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,089
Boosting methylamine from a train
is, like, a major rap.

419
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,486
The point is, no one other than us can
ever know that this robbery went down.

420
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,484
Nobody. You got it?

421
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,842
Yeah. Absolutely.

422
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,206
Are you sure?

423
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,089
Yes, sir.

424
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,165
With all that said,
the whole thing relies on us...

425
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,961
...replacing the weight of methylamine
we steal with the same weight in water.

426
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,202
So they'll never know
we hit them. Cool.

427
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,405
Aqueous methylamine is water-based,
yet it weighs slightly less than water.

428
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,930
We will be removing a thousand gallons
of methylamine from the tanker car...

429
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,523
...but replacing it with about
nine-tenths of that volume in water...

430
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,526
...which comes to 900.24 gallons.

431
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,043
Actually, Jesse,
let's make that an even 920...

432
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,170
...to account for spillage and
whatever will remain in the hose.

433
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,891
- Yeah.
- How we doing, by the way?

434
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,408
- Eight fifty. We're almost there.
- All right.

435
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,042
Won't they figure they got robbed,
getting watered-down methylamine?

436
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,487
Well, out of 24,000 gallons...

437
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,407
...it'll only amount to about
four percent dilution, so...

438
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,484
But, yes, you're right.
They will notice.

439
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,281
At which point,
they will blame China...

440
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,887
...for sending
a marginally weaker batch.

441
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,484
Damn, you guys thought
of everything.

442
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,650
Flynn.

443
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,762
Flynn, open the door.

444
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,851
Just come out and talk to me.

445
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,447
I'm staying.
That's all I have to say.

446
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,363
- What's going on?
- You got what you wanted, that's what.

447
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,082
Congratulations.

448
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,523
It's me. Open up.

449
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,647
Come on, Junior.
I'm not gonna ask twice.

450
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,205
What?

451
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,408
You know what.

452
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,245
Are you seriously kicking me out
of my own house?

453
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,004
Are you seriously doing that?

454
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,447
We are not kicking you
out of anywhere, son.

455
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,611
We love you. And this is your house
as much as it is ours.

456
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,570
But your mom and I need some time
alone, and you know that.

457
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,485
- We explained that to you.
- You haven't explained jack shit.

458
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,610
You want me out?
Explain to me why.

459
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,524
Why do I have to go
to Uncle Hank's?

460
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,684
Give me the exact reason
or I'm not going anywhere.

461
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,164
This is not gonna be a debate.

462
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,965
What's going on?

463
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,122
Why can't anybody tell me anything?

464
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,045
I want one good reason.

465
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,604
Because we're your parents
and you're our child.

466
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,565
That's reason enough.
Now, please, do as I ask.

467
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,650
Now.

468
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,485
It'll pass. He'll understand.

469
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,041
Don't start, Walt.

470
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,806
I won't change my mind about you.

471
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,889
Even

472
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,008
Well, I don't accept that.
You're my wife.

473
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,249
I'm not your wife, I'm your hostage.

474
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,131
But since you insist
on keeping me imprisoned...

475
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,725
...I'll make you a deal.

476
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,561
I will launder your money,
I'll keep your secrets...

477
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,405
...but the kids will stay
at Hank and Marie's...

478
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,325
...where they have
a chance of being safe.

479
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,125
I think you've seen too many movies.

480
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,646
Our children are not in danger.

481
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,002
Just a couple of days ago...

482
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,606
...you told me that a man
held a gun to your head.

483
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,969
You said it like it
was a point of pride.

484
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,441
There's nothing you can say
that'll convince me...

485
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,649
...there won't come a day that
somebody will knock on that door...

486
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,201
...looking to harm you or me
or all of us.

487
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,570
And when that day comes,
the children cannot be here.

488
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,767
You agree to that...

489
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,083
...and I will be whatever kind
of partner you want me to be.

490
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,803
Okay.

491
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,802
By the way...

492
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,003
...you're visiting a therapist
from Rio Rancho. Peter.

493
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,201
Last name is up to you.

494
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,328
Out burying bodies?

495
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,048
Robbing a train.

496
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,082
<i>- Yeah?
- It's me.</i>

497
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,649
I've got it.

498
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,320
Okay, Mr. White, everything's set.

499
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,970
Hey, Wallace! Up ahead!

500
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,961
Stop the train now!

501
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,604
S'[Op!

502
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,966
Stop the train!

503
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,008
Now. Go, go, go.

504
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,484
Jesus. Thank God you guys
weren't asleep at the switch.

505
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,847
It'd be like pancake city out here.

506
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,168
Man.

507
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,163
Hey, you believe this?

508
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,369
I mean, shit fire
and save the matches.

509
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,761
Talk about bum luck.

510
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,329
Hey, man, I'm sorry to
put you guys out like this.

511
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,845
What's the trouble with it?

512
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,923
No clue. I was just driving
down the road.

513
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,845
All of a sudden, the old cow
just bellied up and died on me.

514
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,970
Either one of you guys know about
engines? Oh, of course you do.

515
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,010
That's why they call you
an engineer, right?

516
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,801
- All right.
- Think it's...

517
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,689
Think it's in there or something.

518
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,887
- You think?
- Yeah.

519
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,202
Probably a pretty good bet.

520
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,408
When was the last time
you changed the oil?

521
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,210
I don't know, man. I just drive it.

522
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,326
- Now. Go, go, go.
- We're on.

523
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,441
- Good?
- Yeah.

524
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,761
Go!

525
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,529
It looks good up here.

526
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,330
Now, hold up. There it is.

527
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,767
I think this is the one.

528
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,965
- We good?
- Yeah.

529
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,686
Hey, you wanna get in there,
give it a whirl?

530
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,808
All right, let me give it a try.

531
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,806
- Ready?
- Ready.

532
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,488
- Nothing?
- Try again.

533
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,526
- Nothing.
- All right.

534
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,000
Maybe if we all pushed?

535
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,008
All right. It's worth a try.

536
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,248
Any other ideas,
you just shout them out.

537
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,482
Not at the moment, I don't.

538
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,284
You coming?

539
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,369
So far, so good.

540
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,369
Give me a status.

541
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,610
We're at 300 gallons and counting.

542
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,649
Water is going...

543
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,004
Now.

544
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,084
Water's going in now.
We're going with water now.

545
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,447
- Good?
- Yeah.

546
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,364
All right.

547
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,851
One, two, three.

548
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,931
You did remember
to put it in neutral, right?

549
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,730
Yeah, man. Give me a little credit.

550
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,490
You sure you're not out of gas?

551
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,086
I got a full tank here.

552
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,045
Yeah, this doesn't make any sense.
Everything looks good.

553
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,404
Why don't we just
keep going over it?

554
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,444
There's gotta be
something loose somewhere.

555
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,361
Damn, buddy. Picked a hell
of a place to break down.

556
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,444
I know, right? Crazy.
Hey, you know anything about engines?

557
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,922
Not a whole lot. I can push you off
the tracks at least.

558
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,242
Gee, I wouldn't want you
to mess up your ride.

559
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,882
- I'll go slow. Won't get a scratch.
- You'll screw up your nice shiny bumper.

560
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,402
Hey. We're running late because of you.
The man said it was no problem.

561
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,767
Come on already.
And thank you, by the way.

562
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,645
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely, pal. Thanks.

563
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,242
Jesus. Walter, we've got
a Good Samaritan on the scene.

564
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,846
You pull your guys
off that train right now.

565
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,490
We're not done yet.

566
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,768
The track is clear, Walter.
I said get out of there.

567
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,682
- Thank you, mister. Much obliged.
- Glad we could work that out for you.

568
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,445
- Yeah, no problem.
- You want a ride into town?

569
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,961
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

570
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,329
Walter, they are back
in the locomotive.

571
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,007
<i>If you do not abort right now,
you are gonna get us all busted.</i>

572
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,688
- Ready?
- Yeah.

573
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,130
Mr. White!

574
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,280
Hey!

575
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,250
Hold it! Hold it steady!

576
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,689
Now!

577
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,050
Close it off! Close it off!

578
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,969
Todd! Get off! Get off!

579
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,883
Yeah, bitch!

580
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,930
- We did it.
- Oh, yeah!

581
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,969
Oh, my...

582
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,483
- Okay, okay. Nice job.
- Yeah!

583
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,010
No! No! No!

584
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,970
No.
