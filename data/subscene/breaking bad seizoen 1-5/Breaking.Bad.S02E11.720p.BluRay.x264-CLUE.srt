1
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,417
- What's up?
- How's it going?

2
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,841
All right.

3
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:08,284
What you need?

4
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:13,873
You buying
or you just stopping to envy?

5
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:20,629
Yeah. Punk bitches.

6
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:07,510
<i>Please leave your message
for 505-127-5223.</i>

00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:10,679
<i>Record your message after the tone.

8
00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:12,014
Bounce, little man.

9
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:15,726
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,
getting eyeballed hard.

10
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,187
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

11
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,689
Get your ass up here now.

12
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:27,488
- What's that thing in your ear?
- What did I say? Get out of here!

13
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:30,699
What are you waiting for? Go!

14
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:40,269
Well, Walt, we've made such headway
with your treatments...

15
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:43,689
...that now it's time we talked about
sealing the deal.

16
00:03:43,898 --> 00:03:45,149
Absolutely.

17
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:46,734
As you know...

18
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:49,945
...my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

19
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,908
That may no longer be the case.

20
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:58,621
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

21
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,623
Maybe a pretty good option.

22
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:03,501
Dr. Bravenec is one of
the few surgeons in the country...

23
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,295
...performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

24
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:08,839
He's got a good track record.

25
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,633
Pretty good.

26
00:04:11,342 --> 00:04:13,385
It sounds...

27
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:15,805
...aggressive.

28
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:18,140
Yes. Very much so.

29
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:21,143
Understand that
if you don't have this surgery...

30
00:04:21,352 --> 00:04:23,646
...you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

31
00:04:23,854 --> 00:04:25,981
And it will.

32
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:29,860
Through the treatment you've had,
we've bought you some time.

33
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,155
Maybe a lot, probably a little...

34
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:35,825
...but that's all.

35
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,827
In my opinion...

36
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:40,329
...if you're willing to take some risk...

37
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:42,665
...then this offers the best chance.

38
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:53,259
How much would it cost?
I mean, I'm not on your insurance.

39
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:56,262
I'd say between 170-...

40
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,889
...and 200,000, all in.

41
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,685
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can...

42
00:05:02,893 --> 00:05:05,688
...but mine isn't even
the biggest expense.

43
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:11,360
This is obviously a big decision...

44
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:14,864
...and you folks are gonna wanna
take some time to discuss it.

45
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:17,283
No.

46
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,743
I'll do it.

47
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,712
Walt, don't you think we should
at least talk this through first?

48
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:34,008
I just think it's the way to go.

49
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:41,390
I have to say,
I think it's the right choice.

50
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:44,685
I recommend
that we let the pneumonitis heal...

51
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:46,687
...for another couple of weeks...

52
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:49,190
...and then we'll have at it.

53
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:52,651
That's tricky.

54
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:58,908
- When's the due date?
- It's the 21 st.

55
00:05:59,116 --> 00:06:00,451
So two weeks and change?

56
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:02,870
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

57
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:06,207
That way Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

58
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:09,752
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

59
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,755
Yeah.

60
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:32,441
Fourteen messages...

61
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,527
God.

62
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:39,073
<i>- Yeah.
- It's me.</i>

63
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:42,701
<i>Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.</i>

64
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,286
Working.

65
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:45,830
What is it?

66
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,584
Combo's dead.

67
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,795
<i>Shot.</i>

68
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:55,631
Which one is he?

69
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:58,467
You did not just say that to me.

70
00:06:58,676 --> 00:07:01,137
<i>- Jesse, listen--
- That figures.</i>

71
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:15,443
What's the word on the street?

72
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,279
No one's dropping no names.

73
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:21,657
Combo rang me before it went down,
said dudes were mad-dogging him...

74
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:25,661
...trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

75
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:31,167
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean...

76
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,169
...what'd you expect?

77
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:35,713
I don't know.

78
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,590
You don't know?

79
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:40,634
Is that all you got?

80
00:07:41,886 --> 00:07:44,680
I'll do right by Combo's people.

81
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:51,145
But make sure you bust up your cell
and toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.

82
00:07:53,397 --> 00:07:56,025
I appreciate what
you're saying and all...

83
00:07:56,233 --> 00:08:00,654
...but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali...

84
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,115
I'm on probation, man.

85
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:06,202
Fast track to Los Lunas.

86
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,789
We're on the verge...

87
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:14,210
...of making some serious coin,
Skinny.

88
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:16,879
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

89
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:22,718
This game we playing? We don't got
the street cred to survive it.

90
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:25,679
Back when everyone thought
you killed Spooge...

91
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:28,766
...maybe we were doing okay,
but that whole...

92
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:32,269
- ...thing to the head thing, the ATM?
- Yeah?

93
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,230
His junkie bitch copped to it.

94
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:37,399
Whole town knows it wasn't you.

95
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:43,906
Everyone knows?

96
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:49,745
- Why didn't you say something?
- I don't know, man.

97
00:08:49,954 --> 00:08:51,413
Because we like you and all.

98
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:54,750
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

99
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:56,919
We'll get by.

100
00:08:57,128 --> 00:09:00,923
- All right? We'll make it.
- Sorry, Jesse.

101
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:03,259
I'm out.

102
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:17,148
We have had a bit of a setback.

103
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:21,360
That's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

104
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:24,363
- How about "your fault"?
- No, no, don't lay that on me.

105
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:27,741
- You are in charge of distribution.
- You said expand the territory.

106
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,369
- Doesn't mean you become careless.
- Guys, guys! Hey!

107
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:33,456
Do I look like Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counsellor.

108
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:36,292
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

109
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,544
Now, setback. Go.

110
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:42,840
One of our dealers was murdered.

111
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:47,970
It was some kind of turf dispute...

112
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:50,306
...and apparently we lost.

113
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:52,224
And then everyone quit on us.

114
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:56,312
I mean,
we have absolutely no distribution.

115
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,981
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

116
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,233
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

117
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,988
Well, there's your silver lining.

118
00:10:06,197 --> 00:10:08,991
How about you?
How's the health situation?

119
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,495
It's better. Do you mind?

120
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:14,163
Better?

121
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:17,541
Yeah, it's...

122
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:23,798
...looking a little more positive.

123
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:25,758
I may have more time than I thought.

124
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:27,802
Outstanding.

125
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,304
Now, as to your dead guy:

126
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:32,306
occupational hazard.

127
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:33,766
Drug dealer getting shot?

128
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:38,020
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

129
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:41,315
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

130
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,694
Thirty-eight and change.

131
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:47,780
Thirty-eight ounces? Grams?

132
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:49,198
Pounds.

133
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:54,662
You did say make hay
while the sun is shining.

134
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,956
Guys!

135
00:10:57,164 --> 00:10:59,041
Why the long faces here?

136
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,377
You're sitting on a gold mine.

137
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:03,671
A gold mine we can't sell.

138
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,173
We need a proper infrastructure.

139
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:08,717
We need foot soldiers
and we need dealers...

140
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:10,761
...on a street level
that are rock solid.

141
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,056
We need muscle
and we need enforcers.

142
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:16,225
Payback. That's what we need.

143
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:22,898
God.

144
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:28,028
I mean, this entire process
has just been so...

145
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,077
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

146
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:37,788
We need your help.

147
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:42,084
Look, let's start with
some tough love, all right?

148
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:43,961
Ready for this? Here goes.

149
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,090
You two suck at peddling meth.
Period.

150
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:50,760
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

151
00:11:50,968 --> 00:11:53,387
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

152
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:58,017
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

153
00:11:58,225 --> 00:12:00,436
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

154
00:12:00,644 --> 00:12:03,272
What, some tattooed speed freak?

155
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:06,901
No. What you two need
is an honest-to-God businessman.

156
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:08,903
Somebody who treats your product...

157
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:12,490
...like the simple
high-margin commodity that it is.

158
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,910
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

159
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:20,456
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

160
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,293
You know someone like that?

161
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:28,464
Let's just say I know a guy
who knows a guy.

162
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:30,549
Who knows another guy.

163
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:34,595
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

164
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,641
Well, what's his name?

165
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:41,435
I have no idea.

166
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:46,107
He's very low profile.
He's careful like that.

167
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:49,443
You know,
from what I do hear about him...

168
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:51,654
...he sounds a little like you.

169
00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:59,453
<i>And McDonald tabletops it, lands it.</i>

170
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,248
<i>He's coming to the end
and he's got the big fist pump.</i>

171
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:05,501
<i>Now Mueller's coming.
Oh, a double! Here he comes.</i>

172
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:09,255
<i>And he's coming to the end
and he takes second.</i>

173
00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:11,507
I need you to leave.

174
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:22,476
Look, there's...

175
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:26,564
...some stuff about me
you don't know and...

176
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,111
Like you're a drug dealer?

177
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:35,448
I kind of got that.

178
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:40,786
You pay in cash
and you use an alias, so...

179
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:49,545
One of my guys...

180
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,132
...a friend who worked for me...

181
00:13:54,258 --> 00:13:55,509
...got murdered.

182
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,638
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

183
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:05,561
I'm gonna smoke some crystal
and I just think you should go...

184
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,815
...being that you're in a programme
and all and...

185
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,862
You could come with me
to a meeting.

186
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:18,491
No.

187
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,202
No meetings.

188
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:25,664
We could just get out of here.

189
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:32,338
- It won't help.
- Yeah, it will.

190
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:35,007
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't.

191
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:36,759
I just...

192
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:40,721
All right, I really just need you to go.

193
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:50,332
Sir? Enjoy your meal.

194
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,126
Thank you.

195
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:25,075
You're late.

196
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:27,870
Yeah.

197
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:30,873
We're in the big time now.

198
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:33,793
So where's the kingpin?

199
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:37,213
Your guess is as good as mine.

200
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,385
So you get the dude's name?

201
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:45,221
Nope.

202
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:48,682
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names...

203
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:51,977
...what we look like,
but not the other way around?

204
00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:57,566
Why don't you get yourself
some food?

205
00:16:57,775 --> 00:17:00,027
So we won't both sit here
with our Happy Meals...

206
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:01,904
...looking like a couple chumps?

207
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:04,907
Gentlemen,
is everything to your satisfaction?

208
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:06,659
Fine, thanks.

209
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:11,872
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

210
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,166
I don't get you, man.

211
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:18,170
A week ago you talked like
you were all ready to hang it up.

212
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,716
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

213
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:24,677
Yeah, what about after?

214
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:28,264
After you gonna make up
some new magic number?

215
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:30,933
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

216
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:33,269
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

217
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:37,064
- Things have changed.
- Oh, I know.

218
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:39,692
We got a guy killed.

219
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,030
You know what?

220
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,741
This is bullshit.

221
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:50,786
- I'm out of here.
- Hey.

222
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:03,799
I think she's waking up from a nap.

223
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:07,428
She is certainly gonna wanna get out
and stretch those legs soon.

224
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:13,642
We have to keep an eye
on your fluids.

225
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:15,519
You're on the low side of normal.

226
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,314
What? How low?

227
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:21,650
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

228
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:25,362
We'll have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

229
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,324
Hey.

230
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:30,659
Oh, man,
you would not believe the traffic.

231
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:32,828
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

232
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:35,039
- Sorry. Hi.
- Hi.

233
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,666
- What did I miss?
- For your refrigerator.

234
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,960
Oh, my God.

235
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:41,378
Look at her.

236
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,005
- Look.
- Yeah.

237
00:18:43,214 --> 00:18:45,841
God. It's like she's here already.

238
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,637
I was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

239
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:52,056
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

240
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,183
It's time to make a decision.

241
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:57,520
- You know what I'm gonna say.
- The C-section?

242
00:18:57,728 --> 00:18:59,980
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

243
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:06,112
Well, my last labour
was pretty tough, so...

244
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,240
For the baby, I say yes.

245
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,201
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

246
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:16,705
It's best we take her a little early.
So why don't we schedule it for...

247
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:18,374
...a week from Friday?

248
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:23,045
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

249
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:29,593
We have a birthday.

250
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:31,637
The 16th.

251
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:33,973
- I like it.
- Yeah.

252
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,476
You know, speaking of birthdays...

253
00:19:37,685 --> 00:19:41,230
...I've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

254
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,233
It's an hour before closing.

255
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:46,485
You're supposed to be
taking it easy.

256
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:48,904
We're having a get-together
for Ted's birthday...

257
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:50,739
...and I've gotta pick up the cake.

258
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,491
Why you?

259
00:19:53,451 --> 00:19:57,204
Because I said I would...?

260
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,999
It is the least I can do.

261
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,127
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.

262
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,712
- Bye.
- Bye.

263
00:20:53,511 --> 00:20:55,304
Let's get out of here.

264
00:20:55,513 --> 00:20:57,723
You know, go do something.

265
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,018
Seriously.

266
00:21:01,352 --> 00:21:04,647
You know that museum in Santa Fe
you talked about?

267
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,191
Let's take a drive.

268
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:12,822
Sure.

269
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,301
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's been drilled, it's been cut.

270
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,429
We're halfway through the job.

271
00:21:37,012 --> 00:21:41,517
<i>Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.
Mr. Beneke to the shop.</i>

272
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:45,312
All right.
Just let me think about it, okay?

273
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:46,772
I gotta go.

274
00:21:46,981 --> 00:21:48,983
Dean, I gotta go.

275
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:51,360
Okay, all right.

276
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:57,199
Happy birthday!

277
00:21:58,075 --> 00:21:59,368
Happy birthday!

278
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:02,788
Oh, my God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

279
00:22:02,997 --> 00:22:05,708
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

280
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:09,545
Wait a minute. You making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

281
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:13,632
Okay. Well, let's see.
The economy's in the toilet.

282
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:17,052
China's undercutting us at every turn.
I'm at a loss.

283
00:22:19,346 --> 00:22:21,891
- Wait. Skyler?
- Yes?

284
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,684
I wanna hear it first.

285
00:22:24,602 --> 00:22:26,145
Absolutely not. No way.

286
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:28,606
You cannot deny your employer
his birthday wish.

287
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,567
- Yes, I can. Watch me.
- Please!

288
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:35,571
If this is your birthday wish,
I feel very, very sorry for you.

289
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,241
- Come on. It was so good last time.
- It was ages ago.

290
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,328
And I'm enormous now.

291
00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:44,747
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

292
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:47,249
Not that I ever did. I mean, come on.

293
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,877
These candles are getting wax
all over the place.

294
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:51,837
- Seriously.
- Yes, come on, Skyler.

295
00:22:52,046 --> 00:22:56,759
<i>- Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...
- It's obscene.</i>

296
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:59,929
<i>Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...</i>

297
00:23:10,231 --> 00:23:15,611
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

298
00:23:16,987 --> 00:23:22,451
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

299
00:23:23,994 --> 00:23:30,209
<i>Happy birthday, Mr. President</i>

300
00:23:30,418 --> 00:23:34,713
<i>Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated</i>

301
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,301
<i>Happy birthday</i>

302
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:43,973
<i>To you</i>

303
00:23:47,977 --> 00:23:49,645
That was fantastic.

304
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:51,689
Isn't she great, huh?

305
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,275
Okay, here we go.

306
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:08,998
<i>- He wasn't there.
- Oh, he was there, all right.</i>

307
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:11,751
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours.

308
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,085
Nobody came.

309
00:24:13,294 --> 00:24:15,921
<i>All I know is my contact
said he was there.</i>

310
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,382
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

311
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,426
<i>Yes, I'm positive.</i>

312
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:22,136
<i>- Where was he?
- Who knows?</i>

313
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:25,014
Maybe he checked you out
with a telephoto lens...

314
00:24:25,222 --> 00:24:27,016
...didn't like the cut of your jib.

315
00:24:27,224 --> 00:24:31,604
Anyway, it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no-go.

316
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,273
What? What do you mean?

317
00:24:34,482 --> 00:24:35,858
No deal. No dice.

318
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:38,027
Shot at and missed. Shit on and hit.

319
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:39,487
Wait a minute.

320
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:42,198
How can he make that decision
without even meeting me?

321
00:24:42,406 --> 00:24:45,534
<i>I told you, he's very cautious
who he does business with, all right?</i>

322
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:50,206
He's skittish, like a deer.

323
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,459
Call him back.

324
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:55,711
<i>I'm sorry. I can't do that.</i>

325
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,547
Yes, you can. Call him, Saul.

326
00:24:58,756 --> 00:25:01,008
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

327
00:25:01,217 --> 00:25:03,469
I called a guy who called a guy
who called a guy.

328
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:05,346
Second of all, it's over.

329
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:08,015
<i>Understand?
With this particular individual...</i>

330
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:10,601
<i>...all you get is the one shot.</i>

331
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:13,062
Look...

332
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,898
...I'll see if I can scrape
something else together...

333
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:17,858
...but don't get your hopes up.

334
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:20,820
<i>No one else handles
that kind of bulk.</i>

335
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:22,571
Damn it.

336
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:06,092
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

337
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:15,184
Can I help you, sir?

338
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:19,313
Diet Coke, please.

339
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:24,276
And five minutes of your time.

340
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:37,540
- What can I do for you?
- Have a seat.

341
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:40,876
Please.

342
00:27:52,388 --> 00:27:56,600
I would like to know why you wouldn't
meet with me yesterday.

343
00:27:57,977 --> 00:28:00,688
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

344
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,443
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

345
00:28:06,193 --> 00:28:08,654
I believe that person was you.

346
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:12,408
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

347
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:15,161
I don't think I am.

348
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,125
Sir, if you have a complaint...

349
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,586
...I suggest you submit it
through our e-mail system.

350
00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:26,255
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

351
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:30,718
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with...

352
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:33,220
...is very careful.

353
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:35,431
A cautious man.

354
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:39,143
I believe we're alike in that way.

355
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:44,899
If you are who I think you are...

356
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:47,526
...you should give me another chance.

357
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:55,451
I don't think we're alike at all,
Mr. White.

358
00:28:57,286 --> 00:29:00,081
You are not a cautious man at all.

359
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:03,292
Your partner was late
and he was high.

360
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,213
Yes. Yes, he was.

361
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:11,217
He's high often, isn't he?

362
00:29:14,804 --> 00:29:16,597
You have poor judgment.

363
00:29:18,015 --> 00:29:20,059
I can't work with someone
with poor judgment.

364
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:23,395
Are you familiar with my product?

365
00:29:24,021 --> 00:29:27,608
- I've been told it's excellent.
- It is impeccable.

366
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:30,277
It is the purest...

367
00:29:30,486 --> 00:29:33,948
...most chemically sound product
on the market anywhere.

368
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:36,492
That is not the only factor.

369
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,663
You could charge twice the current rate
for what I provide...

370
00:29:40,871 --> 00:29:43,332
...and your customers would pay it.

371
00:29:43,874 --> 00:29:45,626
Hands down.

372
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:52,800
Now, who I choose to do business with
on my end is not your problem.

373
00:29:53,717 --> 00:29:55,010
You won't see him.

374
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:57,972
You won't interact with him.

375
00:29:58,556 --> 00:30:00,182
Forget he exists.

376
00:30:01,642 --> 00:30:04,019
I have to ask.

377
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:06,856
Why?

378
00:30:07,064 --> 00:30:08,858
Why him?

379
00:30:11,235 --> 00:30:14,071
Because he does what I say.

380
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:17,950
Because I can trust him.

381
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,704
How much product
do you have on hand?

382
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:24,373
Thirty-eight pounds.

383
00:30:24,582 --> 00:30:27,209
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

384
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:35,301
Will I hear from you?

385
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,346
I have your numbers.

386
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:47,521
You can never trust a drug addict.

387
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,247
Look, I mean, it's all kind of
little dribs and drabs...

388
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:08,626
...but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

389
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:12,379
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

390
00:31:12,588 --> 00:31:14,131
Dribs and drabs.

391
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,425
Once you add it all up, though,
with Keller...

392
00:31:16,634 --> 00:31:20,096
...the revenues are almost 10 percent
less than was actually received.

393
00:31:20,304 --> 00:31:25,392
And this is every quarter
for the last two years.

394
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:32,066
When I saw that, I got worried
so I checked Accounts Receivable.

395
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:35,277
I found six other instances...

396
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:38,989
...of revenues being under-reported.

397
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,701
And I've only just started
to look into it.

398
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,288
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

399
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:48,749
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

400
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,835
Most of the time, they overestimate.

401
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:53,462
I let them roll their overages
into the next order...

402
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:55,798
...and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.

403
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:57,633
Obviously, we forgot...

404
00:31:57,842 --> 00:32:01,846
...or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

405
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:05,307
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see...

406
00:32:05,516 --> 00:32:09,145
...the money's coming in eventually,
as you can see.

407
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:11,605
Right.

408
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:13,399
Right...

409
00:32:13,607 --> 00:32:18,237
...but I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage...

410
00:32:18,446 --> 00:32:20,823
...to try and sort this out.

411
00:32:21,949 --> 00:32:25,995
Most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

412
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:29,498
In a few cases...

413
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:34,170
...I found xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

414
00:32:37,214 --> 00:32:38,924
Ted.

415
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,728
All right.

416
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,106
You got me.

417
00:32:54,648 --> 00:32:59,528
We're talking nearly a million dollars
of undocumented revenue.

418
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:03,115
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking...

419
00:33:03,324 --> 00:33:05,493
...about saving a company.

420
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:07,495
I'm thinking about people's jobs...

421
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:09,497
...about their mortgages
and pensions...

422
00:33:09,705 --> 00:33:13,000
...and their college funds
for their kids.

423
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:15,044
Not to mention my own.

424
00:33:15,252 --> 00:33:17,838
It doesn't mean that you have to
break the law.

425
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:19,715
Yes, it does, Skyler.

426
00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:21,842
It's in the books.
Business is terrible.

427
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:25,346
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

428
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:27,014
- If I don't keep up--
- Ted.

429
00:33:27,223 --> 00:33:30,059
People go to prison for this.

430
00:33:36,065 --> 00:33:39,151
My dad built this company
from nothing.

431
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:42,488
We make things here.

432
00:33:42,696 --> 00:33:45,741
The people who work here
are like family.

433
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:50,037
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

434
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:55,709
Sky...

435
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,506
...don't report this.

436
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:03,092
Please.

437
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,972
I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.

438
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,271
But I can't be a part of it.

439
00:34:18,315 --> 00:34:19,817
I know.

440
00:34:20,443 --> 00:34:22,695
I know. I just wish...

441
00:34:23,821 --> 00:34:25,531
I'm sorry.

442
00:34:27,658 --> 00:34:29,493
I don't want you to go.

443
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,306
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

444
00:34:50,514 --> 00:34:53,267
<i>Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
Just checking in with you, man.</i>

445
00:34:53,476 --> 00:34:55,311
<i>We missed you at the funeral today.</i>

446
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,979
<i>The whole crew was representing.</i>

447
00:34:57,188 --> 00:34:59,148
<i>Even Badger came
all the way from Fresno.</i>

448
00:34:59,356 --> 00:35:01,442
<i>Combo's people, his ma,
grandma, cousins...</i>

449
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,611
<i>...everyone was all choked up
and shit.</i>

450
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:06,489
<i>Man, it was, like, emotional.</i>

451
00:35:06,697 --> 00:35:08,657
<i>And you should have
seen the coffin.</i>

452
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:10,743
<i>It was this shiny white pearlescent.</i>

453
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:14,038
<i>I'm sure I've seen
the exact same paint job on a Lexus.</i>

454
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:17,208
<i>So we're definitely talking high-end.</i>

455
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,628
<i>Anyway, guess you had something
bigger going down.</i>

456
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:23,923
<i>Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.</i>

457
00:36:06,424 --> 00:36:08,384
I like to mix some ice with it.

458
00:36:56,932 --> 00:36:58,601
Hold that.

459
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:02,438
What's it feel like?

460
00:37:06,108 --> 00:37:07,902
There's a chill.

461
00:37:09,111 --> 00:37:11,363
Don't freak out. It passes.

462
00:37:11,822 --> 00:37:13,115
And then...

463
00:37:13,324 --> 00:37:14,450
You'll see.

464
00:37:19,205 --> 00:37:20,873
I'll meet you there.

465
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:34,261
Take that off.

466
00:40:03,786 --> 00:40:06,247
Phones off, please.

467
00:40:24,348 --> 00:40:26,392
Pipes, I guess.

468
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,395
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

469
00:40:29,979 --> 00:40:32,064
Eyes on your paper.

470
00:40:47,163 --> 00:40:48,497
Yes.

471
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:04,388
Excuse me, where's the manager?

472
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:06,891
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

473
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:10,519
No, no, no.
I met a man here last week.

474
00:41:10,728 --> 00:41:13,606
He's a black gentleman.
He's thin. Glasses.

475
00:41:13,814 --> 00:41:15,357
Yes, sir. That's the owner.

476
00:41:15,566 --> 00:41:17,401
Oh, owner. Okay.

477
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,362
He owns 14 Los Polios restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

478
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:22,865
He could be at any one of them.

479
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:27,620
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...?

480
00:41:27,828 --> 00:41:30,539
I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out.

481
00:41:30,748 --> 00:41:33,834
Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy
to refer you to our website.

482
00:41:34,043 --> 00:41:35,878
No, no.

483
00:41:36,087 --> 00:41:38,047
- What's his name?
- Gustavo.

484
00:41:38,255 --> 00:41:39,757
Gus.

485
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:40,966
Thank you.

486
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:47,681
Thirty-eight pounds, $1.2 million.

487
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:51,352
Truck stop,
two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.

488
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,895
- One hour.
- What?

489
00:41:53,104 --> 00:41:54,480
One hour. You in or out?

490
00:41:55,106 --> 00:41:58,275
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

491
00:41:58,484 --> 00:42:00,486
One hour. If you miss it...

492
00:42:00,694 --> 00:42:03,405
...don't ever show your face
in here again.

493
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:12,248
Exit 13 off the 25 South,
to a truck...

494
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:15,584
<i>- Come on! Come on!
- Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

495
00:42:15,793 --> 00:42:18,587
Jesse. Jesse, pick up the phone.

496
00:42:18,796 --> 00:42:20,631
Pick up the phone.

497
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:24,176
I'm coming by. I need the product.

498
00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:26,178
I need the product now.

499
00:43:13,601 --> 00:43:16,061
Oh, God.

500
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,991
Jesse.

501
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:34,038
Jesse!

502
00:43:34,663 --> 00:43:36,290
Jesse.

503
00:43:37,124 --> 00:43:38,834
Jesse.

504
00:43:58,729 --> 00:44:01,440
Jesse. Jesse.

505
00:44:02,608 --> 00:44:04,401
Jesse.

506
00:44:26,215 --> 00:44:28,384
Jesse.

507
00:44:28,592 --> 00:44:30,177
Jesse. Jesse, wake up.

508
00:44:30,386 --> 00:44:32,054
Jesse.

509
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:35,391
Jesse. Jesse, wake up. Wake up.

510
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,725
Wake up!

511
00:44:36,934 --> 00:44:38,519
Come on, damn it.

512
00:44:38,727 --> 00:44:40,020
Wake up.

513
00:44:41,397 --> 00:44:42,398
Where'd you put it?

514
00:44:42,606 --> 00:44:44,358
- Where's the product?
- Get off of me.

515
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:47,445
Where is it?
Where'd you hide the meth?

516
00:44:47,653 --> 00:44:49,405
- In the kitchen.
- Where?

517
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:52,241
Under the sink.

518
00:45:54,678 --> 00:45:59,642
No. No, no, no.
Not now, not now. Not now!
