1
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,386
- Hey, Donna.
- Hi.

2
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,930
- James, come on in.
- Hi.

3
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,391
We just came
to say goodbye to Maddy.

4
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,935
Oh, I'm sorry, you just missed her.

5
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,689
In fact, I dropped her off
at the bus station not 20 minutes ago.

6
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,441
- She's gone?
- Yes.

7
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,652
She thought that you were coming
over last night.

8
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,615
Um, did she say anything?

9
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,327
Well, I would have to say that
she was a little bit disappointed.

10
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,163
Leland?

11
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,373
Leland, honey?

12
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,042
Excuse me.

13
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,685
You know, if you'd like,
you could write her.

14
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,230
I'm sure she'd be glad
to hear from you.

15
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,149
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry
we bothered you.

16
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,276
Hey, no bother, no bother.

17
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,528
- Say hi to your folks for me, Donna.
- Okay.

18
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,113
- Okay.
- Goodbye, Mr. Palmer.

19
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,282
Bye, James.

20
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,661
- Take it easy now.
- All right.

21
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,675
- Leland?
- Yes, dear.

22
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:23,595
Remember to sign us up for
the Glenn Miller Night at the club.

23
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,181
Don't worry, dear, I won't forget.

24
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,295
- Bye, hon.
- Bye, Leland.

25
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,633
It smells like a toilet in here.
There's nothing...

26
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,015
Jerry, what the hell
took you so long?

27
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:56,229
Ah, gee, datelines, time zones,
I don't even know where I am.

28
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,650
God, you look terrible.

29
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,201
- Jerry.
- Ben.

30
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,624
Well, Ben,
since your regular mouthpiece

31
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,460
has been charged
with murder himself,

32
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:23,215
I'm gonna be handling your case
personally. So let's get started.

33
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,802
Did you kill her?

34
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:31,681
- Jerry, for God's sakes.
- Sorry, you're right.

35
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,852
The last thing a good defense attorney
needs to know is the truth.

36
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,650
Jerry, can you get me out of here?

37
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,237
Well, they can only hold you
for 24 hours without charging you.

38
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,530
Or is it 48?

39
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,619
Oh, Jerry, Jerry,
I am in trouble here.

40
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,539
Under control, big brother.

41
00:06:55,748 --> 00:07:00,335
Okay, so where are we saying
you were on the night Laura died?

42
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,966
- I was with Catherine.
- That's not a good choice.

43
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,385
It happens to be the truth.

44
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,512
Oh, dear.

45
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,684
Is there any sign of her?
Bone... Bone fragments or teeth?

46
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:21,022
Charred corroborating note
regarding your whereabouts?

47
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,239
I'm so depressed.

48
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,253
Bunk beds.

49
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,843
Do you remember
our first room, Ben?

50
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:54,264
Me on the top bunk
and you on the bottom bunk.

51
00:07:54,724 --> 00:08:00,312
And Louise Dombrowski dancing
on the hook rug with a flashlight.

52
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,932
Lord, what's become of us?

53
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,147
You know, the first time I went in,

54
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:30,068
they thought it was my bladder,
so they checked it again.

55
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:34,239
It was an infection.
I hadn't even been near a rusty nail.

56
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,200
I mean, you remember that time
my toe turned purple, right?

57
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:41,079
So instead, I took a bath in baking
soda and then my toe came around,

58
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,581
but I got the worst cramps

59
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,791
like I swallowed
a kinked hose or something.

60
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,293
Have you seen Andy?

61
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,087
Oh, you must be that native person

62
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,008
I've heard so much about,
um, Eagle Eye?

63
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,136
Hawk. Sister?

64
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,722
Oh, yeah, this is my sister Gwen.
This is Hawk.

65
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,974
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.

66
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:05,478
God, how you must hate us white
people after all we've done to you.

67
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,896
Some of my best friends

68
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,648
- are white people.
- Oh.

69
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:14,279
Anyway, oh, come on.
My stomach...

70
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,657
Diane, 10:03 a.m.,
Great Northern Hotel.

71
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,869
Sheriff Truman and I have just been
with the one-armed man,

72
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,787
or what's left of him.

73
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,581
In another time, another culture,

74
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,334
he may have been
a seer, a shaman priest.

75
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,920
In our world, he's a shoe salesman
and lives among the shadows.

76
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,688
Leland Palmer.

77
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,279
- Whoops! Excuse me.
- Whoa!

78
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,076
Does he know
we arrested Ben Horne?

79
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,620
Doesn't look like it.

80
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,623
Harry, best if he'd hear it from you.

81
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:19,094
Hi, Harry, Agent Cooper. Heh.
Just having a little fun.

82
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,513
You're looking good, Leland.

83
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,641
Just call me Fred. Ha-ha-ha.

84
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,187
Leland, I'm sorry.

85
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,440
We didn't want you
to hear it from anyone else.

86
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,694
We've arrested Ben Horne
for Laura's murder.

87
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,570
- Huh?
- He hasn't been charged,

88
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,531
but we're holding him.

89
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,034
- Ben? Ha, ha.
- That's right.

90
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,745
There must be
some mistake, Harry.

91
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,622
Ben?

92
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,876
- I thought that Jacques Renault had...
- No.

93
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,630
Ben.

94
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,717
- You have a strong case against him?
- Yes, we do.

95
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,885
Oh, God.

96
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,722
- Will you be all right, Leland?
- Oh.

97
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,976
Yeah.

98
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,731
- The law will handle this.
- As it should be.

99
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:18,194
Thanks, Harry. Agent Cooper.

100
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,682
Harry, I'll catch up with you.

101
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,704
Leland?

102
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,956
Ahem. Yes.

103
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,836
If you can remember anything unusual
about Mr. Horne's behavior

104
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,089
the night of Laura's death,
would you please let me know?

105
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,301
I will, of course.

106
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,180
Thank you.

107
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,365
Everything okay?

108
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,367
I'm not sure.

109
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,611
This won't hurt a bit.

110
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:28,449
Sheriff, I protest this brutal treatment
of my client.

111
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,202
After all this man
has done for this town...

112
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,288
- Now, hold still.
- Ow!

113
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,048
I'll have the results
in a couple of hours.

114
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,342
- Thanks, doc.
- Gentlemen,

115
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,096
I demand that my client
either be released or charged.

116
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,933
Never in all my years of practicing law
have I witnessed such a complete

117
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:59,063
and utter disregard for
an accused man's constitutional rights.

118
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:03,026
Jeremy Horne,
Gonzaga University, 1974.

119
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,321
Graduated last in his class of 142.

120
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,448
Passed the bar on his third attempt.

121
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,742
License to practice
revoked in the states

122
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,786
of Illinois, Florida,
Alaska, Massachusetts.

123
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,707
Hey, I'm not on trial here.

124
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,417
Sit down.

125
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,047
Mr. Horne, do you know what this is?

126
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,550
- A book.
- A book.

127
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,636
Take a closer look.

128
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,604
A diary.

129
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,273
We all know about One-Eyed Jack's.

130
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,901
So did Laura.

131
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,990
"Someday, I'm gonna tell the world
all about Ben Horne.

132
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,743
I'm gonna tell them who he really is."

133
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,122
She never got the chance, did she?

134
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:07,590
Come on, Ben, we're all adults here.

135
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:13,471
Wild, young girl like Laura Palmer,
things spin out of control.

136
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:18,601
She becomes a threat not just to you,
but to your business, your family.

137
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,437
You are way out of line.

138
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,399
Well, maybe
you don't have anything to hide.

139
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,819
That's not what it says in here.

140
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,279
- You cannot talk to me like this!
- Ben. Ben.

141
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,448
- You cannot, you understand?
- Sit down.

142
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,661
Nice and easy. Gentlemen, I'd like
a moment alone with my brother...

143
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,496
With my client.

144
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,791
If you don't mind?

145
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,960
You have your moment.

146
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,885
Ben, Ben.

147
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,388
Ben, if you're gonna blurt out
a confession like that,

148
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,182
it's gonna make our options
shrink down to a tiny little nub.

149
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,019
All right, what are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

150
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,313
Your alibi has been roasted.

151
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,816
They can establish motive.

152
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,737
And your blood
may have Laura's fingerprints on it.

153
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:19,120
Ben, as your attorney,

154
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,832
your friend, and your brother,

155
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,297
I strongly suggest
that you get yourself a better lawyer.

156
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,929
Okay, one last chance, Leo.

157
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,057
Don't disappoint me.

158
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,850
The mill?

159
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:52,820
Okay, one last chance,
Leo. Don't disappoint me.

160
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,572
The mill?

161
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,157
Keep it simple.

162
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,160
Insurance investigators
should read "arson."

163
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,080
Block letters about, uh, 6 feet high.

164
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,499
The deal as we discussed?

165
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,756
Ben Horne, his voice,

166
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:16,177
and Johnson's voice, Ben and Leo.

167
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,643
Special delivery for Mr. Horne.

168
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,108
Bobby. Oh, God.

169
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,819
Bobby!

170
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,867
He did it again.

171
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,329
It's your turn to clean him this time.

172
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,462
What's that?

173
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,383
That is our ship.

174
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,135
What's that mean?

175
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:02,431
Since our cash cow in the other room
has turned into a sinkhole,

176
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,686
I've decided to pursue a career
in business.

177
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,938
Really? Like a salesman?

178
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,985
Oh, no, I'm thinking
more executive suite.

179
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,653
- Really?
- Yeah.

180
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,406
Bobby, that sounds great.

181
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:23,536
I'm gonna give you
anything you want.

182
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:28,291
Um, I want a full-time nanny.

183
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,715
- Maybe a French maid.
- Bobby.

184
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,437
- Hello, Norma.
- Mother.

185
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,273
I trust those are real potatoes
and not flakes?

186
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,192
Real potatoes.

187
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,986
Excuse me.

188
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,824
What a nice surprise to see you here.

189
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,576
Mm! Hey, those are good.

190
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,454
I see they taught
him a skill in the stockade.

191
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:10,082
- Where is your charming husband?
- Hank? He's not here right now.

192
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,043
I see.

193
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,005
Mother, I got your message.
But if you don't mind my asking,

194
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,257
what are you doing here?

195
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,552
I want to introduce you
to my new husband.

196
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,222
Husband?

197
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,391
Ernie, this is Norma.

198
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,102
Hi, how are you?

199
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,897
- We're honeymooning. Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

200
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,817
I wonder if I could
bother you for a cup of coffee?

201
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,657
- Nice girl.
- She's darling.

202
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,493
Ernie's a financial analyst.

203
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,663
I just love what you've done
with your diner, darling.

204
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,249
The flowers add
such a measure of cheer.

205
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,919
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

206
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,090
Nice to see those good looks haven't
isolated themselves to one generation.

207
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,470
- Yeah, I know, go with gold figures.
- Excuse me.

208
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,766
You still look very smart
in that uniform.

209
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,019
Your figure's lovely.
It hasn't changed.

210
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,773
Now, I don't mean to be rude,
but how long will you be staying?

211
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,319
A couple of days. Ernie wanted
to see something of the country.

212
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,988
Why?

213
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,366
I just wish I had known, that's all.

214
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,702
Oh, I didn't mean for you
to go into any fuss.

215
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,246
You know me, dear, I'm easy.

216
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,123
What's wrong?

217
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,167
Nothing, it's just that
there's a food critic coming

218
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,586
and I'm short on help, that's all.

219
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,548
Food critic. Ooh.

220
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,093
So that's why you tried so hard
to make the place look nice.

221
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:48,681
Norma, hoping to spend
much more time with you.

222
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,766
If it's all right, we'd better check in.

223
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,020
I've got a Tokyo fax
waiting for me at the desk.

224
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,314
We'll be at the Great Northern.

225
00:21:56,523 --> 00:22:00,234
I'm sorry we missed Henry.
I'll call you later, okay?

226
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,779
Okay. Nice to meet you.

227
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,558
He's close.

228
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,521
Nurse.

229
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,648
Could I have
a glass of water, please?

230
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,484
Yes, sir.

231
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,588
I'm sorry.

232
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,026
Hi, Norma.

233
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,405
I guess I'm a little late.

234
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,950
Forty-eight hours is not late, Hank,
it's missing.

235
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,662
I'm sorry, it was some, uh...
Some business I had to take care of.

236
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,997
Business? No, this is business.

237
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,793
Business is a place where you come to
whether you feel like it or not.

238
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,129
- Norma, I...
- Don't sweet-talk me,

239
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,965
I'm this far from telling you
to take a hike.

240
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,510
Norma, please don't make that
kind of judgment until you hear me out.

241
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,763
Because of the bad choices
I've made,

242
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,599
there are people out there,

243
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,980
people from my past
who wanna see me fail.

244
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:04,567
I've tried fighting them,
but I just get in more trouble.

245
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:09,155
I've tried running from them,
but there's always somebody faster.

246
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,159
I know it's no way for a man
to live his life,

247
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,495
but sometimes it's just best

248
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:21,125
to hold up and wait
for the storm to pass.

249
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,337
I didn't mean to hurt you.

250
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,593
I'm just trying to keep my head
above water.

251
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,933
Maybe next time,
you'll ask for a little help.

252
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,689
Next time, I will.

253
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:47,109
Well, the prodigal son returns.

254
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,779
- Heh, Vivian.
- Hi.

255
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,034
- You look great.
- Thanks. Ha, ha.

256
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,453
Prison treat you well?

257
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:01,373
Well, uh, ahem, that's a long story.

258
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,668
I'd like to hear it over dinner tonight.
I have a new husband.

259
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,464
- Heh. Great Northern, 8:30?
- We'd love to.

260
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,967
- I don't think if I'll be able to get there.
- We'll be fine, honey.

261
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,886
Eight-thirty sharp, we'll be there.

262
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,021
- Harry?
- Oh, hello, Pete.

263
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,023
What you got?

264
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,692
Woodpecker.

265
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,779
Pileated, I think.

266
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,575
Yeah. Here.

267
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,915
Pileated woodpecker.

268
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,210
Outstanding.

269
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,463
Harry?

270
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,840
Yeah, Pete.

271
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,387
Harry, Josie's gone.

272
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,598
Yeah, I know.

273
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,934
When I came home
from the late shift,

274
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:07,606
she left a note on the kitchen table,
no explanations, no goodbyes.

275
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,483
A note.

276
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,820
She sold the mill to Ben Horne.

277
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,323
Well, not exactly.

278
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,867
You don't have to explain.

279
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,374
I loved her.

280
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,129
There. I said it.

281
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,215
- No offense, Harry.
- Eh.

282
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,135
I loved her too.

283
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,973
I stood there and watched her go.
Watched her assistant

284
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,433
carry her bags away.

285
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,435
Her assistant?

286
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,895
Yeah, Asian fellow.
Never saw him before.

287
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,648
What did he look like?

288
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,694
Average height,
medium build, ponytail.

289
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,280
Oh, that was her cousin, Jonathan.

290
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,743
She said it was her assistant,
Mr. Lee.

291
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,371
Mr. Lee?

292
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:12,171
Harry, I have a bad feeling.

293
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:17,051
- I'm right there with you, Pete.
- Harry.

294
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,679
Hello, Pete. Gerard's missing.
He knocked the deputy out.

295
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,390
Pete, you'll have to excuse us.

296
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,024
He don't get far.

297
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,821
Hi, sheriff. Agent Cooper.

298
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,496
Lucy?

299
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,804
- Lucy?
- What?

300
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,854
Andy?

301
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,206
Step right in, Pete.

302
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,376
We desperate criminals
are locked safely in our cages.

303
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,795
I have a message for you.

304
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:39,049
Greetings from the boys
down at the mill?

305
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,517
Ah. But first, a little music.

306
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,563
Hello, Benjamin.

307
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,526
Oh, I'm sorry I haven't
dropped by for a visit, dear.

308
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,280
But I have a strong aversion
to prisons.

309
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,199
- How awful...
- She's alive?

310
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:10,956
The night
we spent together lost in love.

311
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:15,043
When was that?
It seems so long ago.

312
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,629
Almost like a dream.

313
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:23,093
Oh, yes, I remember,
it was the night Laura Palmer died.

314
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,973
Memory is so unreliable finally,
maybe it was a dream.

315
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,559
Maybe it never happened.

316
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:34,688
To tell you the truth,
I can't be sure anymore.

317
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,734
What does she want? I'll pay anything.
What does she want?

318
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,778
You okay there, Benji?

319
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,655
In exchange for my testimony, dear,

320
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,910
you will sign the mill and
Ghostwood Estates back over to me.

321
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,289
I will consider letting you keep
your precious hotel.

322
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,293
A representative of mine
will come to you

323
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,755
with the documents within 24 hours.

324
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,674
If you won't cooperate...

325
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,427
Well, I'm confident
that you'll go on from here

326
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:09,056
to excel in one or another
of the many fine career opportunities

327
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,308
offered by the federal
prison system.

328
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,271
Ben, so nice to see you again.

329
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,360
She set me up.

330
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,404
That Catherine.

331
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,619
She set me up.

332
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,957
She's a cautioned, isn't she?

333
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:57,771
You set me up!
You bitch! You bitch!

334
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,566
I'll get you, you bitch.

335
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:23,505
Set me up.

336
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,050
Chicks and ducks and geese

337
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,385
Better scurry

338
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,930
When I take you out in the surrey

339
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:38,228
When I take you out in the surrey
With the fringe on top

340
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:54,745
When I take you out in the surrey

341
00:31:56,414 --> 00:32:00,459
With the fringe on top

342
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:05,005
Harry, are driver education programs
mandatory in your school system?

343
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,132
Yep.

344
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,510
I think we got a dropout.
Harry, look out.

345
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,271
Uh-oh.

346
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:36,119
With the fringe on top

347
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,837
- Leland.
- Ah. Heh.

348
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,216
Agent Cooper, Harry, I'm sorry.

349
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,386
- Are you two all right?
- Leland, we're fine. How about you?

350
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,721
Oh, sure, I'm fine, I'm fine.

351
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,517
I was just on my way to the club
to try out a new set of irons,

352
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:03,063
and, uh, I must have started
thinking about Ben.

353
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,148
I guess my mind just wandered.

354
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,485
It's a good idea to leave your troubles
at home when operating a vehicle.

355
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,530
You're right, of course.
My apologies.

356
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,075
Ah! I did remember something,

357
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:19,579
as you asked,
about the night Laura died.

358
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,291
I was working late at the office
with Ben, it was about 10:00.

359
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,252
He left the room
to make a phone call.

360
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:30,340
I don't know who he was talking to, but
his voice was raised, he was angry.

361
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,468
I heard him mention
something about

362
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,095
a dairy.

363
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,849
- A dairy?
- That's what I think, yes.

364
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,143
- A diary.
- That could be it.

365
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,520
Sheriff Truman, this is Lucy.

366
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,940
Are you there, sheriff?
I have an urgent message from Hawk.

367
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,778
- Do you play golf, Agent Cooper?
- Uh, yes, Leland, I enjoy its precision.

368
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,406
I'd like to invite you for a round
at the club someday.

369
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:58,285
May I show you my new clubs?

370
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,371
Uh, sure.

371
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,794
Cooper.

372
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,089
They found Gerard.
Near the waterfall.

373
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,217
Better go. They're waiting for us.

374
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,388
Let's go get him. Leland,
we'll see those clubs another time.

375
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,932
I understand, Agent Cooper.
You let me know

376
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,311
- if there's anything I can do to help.
- Will do.

377
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,016
Poor Andy.

378
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,644
You know, the exact
same thing happened to me

379
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,270
when I first got pregnant.

380
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,814
I would be out shopping,

381
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,691
and then boom, pass right out
in the produce section.

382
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:15,445
Then come to covered in bruises
and crushed fruit,

383
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:19,825
and strangers standing over me
waiting to see if I was dead.

384
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,829
You see, people want terrible things
to happen to you, I know.

385
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,835
I wanna talk to you
about my sperms.

386
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,255
Sperms?
You know, that is all men think about.

387
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,091
You know, I remember
when little Carl was first born

388
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,968
and they laid him out on my breast,

389
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,888
I looked down and saw what kind of
a tiny little creature I was dealing with.

390
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:48,520
And I thought to myself, I thought,
"My God, just what the world needs,

391
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:54,276
another sperm gun running around
loose. Right? Women beware."

392
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,029
Well, I did.

393
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:06,204
I had mine counted twice.
The first time, they were all dead.

394
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:11,543
Oh, man, if I had a nickel
every time I heard that one.

395
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,838
- Second time, they were jumping like...
- What? What?

396
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,048
- Like salmon swimming upstream.

397
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:21,344
So, of course, all you could
think of was spawning. Ha, ha.

398
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,223
- Shut up.
- Shut up, Gwen.

399
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:37,152
So when you told me that you were
pregnant, I didn't think it could be me

400
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:41,364
because mine were all dead
supposedly at the time.

401
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,325
Uh-huh.

402
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:47,996
But they got better.
I was misinformed. I'm the father.

403
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,918
Oh, brother.

404
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,921
Aren't I?

405
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,966
Oh, yeah. Oh, come here.

406
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:04,054
You want to see
your mean Aunt Lucy.

407
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:10,977
Oh, aren't you neat,
you little snooky-bookems.

408
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,240
Oh.

409
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,825
He's been close.

410
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,205
Bob is not here now.

411
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,583
Sheriff. Sheriff?

412
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:37,420
Isn't there something
that you'd like to share with us?

413
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,507
Oh, great.

414
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:44,427
And would you tell this guy to stop
staring at me like I'm a dog biscuit.

415
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,181
Bob has been very close.

416
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,684
Who's Bob? I don't know a Bob.

417
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,310
Do we know a Bob?

418
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,565
Sheriff, no offense, but clearly,
this man's stairs do not reach the attic.

419
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,651
Now, your 24 hours are up.

420
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,487
You either charge my client
or let him go!

421
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:10,829
Ben Horne, I'm charging you
with the murder of Laura Palmer.

422
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,749
Yeah. Good move, Jer.

423
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,336
Hawk, take Mr. Gerard
back to the hotel.

424
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,714
- Nail all the windows shut.
- No. No.

425
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:24,384
- I want two men on the door.
- You two-bit lumberjack.

426
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,886
- You're finished in this town.
- Don't make it worse.

427
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,096
You're finished.

428
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,765
Calm down.

429
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,143
- What are you doing?
- Step outside, please?

430
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,895
I'm all right.

431
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:42,110
Harry. Harry, I think we're saddling
the horse before we're ready to ride.

432
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,611
I don't follow.

433
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,072
I don't think Ben Horne
killed Laura Palmer.

434
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,825
- What?
- You should release him.

435
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,452
Cooper?

436
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:54,331
I've backed you every step of the way.
I've had enough of the mumbo jumbo.

437
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:58,084
I've had enough of the dreams,
the visions, the dwarfs, the giants,

438
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,211
Tibet and the rest
of the hocus-pocus.

439
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:03,465
Now, we've got hard evidence
against Ben Horne.

440
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,842
It's my job to lock him up.

441
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,095
You're right, Harry.
This is your back yard.

442
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,890
Sometimes an outsider
can forget that.

443
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,944
Well, the salmon was fresh and firm
and just a little bit overdone.

444
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,864
- Mine too.
- Just right.

445
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,951
Would you excuse me
for a minute, please?

446
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,870
I'll join you.

447
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,998
Ladies, hurry back.

448
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,060
You're not gonna say anything,
are you?

449
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,022
If Vivian ever found out
I'd been inside she'd...

450
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,941
She'd drop me flat.

451
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,984
I like your new hair color.

452
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,072
Ernie Niles.

453
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,616
Ernie "The Professor" Niles.

454
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,412
- So when did you?
- A couple of weeks ago.

455
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,122
Let me tell you, Ernie,

456
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:21,084
without you in there to pal around with
the last six months were sheer hell.

457
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,002
Nobody to go to the library with.

458
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,339
Nobody to stamp out
license plates with.

459
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:31,010
So, uh, what's your angle here
with Miss Moneybags?

460
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,595
No angle.

461
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,806
Come on, buddy,
we don't have any secrets.

462
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,891
Vivian's rolling in dough.

463
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,478
I met Vivian
at a Republican fundraiser.

464
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,398
- We're married.
- Heh.

465
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,651
You must have told her
some tall tale, a whopper.

466
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,863
I'm trying very hard to tell nothing
but the truth these days.

467
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,824
It's, uh, therapeutic.

468
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:58,079
And Vivian wants me to handle
all her investments.

469
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,459
What about yours?
Introduce her to your loan shark?

470
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:06,754
I'm out of it, I'm out of it, Hank.
I don't gamble anymore.

471
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,133
I go to meetings. I go to church too.

472
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,635
So, what happens when
Vivian finds out that you ran off

473
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,556
- with the congregation's picnic fund?
- I never stole from a church.

474
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,225
It was a savings and loan.

475
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,811
I was sick, it was an illness.
I paid my debt.

476
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,190
It's a new life, a clean... Clean slate.

477
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,986
- So she really doesn't know?
- No.

478
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,490
Well, Ernie, this is interesting to me.

479
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,286
Because family is the most
important thing in the world to me.

480
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,916
One must be prepared
to pay any price to protect it.

481
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,751
Don't you agree?

482
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:49,464
Oh, yeah, yeah. I completely agree.

483
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,675
We'll talk more later, Ernie.

484
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,969
I've always enjoyed
our talks in the yard,

485
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,722
man-to-man, prisoner-to-prisoner.

486
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:01,184
- We're back.
- Ladies.

487
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,067
I would like to propose a toast

488
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,570
to the newlyweds
and their happiness.

489
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,989
Thank you, Henry.
It's very generous.

490
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,867
To Ernie and Vivian,

491
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:23,331
to much success in their future
and all their future dealings.

492
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,250
How sweet.

493
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,502
That's sweet.

494
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:02,787
Diane, it's 11:05 p.m. I'm in my room
at the Great Northern Hotel.

495
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,873
There's not a star in the sky tonight.

496
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,376
Ben Horne is in custody.

497
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,920
The trail narrows, Diane.

498
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,213
I'm very close,

499
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,300
but the last few steps are always
the darkest and most difficult.

500
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,779
- Hi.
- Audrey?

501
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,283
- Can I come in and talk?
- All right.

502
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:45,204
- Is that where you got shot?
- Yeah.

503
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,792
Did you arrest him?

504
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,838
Yeah.

505
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,633
Did he do it?

506
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,385
That's for a court to decide.

507
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,304
What do you think?

508
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,932
What I think
doesn't really matter right now.

509
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,727
Did you arrest him
because of what I said?

510
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,354
Only in part.

511
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,773
But it helped?

512
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,900
Yeah.

513
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:19,489
All I ever really wanted
was for him to love me.

514
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,492
I'm sure that he does.

515
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,828
He's ashamed of me.

516
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,497
No, he's not.

517
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,590
Agent Cooper,

518
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:42,887
when I was at One-Eyed Jack's,
I never, never let anyone...

519
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:46,057
Audrey, you don't have
to say anything.

520
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,892
I want you to know.

521
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,852
I know.

522
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,779
I have to get that.

523
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,906
Okay.

524
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,332
Cooper here. Where?

525
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,503
How long ago?

526
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,840
- I'm on my way.
- What's wrong?

527
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,967
I want you to go to your room
and lock the door.

528
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,095
- Why?
- No questions, do what I say.

529
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,097
All right.

530
00:46:14,354 --> 00:47:20,002
It's Maddy Ferguson.
