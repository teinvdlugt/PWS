7
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,135
No, no, no!

8
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,842
Hey.

9
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,601
Uh, it's me.

10
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:52,398
I just wanted to say that
I was thinking about you
and the kids, and, uh...

11
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,610
I love you.

12
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,866
Uh, it's me.

13
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:07,204
I just wanted to say that
I was thinking about you
and the kids, and, uh...

14
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,937
Morning.
Afternoon.

15
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,440
Oh, really? Jesus.

16
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,568
You shouldn't have
let me sleep.

17
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,737
You needed it.

18
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,378
Skyler, I don't entirely remember
what happened last night.

19
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,589
I mean, I might have said
some things that--

20
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,592
Did you know this
Gale Boetticher person?

21
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:07,223
Skyler, I can't even focus on--
Gale Boetticher.

22
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,351
Did you know him?
Heh.

23
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,353
My God. What--?

24
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,523
What exactly
did l say last night?

25
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,650
Just enough.

26
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,903
Did you work together?

27
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,036
Who killed him?

28
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,581
Was it the people you work for?

29
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,793
Definitely not.

30
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,378
Was it somebody who,

31
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:43,843
at some point,
might wanna do the same to you?

32
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:51,225
I seriously doubt it. No.

33
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,731
Ugh. God.

34
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,028
Oh, God.

35
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,245
I think I know what
happened last night, Walt.

36
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,833
Mm. I know exactly
what happened last night.
I drank too much wine.

37
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,378
You told Hank

38
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,174
that the man he was looking for
might still be out there.

39
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:28,012
That it might not be
this Boetticher after all.

40
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,768
And I was up all night,
wondering why you
would say that to him.

41
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,728
Mm. Because l was
drunk, Skyler.

42
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,147
No, but then
I was remembering

43
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,107
your black eye.

44
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:44,153
Your, uh, business disagreement
that you don't wanna talk about.

45
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:48,449
Look, I don't want to talk
about any of this. Ever.

46
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,035
The firewall, all right?

47
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,162
Church and state.

48
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,123
That's how we need
to approach this thing.

49
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,671
And then I remembered the message
you left me the other day,

50
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,217
when you said you loved me.

51
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,264
When I heard that,
I thought that maybe you--

52
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,852
I don't know, that you were regretting
what's happened between us.

53
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,312
And I get that.

54
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,107
After last night, l...

55
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,531
Walt, I think you're scared.

56
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,451
I think that message
was some kind of goodbye.

57
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,370
No, Skyler.

58
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,748
I think last night was a cry for help.
Oh, Jesus.

59
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,333
A cry for help?

60
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,336
I think some part of you
wants Hank to catch you.

61
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:47,049
Wow. That is just...

62
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:52,346
That is it exactly. Yes.

63
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,682
You're like
Dr. Joyce Brothers here.

64
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,933
God.

65
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,893
At least this
would all be over.

66
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:02,523
Yeah, yeah, oh, there's
a tremendous weight
just lifted off of me.

67
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,859
Now l understand myself.

68
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,652
Thank you. Thank you.

69
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,530
Walt, I've said it before.

70
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:13,033
If you are in danger,
we go to the police.

71
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:18,622
I don't wanna hear about the police.
I do not say that lightly.

72
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,916
I know what it could do
to this family.

73
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:26,422
But if it's the only real choice
we have, if it's either that
or you getting shot--

74
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,591
I don't wanna hear
about the police.

75
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:33,012
You're not some hardened criminal,
Walt. You are in over your head.

76
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,472
That's what we'll tell them,
the truth.

77
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,267
That is not the truth.
Of course it is.

78
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,770
A schoolteacher, cancer,
desperate for money.

79
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,149
We're done here.
Roped into working-- Unable to quit.

80
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,401
You told me that
yourself, Walt.

81
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:51,488
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Walt, please.

82
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,451
Let's both of us stop trying
to justify this whole thing

83
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,328
and admit you're in danger.

84
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,416
Who are you talking to right now?

85
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,338
Who is it you think you see?

86
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,800
Do you know
how much l make a year?

87
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,803
I mean, even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe it.

88
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,515
You know what would happen
if l decided to stop going in to work?

89
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:23,020
A business big enough
that it could be listed on
the NASDAQ goes belly up.

90
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,899
Disappears. It ceases
to exist without me. No.

91
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,153
You clearly don't know
who you're talking to,
so let me clue you in.

92
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,324
I am not in danger, Skyler.
I am the danger.

93
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:39,620
A guy opens his door and gets shot,
and you think that of me? No.

94
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,831
I am the one who knocks.

95
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,374
Look, I was...

96
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,057
Skyler?

97
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,999
Here we are, hm?
Just like you left it.

98
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,712
And where is your pretty wife?

99
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,466
She has other
business to attend to.

100
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:22,181
Well, like l say to her,
place sells as is.
Understand?

101
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,933
Yes, l understand.

102
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,144
Good, good.

103
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,897
I don't want her coming back
with more demands.

104
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,649
She gave me hard time
when we settled on price.

105
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,111
We're all on the same page,
Bogdan.

106
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,366
So here is everything
you need.

107
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,410
I keep very good files.
Thank you.

108
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,081
So you are
the boss now, huh?

109
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,669
You think you're ready?

110
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,091
Yes, l think so.

111
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,304
Being boss is tough.

112
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:06,266
I know you think
I was hard on you,

113
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,893
but you'll learn.

114
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,938
Being in charge is not easy.

115
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,023
It takes hard work.

116
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,568
You've seen me work hard, Bogdan.
Yeah?

117
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,821
I don't know.

118
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,948
Not so much, maybe.

119
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,659
But maybe when
you are the boss,

120
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,746
you will just keep
your feet up and relax.

121
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,289
Mm.

122
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,210
The real important thing--

123
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,962
And not everyone
knows this.

124
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,881
--is to be tough.

125
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,262
Boss has to be tough.

126
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,432
Has to say no to people.

127
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:52,980
Has to make cashiers
wipe down cars,

128
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:56,900
even if they don't want to.

129
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:02,030
Can you be tough, Walter?

130
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,036
I am sure you can handle.

131
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:13,292
And if not, you can always
call your wife, no?

132
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,634
Always sticky.
Yeah.

133
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,428
No problem.

134
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,389
As is.

135
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:48,619
Who'd have thought
that someday l would be
handing these keys to you?

136
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,596
Many years. Almost forgot.

137
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,561
Bogdan.

138
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,525

All right.

00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,953
I'm on my way.

162
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,832
You need any help?

00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,002
No.

00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,983
You want me to call her back?

165
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,194
No. No.

166
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:57,284
What exactly did she say?
I mean, exactly.

167
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:03,457
Just, you know, she asked
if l was okay and not to worry.

168
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,292
Like that.

169
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:12,382
Hm. Any rough timetable
on this thing, as to when
she's coming home?

170
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,889
It's about
the gambling, right?

171
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,518
Well, it's kind of hard to--

172
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,771
Dad, she can't understand.

173
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:30,525
It's not like you're doing this
on purpose. You can't help it.

174
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,570
It's not
that simple.

175
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:38,992
Look, you have a disease.
It's like you're an alcoholic, right?

176
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,746
No, it's not. Not at all.
Yes, it is. l read online.

177
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,665
She's not even allowed
to be mad at you.

178
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,585
She can't be mad at you
about the cancer, can she?

179
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,213
Son, these are two
very different things.

180
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,758
Not really.
Gambling addiction is a sickness.

181
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,594
You can't--
Listen, what is going on with me

182
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,430
is not about some disease.
It's about choices.

183
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,140
Choices that I have made.

184
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,018
Choices I stand by.

185
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,947
You're not moving
back in, are you?

186
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,248
No.

187
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:37,175
Hey, you know what?
School can wait.

188
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,847
Why don't we take
a little detour?

189
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,141
What kind of detour?

190
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,019
You'll see.

191
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,735
- Charlie, pick up line three.
- Line three, Charlie.

192
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:03,827
I think it's time
we got you your own car.
What do you think?

193
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,621
What?

194
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:12,085
I think if you're gonna
buy me off,

195
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,921
buy me off.

196
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:20,135
Get an attendant over to the lot.

Amazing. It's amazing.
Yeah. It's good-looking.

204
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,995
That's good.
I'm glad you like it.

205
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,832
I do. Thank you, Dad.
All right. You're welcome.

206
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,767
So you're here.

207
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,436
Yeah.

208
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,775
You're actually here?
To work?

209
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,946
Yeah, man. Jesus.

210
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,530
Jesse.

211
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,283
Come here.

212
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,536
- All right, I need an update.
- Update on what?

213
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,041
An update on these little
field trips that you've
been taking with Mike.

214
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,334
I told you already.

215
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:38,004
We pick up money.
Check on things.
Stuff like that.

216
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:43,969
And you're his bodyguard, right?
What? That's what you said.

217
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,054
I said l guarded him.

218
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,431
Like backup,
like a second set of eyes.

219
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,017
Everybody needs
backup, right?

220
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,269
And this has to be you?

221
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:59,067
It can't be, I don't know,
Tyrus or any of the couple
dozen muscle-heads

222
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,986
that Gus has
working for him?

223
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,279
It has to be Jesse Pinkman.

224
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:07,534
Why? What, is there something
about you that I don't know?

225
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:10,036
Are you a former
Navy SEAL?

226
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,580
Your hands registered
as lethal weapons?

227
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,832
Register this.

228
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,502
All l'm saying is that
do you not even question this?

229
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,006
Do you really believe that you
mean anything to these people?

230
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,259
Not trying to insult.
Just trying to make
you see things.

231
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:28,304
I see they can't outright
kill me, but they don't
want me getting high.

232
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,851
I see this thing probably
started as Gus getting
Mike to babysit me.

233
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,978
But you know what?

234
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:40,025
I saved Mike from getting robbed,
even killed, maybe.

235
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,987
So maybe I'm not
such a loser after all.

236
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,784
I mean, what if it--? Oh, God.

237
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,963
All right. What if it's all just a setup?
What?

238
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:06,384
What if this robbery that
you stopped wasn't even real?

239
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,804
I mean, think about it.
Your first day out guarding Mike.

240
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,390
He steps out for one second
and what happens?

241
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,643
You immediately get robbed.
You are such an asshole.

242
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,271
Keep your friends close,
your enemies closer.

243
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:23,151
Like you said,
Gus can't kill you because of me,
he knows l won't stand for it.

244
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,361
He hates the fact
that he needs me.

245
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,240
What does he do? He goes to work
driving a wedge between you and me.

246
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,118
If you'd been there,
you'd know it wasn't a setup.

247
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,830
Wait a minute. How long
did those guys chase you, huh?

248
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:39,876
Because the way you describe it,
they gave up pretty damn easy.

249
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:45,632
No, no, this whole thing,
all of this...

250
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,594
it's all about me.

251
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,184
Hello?

252
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,689
Uh, look, just hang on.

253
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,736
Yeah?

254
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,114
I'll be right up.

255
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,411
What?
I gotta go.

256
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,290
What? Am I supposed
to clean all this on my own?

257
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,628
Hey.

258
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,050
God--

259
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,569
Ah!

260
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:33,198
Buenos dias, ladies, buenos dias.
Do you speak English?

261
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,618
No.
No, okay. Um...

262
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,830
Ah! Help, help. Uh...

263
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,925
I need help to clean.
Yes.

264
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,149
Yes, muy bueno. It's just this--
No.

265
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,901
No, no, no.

266
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,488
No, no, no.

267
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,247
No, no, ladies.

268
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:39,222
Let me see, let me see.
I tell you what. I tell
you what. Look, look.

269
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,556
Universal language.

270
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,314
This one for you.
Yeah, sí.

271
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,276
Sí, Presidente Grant.
Very important man.

272
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,866
Mas dinero after the--

273
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,079
Are we good?

274
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:07,542
I think we're good.
I think we listened to you.
Please, por favor, por favor.

275
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,588
Please, por favor, por favor.

276
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,173
Ah! Yes.

277
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,210
What's the deal?

278
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:03,843
Well, the deal is,
we're watching that house.

279
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,138
Couple down on the left
with the tree in the front.

280
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,182
Yeah? What for?

281
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,767
A little birdie told me
there's some guys

282
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,188
that have 3 pounds of our product
which they're selling.

283
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,649
And which they sure as hell
didn't get from us.

284
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,695
So, what's the plan?

285
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,323
I just told you.

286
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,242
We sit here and watch that house

287
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,245
until one of our entrepreneurs
pops his head out.

288
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:35,124
Then we ask a few questions
and get our property back.

289
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,212
Why don't you just go
break the door down,

290
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,340
pistol-whip those bitches
and show them who's boss?

291
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:47,053
Because a little birdie
also told me these guys
are into the product

292
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,347
and most likely armed.

293
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:53,059
Now, what you may not
know about meth-heads--

294
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,436
Or maybe you do.

295
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,022
They're kind of
unpredictable.

296
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,235
I don't care for unpredictable.
So we wait.

297
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:08,115
Sorry to burst your bubble, kid,
but that's 90 percent of the job.

298
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:13,287
Don't worry.
I brought sandwiches.

299
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,793
Yes, sir. Heh.

300
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,337
Uh...

301
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,924
Pimento cheese.
How's that sound?

302
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,808
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

303
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,979
You said they're selling right?
Maybe I'm looking to buy.

304
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,071
Who the hell are you?

305
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,615
- Tucker! Tucker!
- I'm here to buy.

306
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,368
- Will you shut the damn door?
- Not my question.

307
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,330
Name's Diesel. Heard you
maybe had some of the blue.

308
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,249
Tucker. Shut the door, Tucker!

309
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,086
- I just-- Just looking for a teenth, yo.
- Tucker! Tucker!

310
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,380
- Come on, help a brother out.
- Tucker!

311
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:08,050
Will you shut the damn door?
We don't sell to strangers.

312
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,553
- Tucker!
- Get off the porch, asshole.

313
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,222
Will you shut the door?
All right already!

314
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,349
Tucker!

315
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,093
Guess we'll go with
Plan A, then.

316
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,904
Pop the trunk, would you?
Why?

317
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:13,324
There's something in there l need.
And what would that be?

318
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,910
I'm getting those pricks
out of that house.

319
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,996
Oh, your first attempt being
such a wild success?

320
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,583
You may know this whole
PI sit-in-the-car business,

321
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,211
but l know meth-heads.

322
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,389
What are you doing?

323
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,599
Digging.

324
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,144
Why?

325
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,522
You know why.

326
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,816
How deep are you going?

327
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,820
I don't know.
How deep do you think it is?

328
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,200
Pretty deep.

329
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:50,337
Hey, uh, you mind taking over
for a minute?

330
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,841
Yeah, sure.

331
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:08,522
Hey, uh, mind if l use your john?
Yeah.

332
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,550
Tucker.

333
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:47,436
Tucker!

334
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,401
Who the hell are you?

335
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,278
I just--
Who the hell are you?

336
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,824
It's cool.
Hey, I'm a friend of Tucker's.

337
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:05,663
What do you want?
I just wanna buy some of the blue.

338
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,623
It's not for sale.

339
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,418
I know you were selling it earlier--

340
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,295
Oh, yeah?
How do you know that?

341
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,631
Uh, Tucker told me.

342
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,884
Yeah, Tucker needs to learn
to keep his damn mouth shut.

343
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,220
Tucker! Tucker!

344
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,350
So, uh, you gonna hook me up?

345
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:30,813
Don't have enough for all
of Tucker's asshole friends. Tucker!

346
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:35,276
You know, I think he's outside.
You wanna just go outside--

347
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,861
Tucker! Tucker!

348
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,698
Hey, hey. Let's go find Tucker.

349
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,616
Okay? Let's go outside.

350
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:47,413
I don't have enough
for you, all right?

351
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:52,668
Yeah. yeah. Yeah, l get it. Okay.

352
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:57,131
I don't wanna start any trouble.
Trouble? What's that mean? Trouble?

353
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:00,384
No, no, no.
I'm just saying we're cool, okay?

354
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,802
We're good.
What?

355
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,305
You can't know that.
What does that mean?

356
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,807
You don't put thoughts
in my head.

357
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,894
You don't put thoughts in my head.
Absolutely. You're right. You're right.

358
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,313
Tucker?

359
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,236
You--

360
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,023
Here you go, Maria.

361
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,733
Veronica.

362
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,151
Ilia, gracias.

363
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,453
I missed that one.
I'm sure it was good.

364
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,050
Wait, where you taking them?

365
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:27,388
Come on, Tyrus, what are you doing?
I'm putting them on a bus.

366
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,557
Why? What bus?
One that takes them back to Honduras.

367
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,268
Hey, wait a second. Wait a minute.

368
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:38,107
Wait, wait. This was my idea.
Don't punish them.

369
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,151
You tell Gus to blame me,
not them.

370
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,654
He does.

The crew that hit our truck
gave away the cargo

381
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,166
to a couple
local nobodies.

382
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,919
Very disciplined of them,
not keeping anything
for themselves.

383
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,881
It was all about
sending a message.

384
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,842
Which they did, literally.

385
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,553
It was written on the bucket lid.

386
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,972
"Ready to talk?"

387
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:55,434
That, I believe,
is the English translation.

388
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,940
I know you're not really asking
for advice.

389
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:07,821
But let me hire 1 0, 1 5 more
good operators.

390
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,741
Then we hit them hard.
Hit them where they live.

391
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:15,496
No. This war stays cold for now.

392
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,377
What about their message?
What's the answer?

393
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:30,219
Set up a meeting.
Let's see what they have to say.

394
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,306
How did he do today?

395
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,872
I hear you can
handle yourself.

396
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,792
I guess.

397
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,378
Good night.

398
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,880
Hey, excuse me?

399
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,467
Why me?

400
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:15,097
I like to think
I see things in people.

401
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:45,085
Slow down. The car
is not going anywhere.

402
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,381
Mom.

403
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,508
Hey, sweetheart.

404
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,511
Hi.
Hey.

405
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,472
Whew.

406
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,893
So did you see what's in the driveway?
There you go.

407
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,896
Uh, yeah, l saw.

408
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,939
Hey.

409
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,194
So that's yours, huh?

410
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,821
Yeah.
Dad got it for me.

411
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,324
Well, that was
very nice of him.

412
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,618
Yeah. Heh.

413
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,954
I know it looks like...

414
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,917
well, awesome, but it's super safe.

415
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,543
Dad made sure.

416
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:30,047
And I promise to always go
the speed limit. Or below.

417
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,381
Way below.

418
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:36,136
And it gets great gas mileage.

419
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:42,267
So Dad said l can take it around
the block a few times. That okay?

420
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,895
Just around the block.

421
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:48,106
Yeah. Just around
the block.

422
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,152
And be careful, okay?
I will.

423
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,446
Bye.

424
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,869
It's really-- lt's really great
to have you home, Mom.

425
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,879
Hey, seriously,
be careful. Okay?

426
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,965
I will.
Okay.

427
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,068
I guess we should talk.

428
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:36,405
Well, I think you said
plenty the other day.

429
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:40,450
Look, about that, it just...

430
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,704
Did you get
the car wash keys?

431
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:48,500
Um, yes. Yes. Here.

432
00:43:54,924 --> 00:44:01,221
Skyler, I may have
overstated things earlier

433
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:05,559
and I'm sorry
to be so forward.

434
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:10,063
But l just-- l want you
to know something.

435
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,898
I want you to--

436
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,776
I need you to understand

437
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,154
that you are safe.

438
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:22,701
You, Junior, Holly.
You are completely safe.

439
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:27,748
Everything that l do,
everything,

440
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,168
I do it to protect this family.

441
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:37,007
So buying that car,
that was protecting your family?

442
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,346
Okay. I...

443
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,267
All right, maybe
it's a little flashy,
but he needed a car,

444
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:52,564
and I'm his father,
and I should be able
to get what he wants.

445
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,861
It goes back.

446
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,613
Tomorrow.

447
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,283
Skyler, it will crush him.

448
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,372
That car directly
contradicts our story.

449
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:12,084
And if you're so invested
in protecting this family,

450
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,128
it means protecting the story.

451
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:18,215
What do you think the neighbors
are gonna say, Walt?

452
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:19,925
What about Hank and Marie?

453
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:24,012
How about the IRS?
What were you thinking, Walt?

454
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,975
I was thinking that l wanted
to do something nice for my son.

455
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,361
Look.

456
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,866
I just worry that
he'll blame you for this.

457
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,372
Oh, he will.

458
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,417
Once again,
he'll blame his bitch mother

459
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,546
for taking away what his
loving father has given him,

460
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:00,215
so thanks for that.

461
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,886
But you know what, Walt?

462
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,639
Someone has to protect
this family

463
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:11,101
from the man
who protects this family.
