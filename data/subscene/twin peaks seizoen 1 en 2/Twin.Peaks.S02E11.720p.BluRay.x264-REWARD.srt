1
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,716
I don't wanna alarm you
but Garland has disappeared before.

2
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,343
Granted it's always been work-related.

3
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,472
Agent Cooper,
did this seem work-related?

4
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,144
- Ma'am, that's hard to say.
- Mm.

5
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:13,442
So, Betty, you're saying this behavior
is part of the way the major operates.

6
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,902
Let me ask you this.

7
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,864
Did he leave suddenly?

8
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,240
Yes, he did.

9
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,409
We were speaking philosophically,

10
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,370
and I left the campsite
to answer the call of nature.

11
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,080
When I returned he was gone.

12
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,752
The fact that you were in the woods
is very significant.

13
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,670
In what way?

14
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,259
Confidentially,

15
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,638
he talks about them constantly.

16
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,976
Ma'am, has the major, uh...

17
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,896
Clearly, a man
of no small spiritual advancement.

18
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:55,567
- Been attempting to contact
some element that lives in the woods

19
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,362
as a part of his top-secret work?

20
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,365
That's classified.

21
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:08,163
Well, he certainly has a renaissance
passion for exploration, doesn't he?

22
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,125
That is how he sees himself.

23
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,296
And there's no manual for it.

24
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,258
There's certainly no manual
to be married to it.

25
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,512
Betty, thanks for coming in.

26
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,890
I guess there's not much more
we can do right now,

27
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,517
except, keep our eyes peeled.

28
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,939
Uh, Garland left some notes
on his bedside table.

29
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,607
I can call you back with them.

30
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,192
They might be very helpful.

31
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,996
Harry, the major didn't just wander off
on some work-related assignment.

32
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:54,084
That flash of light I saw, it's a powerful
force that exists in those woods.

33
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,882
Sheriff, we found Mr.
and Mrs. Milford's wedding present.

34
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:05,429
It's a matching scarf and ascot set.

35
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,558
Good.
I still owe him a gift from last time.

36
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,477
I can't believe
that he's getting married again.

37
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,648
Dougie's weddings are a seasonal
thing. Like the return of the salmon.

38
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,110
Marry in haste, repent in leisure.

39
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,863
Hello, sheriff?

40
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,948
There's a call for a Dale Crewper.

41
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,910
Long distance. I hope I didn't cut it off.

42
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,622
Temp. Lucy's helping out
with the Milford wedding.

43
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,708
- Hmm.
- Coop?

44
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,668
Where are we?

45
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,047
This is Gordon Cole calling
from Bend, Oregon.

46
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,590
How are you doing, Gordon?

47
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,843
Coop, I just called to say
that you have my full support

48
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,678
in this investigation business.

49
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,141
These are hard times
but we get through them.

50
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,519
- Thank you, Gordon.
- It ranks poor with me too.

51
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,106
Now, Coop, is any of this true?

52
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,900
Double homicide?

53
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,985
Stolen drugs?

54
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,737
Storming a whorehouse?

55
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,447
It's all a bunch of hogwash.

56
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,991
I have to tell you
the Drug Enforcement Agency

57
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,534
is starting to nose around.

58
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,997
They're sending down a top dog
to investigate the drug angle.

59
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,041
Who are they sending?

60
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,337
It's Gordon.

61
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,464
It's Gordon Cole.

62
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,175
- Who's the agent?
- Oh!

63
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,676
Dennis Bryson.

64
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,554
It's Bryson. He's a good man, Harry.
No nonsense.

65
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,890
Don't let him rattle you, Coop.

66
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,977
These guys make a living looking
through other people's drawers.

67
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,647
We've all had our socks
tossed around.

68
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,400
From time to time.

69
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,027
Couple of words of advice:

70
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,655
Let a smile be your umbrella.

71
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,990
- Thanks, Gordon.
- See you, Coop.

72
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,326
Well, Harry...

73
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,541
...time to face the music.

74
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,174
Good morning, Roger.

75
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,135
Gentlemen.

76
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,054
Agent Cooper.

77
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,223
It's showtime.

78
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,641
You've heard the charges.

79
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,103
What do you wish to present
as your defense?

80
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,855
I have no defense.

81
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,110
I am completely confident
in the rightness of my actions.

82
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,406
Some of it occurred outside of Bureau
guidelines, I will pay the price for that.

83
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,908
But I'm innocent
of any criminal wrongdoing.

84
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,537
If they wish to charge me,
I will defend myself in a court of law.

85
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,713
Dale.

86
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,966
There's a right way and a wrong way
to do this.

87
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,886
And the first thing we expect

88
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,347
is a Bureau man
to stand up for himself.

89
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,685
A man who can't,
who doesn't even try,

90
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:04,191
well, he may be packing feathers
where his spine is supposed to be.

91
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,028
Roger.

92
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,989
I know the moves
I'm supposed to make.

93
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,407
And I know the board.

94
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,242
So.

95
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,204
I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately.

96
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:22,250
And I've started to focus out
beyond the edge of the board.

97
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,628
At a bigger game.

98
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,963
What game?

99
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,594
The sound wind makes
through the pines.

100
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,013
The sentience of animals.

101
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,269
What we fear in the dark
and what lies beyond the darkness.

102
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,397
What the hell are you talking about?

103
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:53,114
I'm talking about seeing
beyond fear, Roger.

104
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,784
About looking at the world with love.

105
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:00,038
They're liable to extradite you
for murder and drug trafficking.

106
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,459
These are things I cannot control.

107
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,967
The suspension will remain in force.

108
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,678
The next move is up to the Canadian
government

109
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,056
and the DEA investigation
which begins today.

110
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,476
You've cracked a big case.

111
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,062
You've been under a lot of pressure.

112
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,940
I may recommend

113
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,317
a full psychological workup.

114
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,737
Thanks for your candor, Roger.

115
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,532
So long, fellas.

116
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,899
Donna, hi.

117
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,484
Hi, Nadine.

118
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,320
Have you heard anything from James?

119
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,031
You mean, Eddie's friend
with the motorcycle?

120
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,699
Yeah.

121
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,868
He hasn't been around
for a couple of days.

122
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,119
Listen,

123
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,956
I gotta ask you something and I hope
you don't think this is too personal.

124
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,750
What?

125
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,588
Well, are you still, like, going out
with Mike or anything?

126
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,423
No.

127
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,759
Yay!

128
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,137
- Why?
- You have to promise not to say.

129
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,431
- Promise, okay?
- Sure.

130
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,685
Well, I think there may be
some major chemistry developing bet...

131
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,439
Oh, my God, there he is.

132
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,608
Hi, Donna.

133
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,486
Hi, Mike.

134
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,119
He has the cutest buns.

135
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:08,124
Nadine, what about Ed?

136
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,002
Aren't you still seeing him?

137
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,213
Yeah, sort of.

138
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,927
Well, if you're still seeing Ed,
then how can you...

139
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,970
...how can you start seeing Mike?

140
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,767
Well, Eddie stays home
and Mike's at school.

141
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,353
Eddie likes to stay in,
Mike likes to go out.

142
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,272
And let's be realistic,
sometimes Eddie acts like

143
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,691
he's old enough to be my father.

144
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,068
I'll catch you later.

145
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,819
Could I get a beer?

146
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,531
- Hi.
- Hello.

147
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,450
Headed somewhere?

148
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,951
I'm sorry?

149
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,997
Is there some place you're going to
or running from?

150
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,002
You got the wrong guy. I'm all right.

151
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,296
Men are always all right.

152
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,965
Right up until they pull the trigger.

153
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,634
And then we watch the neighbors
solemnly march out

154
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,762
to the news cameras to tell us:

155
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,056
"He was such a nice, quiet guy."

156
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,685
Well, I'm only quiet on the outside.

157
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,521
I can almost hear what's inside
from here.

158
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,068
Live nearby?

159
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,113
Yeah, Twin Peaks.

160
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,910
It's a nice jacket.

161
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,622
I'm glad you think so.

162
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,750
- Look, can you do anything with cars?
- Yeah.

163
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,294
Why, you got a problem with
the 'Vette outside?

164
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,297
No. No, it's my husband's Jaguar.

165
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:23,635
Somebody squeezed me on
the highway, and I drove it to a ditch.

166
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:28,640
I think it would be a very good idea to
have it repaired before he gets home.

167
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,100
Well, I could take a look at it.

168
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,894
My name is James.

169
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,687
Evelyn.

170
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,524
Evelyn Marsh.
I live right up the road.

171
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,027
Well, are we in a hurry?

172
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,616
Do you mind if I play the box first?

173
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,662
I don't exactly punch a clock myself.

174
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,381
Good day, Dick.

175
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,341
Hello, Andy.

176
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:51,347
This is little Nicky, my charge
from Happy Helping Hand.

177
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,434
Nicky, this is Deputy Andy.

178
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,769
How do you do, young fella?

179
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,063
- Hi.
- Heh, heh.

180
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,857
Andrew, old boy.

181
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,902
Little Nicky and myself, we just came
from Horne's Department Store

182
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,154
where Nicky was fitted
for a new wardrobe.

183
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,197
And now we're on our way
for a malted.

184
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,700
We were hoping Lucy could come
with us.

185
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,828
Oh, shoot, Dick.
Lucy's up at the Great Northern,

186
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,371
helping with the Milford wedding.

187
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,874
Oh, God, that's right.

188
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,043
Dougie's getting married again.

189
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,171
Lucy's not here?

190
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,381
Does this mean we can't go out
for a malted?

191
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,885
Yes, unfortunately.
We'll have to go some other time.

192
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:33,097
- But you promised. Can't we go?
- Ah... Nicky. Ha-ha-ha.

193
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,266
You know, Dick,

194
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,644
it's close to my lunch hour.

195
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:43,358
If you'd like, Nicky, I'd sure enjoy
taking you two guys out for a malted.

196
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,402
- How would that be?
- Oh, boy.

197
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,289
So, what will you do

198
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,917
if we can't figure a way
to get you cleared?

199
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:05,588
Well, Harry, the Giant said a path is
formed by laying one stone at a time.

200
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,219
Have either of you fellas heard
of a place called the White Lodge?

201
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,974
Where did you hear of it?

202
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,395
Well, it was the last thing Major Briggs
said to me before he disappeared.

203
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,649
Cooper, you may be fearless
in this world.

204
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,442
But there are other worlds.

205
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,655
Tell me more.

206
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,826
My people believe that
the White Lodge is a place

207
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,496
where the spirits that rule
man and nature here reside.

208
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,041
Local legend. Goes way back.

209
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,129
There is also a legend of a place
called the Black Lodge,

210
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,423
the shadow self of the White Lodge.

211
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,844
Legend says that every spirit
must pass through there

212
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,263
on a way to perfection.

213
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:59,976
There, you will meet
your own shadow self.

214
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,312
My people call it: The Dweller
on the Threshold.

215
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,190
Dweller on the Threshold.

216
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,612
But it is said, if you confront the
Black Lodge with imperfect courage,

217
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,158
it will utterly annihilate your soul.

218
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,410
Agent Cooper,

219
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,829
Agent Bryson's here to see you.

220
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,039
Send him right in.

221
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,916
Dennis Bryson and I worked together
in Oakland.

222
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,920
One of the finest minds in the DEA.
Harry, we're in very good hands.

223
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,010
Coop.

224
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,472
Dennis?

225
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:44,270
It's a long story, but actually
I prefer Denise if you don't mind.

226
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,148
Okay.

227
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,816
Sheriff Truman.

228
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,902
- Pleased.
- Deputy Hawk.

229
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,822
Denise Bryson,
Drug Enforcement Agency.

230
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,785
Well, I had a nice ride out here,
sheriff.

231
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,079
It's hard to imagine
you have even any crime.

232
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:05,333
I picture you chasing lost dogs,
and locking up the town drunk.

233
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,711
Unfortunately, it's a little more
involved than that.

234
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,962
Hmm.

235
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,506
Let's get right to this, Dale.

236
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:16,094
The DEA's interest in you stems from
allegations made by an RCMP officer

237
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,222
that you stole drugs being used
by him in a sting operation.

238
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,974
Denise, I believe I'm being set up.

239
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:27,313
Well, my recent experiences taught me
never to judge too quickly.

240
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,527
Anyway, I'll get right to this

241
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,238
- and get back to you later.
- Okay.

242
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,657
I understand we're both staying
at the Great Northern.

243
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,950
How is the food up there?

244
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,036
Denise, you're in for a real surprise.

245
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,830
So are they.

246
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,874
Well, we'll catch up later.

247
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,045
- I wanna tell you all about my new life.
- Anxious to hear about it.

248
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,464
It's a pleasure to meet you, sheriff.

249
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,967
Mm.

250
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,176
Deputy.

251
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,355
That's a good color for him.

252
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,192
Look, is there something
you want?

253
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,027
Why, Mike.

254
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,112
Aren't we being a little forward?

255
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:03,659
Come on, guys. I wanna hear
some grunting and see some sweat.

256
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,121
Attaboy, Nelson.
Come on, pump it.

257
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,332
Pump it.

258
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,255
- Hey, what's your name, little lady?
- Nadine Butler.

259
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:20,593
Well, Nadine, ever give any thoughts
of going out for the wrestling team?

260
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,332
Josie.

261
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,168
It's time.

262
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,342
I can't be with you unless I know.

263
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,014
- Oh, Harry.
- The truth.

264
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,814
The truth.

265
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,031
I used to... work for a man
in Hong Kong.

266
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,201
His name is Thomas Eckhardt.

267
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,497
He helped me.

268
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,795
Took me off the streets
when I was 16.

269
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,633
We are from a poor family.

270
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,220
Sometimes they sell
their female children.

271
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,306
I was lucky.

272
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,728
He taught me about life...

273
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,147
...about business.

274
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,150
He was my father.

275
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,277
My master.

276
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,113
My lover.

277
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,786
When I met Andrew Packard,

278
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:55,206
I was already afraid for my life.

279
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,459
Andrew was also
a business partner.

280
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,005
When Andrew asked me to marry him,

281
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,548
I said yes.

282
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,720
Who was this Mr. Lee?

283
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,348
Who is this... this cousin?

284
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,683
I'm sorry, Harry.

285
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,353
I was just trying
to keep you out of this.

286
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:21,065
- The less you know, the better.
- Who was he?

287
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,860
He works for Eckhardt.

288
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,657
He said if I didn't go back with him,
he'd kill you.

289
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,911
Why?

290
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,540
Because Eckhardt wants me.

291
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,419
He's never stopped wanting me.
He thinks I'm his property.

292
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:45,172
When Andrew was alive,
he could protect me.

293
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,593
I now believe...

294
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:55,182
...Eckhardt is the man
responsible for Andrew's death.

295
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:02,565
We were... We were in the airport
in Seattle.

296
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,151
And I just escaped.

297
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,321
I'd rather die.

298
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,409
I'd rather die than go back
to that monster.

299
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,536
Josie.

300
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,040
Josie, you will never have
to go back there.

301
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,376
You're with me now...

302
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,044
And now...

303
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,881
...he'll kill the both of us.

304
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,217
No.

305
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,768
Let him try.

306
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,160
Sorry, it took so long,

307
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,913
- but we're short on help today.
- That's quite all right.

308
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,875
I've been looking forward to this pie.
I've heard so much about it.

309
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,960
You won't be disappointed.

310
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,758
Hey, I... I'll get you anything
you want. Just sit down.

311
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,719
Hey, sweetheart.
Could we get some coffee?

312
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,389
- How was your hunting expedition?
- It was a little fatiguing.

313
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,023
- Catch anything?
- I hope not.

314
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,568
Oh, catch anything. Uh...

315
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,946
Yeah, I...

316
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:36,825
I came across a 12-point buck, you
know, standing by a deepwater pool.

317
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:43,207
So, uh, I made this very soft approach
and I lined him up dead center: Pow!

318
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,918
You should have had your camera.

319
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,253
Are you having it mounted?

320
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:53,008
Oh, yeah, yeah, even as we speak.
It was great, just great. Um...

321
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,136
I think I better go
and check on your mama.

322
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,223
She's not here, Ernie.
She's gone back to Seattle.

323
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:00,891
Seattle?

324
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,937
And that's where I think
you should go too.

325
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,705
Hey, buddy,
what's with the long face?

326
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:26,166
- Vivian's gone back to Seattle.
- Better for you, buckeroo.

327
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:30,379
We got four kilos to unload. You want
the ball-and-chain getting in the way?

328
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,881
Yeah, I suppose you are right.

329
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,342
There's the phone, hotrod.

330
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,595
We're on a deadline.

331
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,104
Here we go. Two three-berry pies

332
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,232
and one super snow frost
chocolate malted.

333
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,109
Wow, thanks.

334
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,655
Looks just like Whitetail Mountain,
doesn't it, Nicky?

335
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:57,906
How much does it cost?

336
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,952
Oh, money is no object,
little Nicholas. Ha-ha-ha.

337
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,622
Aah! Damn. Damn.

338
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,582
Damn.

339
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,000
Sorry, Uncle Dick.

340
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,418
It's okay, Nicky.

341
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,129
Uncle Dick isn't mad.
Are you, Uncle Dick?

342
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:17,009
Uncle Dick is simply ripping, thank
you. Pass me a napkin, Uncle Andy.

343
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,852
- Oh.
- Ha-ha-ha.

344
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,730
Gosh darn it, anyway.

345
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,398
Sorry, Uncle Andy.

346
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,776
Think nothing of it, little Nicky.

347
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,196
Uncle Andy went funny boom-boom,
didn't he?

348
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,497
I think I can put this right.

349
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,042
It is beautiful.

350
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,795
Jeffrey loves this car.

351
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,005
My husband.

352
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,174
He loves this car.

353
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,636
Where is your husband, Mrs. Marsh?

354
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,513
I don't know this week.

355
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,640
He travels extensively.

356
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,600
Business.

357
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,437
This car was built in 1948.

358
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,900
Jeffrey has to have the most unique
and beautiful toys.

359
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,236
They have to be perfect.

360
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,322
He's that way
about everything he owns.

361
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,576
I could have learned something from
that if I'd been paying attention.

362
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,870
Are you that way, James?

363
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,164
Are you that way about your bike?

364
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,583
I guess I'm not so interested
in how my bike looks

365
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,460
as I am in where it can take me.

366
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,629
Where do you wanna go?

367
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,341
It's not really a place, it's a feeling.

368
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,221
Sometimes, riding at night...

369
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,269
...I punch off the headlights
and roll on the throttle...

370
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,605
...and just rocket blind into the dark.

371
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,154
So...

372
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,615
...do you think you could fix it?

373
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,576
Yeah.

374
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,912
There's a room above the garage.

375
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,540
You can stay there if you like
while you work.

376
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,003
Room and board and anything else
you think is fair.

377
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:20,174
I really do need to have this fixed
before Jeffrey gets home.

378
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,968
I'd like you to stay, James.

379
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,387
I'd enjoy the company.

380
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,015
Okay.

381
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,516
Good.

382
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,936
It's settled then. I'll leave you to it.

383
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:48,387
Now is the winter of our discontent

384
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:54,852
Made glorious summer
by this sun of York;

385
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:25,007
Now are our brows bound
with victorious wreaths;

386
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,681
A stag party?

387
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,558
And I wasn't even invited?

388
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,979
Where the hell have you been?

389
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:44,818
Ben, I have had an absolutely
killer schedule.

390
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,087
Do you know the kind of hell
that I have been through

391
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,423
in the last few days?

392
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:12,262
You said that you took care
of Catherine in the mill fire.

393
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,056
She's alive.

394
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,851
And as you might imagine,
not a happy camper.

395
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,646
Through trickery...

396
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,606
...extortion...

397
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:28,028
She has managed
to cheat me out of both.

398
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:31,031
Both Ghostwood and the mill.

399
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,493
Then there is the, uh...

400
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:38,413
...small matter of being arrested
for the killing of...

401
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,706
...Laura Palmer.

402
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,543
A real business-enhancer.

403
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:50,467
On top of which, my trusted solicitor,
the late Leland Palmer...

404
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:54,262
...turns out to be
a homicidal lunatic.

405
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,973
Tough week, Ben.

406
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:02,354
Do you think the furniture
in this room is adequately arranged?

407
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,857
I have been toying with the notion

408
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,111
that if one could find

409
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,865
the perfect arrangement
of all objects in any particular space,

410
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:18,161
it could create a resonance
the benefits from which

411
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:22,666
to the individual dwelling in that
space could be, uh...

412
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,837
...could be extensive,
could be far-reaching, far-reaching.

413
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,090
Would you help me with this desk?

414
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,718
That's fascinating, Ben, really.

415
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,471
Listen, though, what we have to talk
about now...

416
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,723
...is One-Eyed Jack's.

417
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,891
Jack's, Jack's. Yes, One-Eyed Jack's.

418
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,476
Look, here's how it is, Ben.

419
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,729
Ben.

420
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:45,981
You're out.

421
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,817
Excuse me?

422
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,571
I own One-Eyed Jack's.

423
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,742
There's been a friendly takeover.

424
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:05,250
You come in here under my employ
and have the gall to tell me...

425
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,335
Oh, that's another thing.

426
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,880
I don't work for you anymore.

427
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,137
Renault.

428
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,056
Jean Renault.

429
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,063
It's Renault, isn't it? Hank.

430
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,106
Let me tell you something.

431
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,109
The guy is a psychopath.

432
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,488
Psychopath.

433
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:39,242
And you, my friend,
are dancing with the devil.

434
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,787
Ben, you're a nut.

435
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,705
You think I'm just gonna sit here?

436
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,416
Mm? Let you take all this.

437
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,710
Ben.

438
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,796
Life is change.

439
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:55,675
I want you to listen to me when I
tell you that this is how it's gonna be.

440
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:00,263
Don't patronize me, you goon.

441
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,768
You're a mess, Ben. Look at you.

442
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,646
You screwed up, boss man.

443
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,690
You're out, Ben.

444
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,250
"You're out, Ben.

445
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,757
You're out, Ben. Ha-ha-ha!

446
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,760
Mm!

447
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:42,514
You're out. Ben, you're out.

448
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,606
Ben, you're out."

449
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,661
Windom Earle.

450
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,439
Of course,
you couldn't help but take note of

451
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,525
my emphatically traditional
opening.

452
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,778
I must say,
your responding move was nothing

453
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:43,909
if not reflective of your predilection
for the tidy and fastidious.

454
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,078
See how my response to you
begins to lead us

455
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,248
towards a classical
confrontation?

456
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,876
But there's doubt in your mind.

457
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,171
What are my true intentions?

458
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,424
How will you answer this time?

459
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,843
Hobgoblins, Dale.

460
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:07,098
Consistency, predictability,
giving rise to patterns.

461
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,975
We both know only too well

462
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:13,146
how these patterns leave you
vulnerable to attack.

463
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,898
You with your wounds.

464
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,650
I with mine.

465
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,152
Let me paint you a picture.

466
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,112
My knights will skirmish.

467
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:25,951
Lanes of power and influence will
open to my bishops and rooks.

468
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,536
Pawns will naturally be forfeit.

469
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,666
I'm even prepared to sacrifice
my queen because I assure you,

470
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:37,420
dear Dale, my goal will be attained
at any cost.

471
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,549
The king must die.

472
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:51,184
Do you, Douglas Milford,
take this woman to be your wife...

473
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:55,230
...to love and to cherish,
for as long as you both shall live?

474
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,738
You bet, I do, Reverend.

475
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,909
If there be anyone who knows not
why this union should be made,

476
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,079
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

477
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,456
You're damn right. I want to object.

478
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:17,794
This little gold digger
just wants his money,

479
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,130
and his publishing empire,

480
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,965
and God knows what all.

481
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,591
And look at him,

482
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,761
he's got one foot
in the grave already. Ha-ha-ha.

483
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,265
Okay, Dwayne,
okay, just take her easy.

484
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,850
- Take her easy.
- All right.

485
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,853
You know that I have had problems,
sheriff. All these years.

486
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,230
Okay, Mr. Mayor,
let's just get a little air. Shall we?

487
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,940
It's pretty peculiar, isn't it?

488
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,942
Don't give it another thought, doll.

489
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,446
- Well, I know this is my opinion,
- Let's get out, let's just get out.

490
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,073
- And I want you to all understand it.
- Excuse us.

491
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,035
Marrying every two months...
Good God.

492
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,414
So if there be no further objections...

493
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,966
Cooper here.

494
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,843
Denise.

495
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,929
Well, that'll be nice.
I'll be right down.

496
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,689
Diane, when I've got a moment,

497
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:23,026
remind me to tell you
about Agent Bryson.

498
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,095
I just love Milford weddings.

499
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,138
Unfair advantage.

500
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,557
How many of those girls
were varsity wide receivers?

501
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,518
Very few.

502
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,063
Bad news first.

503
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,273
I found cocaine residue in your car.

504
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,693
And my guess is it will match the lot
stolen from the Mountie.

505
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,571
- Dennis, this can't appear straight.
- Denise.

506
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,866
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

507
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,827
Sure it looks like a frame, Coop.

508
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,621
But I'm gonna need more than
your opinion to make that stick.

509
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,998
Can you help me?

510
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,126
Well, that gets
into a very delicate area.

511
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,088
But on the other hand,
I'm trying very hard, recently,

512
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,465
to get more in touch
with my feelings.

513
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,222
Ladies and gentlemen, the cake.

514
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,642
Dougie's always been a sucker.

515
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,894
Let a woman pass...

516
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,021
...with play in her eyes...

517
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:46,276
...and Jell-O in her walk,
and he's a trout on a hook. Ha-ha-ha.

518
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,369
So, Denise,

519
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,206
if you don't mind my asking,

520
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,001
- what happened to you?
- No, not at all.

521
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,752
I like to talk about it.

522
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,379
It's really very simple.

523
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,799
Last year, I was working undercover
suburban surveillance

524
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,302
and the seller had a few kinks
in his rep.

525
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,430
It seems that he'd only sell
to transvestites.

526
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,057
So my partner and I shacked up.

527
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,602
I played the part of the buyer.

528
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:25,648
And I found that wearing women's
clothes...

529
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,359
...relaxed me.

530
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,029
I continued wearing them
into the night.

531
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:35,366
My partner thought it was
my consummate professionalism. Heh.

532
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,952
It was a very confusing two weeks.

533
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,414
Well, this is all
a pretty amazing disclosure,

534
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,665
Denise.

535
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,252
Imagine how surprised I was, Coop.

536
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,630
This is not exactly
something you plan on.

537
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,048
Guess not.

538
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,885
- Sheriff.
- Harry.

539
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,512
I'll have a draft.

540
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,473
Sheriff, arrest this woman.

541
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,142
She's too beautiful to be living
in this state.

542
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,646
Oh, hey, aren't you that FBI man?

543
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,981
Not currently, no.

544
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,316
Dale Cooper.

545
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,026
Dale.

546
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,403
You solved
that Laura Palmer case, huh?

547
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:16,741
Come on, darling,
they're playing our tune. See you.

548
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,249
I sure hope those two go up
to the honeymoon suite soon.

549
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,210
We've had to separate Dwayne
and Dougie twice already.

550
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,045
Happens every wedding.

551
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,672
Boys will be boys.

552
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:35,301
I was married to the same woman
for half a century.

553
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,680
God rest her soul.

554
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:43,309
That's because I used my brain
for thinking, not my garden hose.

555
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,021
This cake is delicious.

556
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,653
The music...

557
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,780
...turned out pretty good.

558
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,160
It ought have been the death march.
Ha, ha.

559
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,127
You're an excellent dancer.

560
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,962
The wonderful thing about dancing,
Audrey,

561
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,047
is that you never know
where the step could lead.

562
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:16,134
You have to hang on
and hope the music takes you there.

563
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:31,357
Your brother,
my husband, Andrew Packard,

564
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,486
was killed by a man
named Thomas Eckhardt.

565
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,906
Tell me something
I don't already know.

566
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:43,036
You're in terrible danger, Catherine.

567
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,915
You helped kill my brother,

568
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:54,297
tried to cheat me out of my land,
my family's lifeblood,

569
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:58,968
utterly destroy my existence,
and now you want to save me?

570
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:03,431
I had to do these things to stay alive.

571
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,810
I have no one to turn to now.

572
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,105
I've got nothing.

573
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,609
And I'm at your mercy.

574
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,029
Oh.

575
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,947
Now...

576
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,491
...enough.

577
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,119
Let's be practical.

578
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,955
What do you propose we do?

579
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,875
I don't know.

580
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,794
Then I'll tell you.

581
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,463
From now on...

582
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,425
...you work for me.

583
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,803
Here.

584
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,513
At the house.

585
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:44,972
As a maid.

586
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,309
You move your things
into the servant's quarters.

587
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,645
If you disobey me,

588
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,190
if you lie to me,

589
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:59,487
if you contradict
a single thing I tell you,

590
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,783
I shall find this Eckhardt

591
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,620
and feed you to him by hand.

592
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,206
Is that clear?

593
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,126
Speak!

594
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,379
Yes, I understand.

595
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,423
Fine.

596
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:22,051
We'll talk about this Eckhardt
some other time.

597
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,470
You may go to your room.

598
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,557
Thank you.

599
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,560
Josie...

600
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:35,189
I'll take breakfast at 7 in my room.

601
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,902
Coffee, juice,
dry toast, oatmeal.

602
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,990
- Yes.
- Sweet dreams.

603
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,667
Happy, Andrew?

604
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:01,549
Everything is going exactly
as we planned.

605
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,176
And now?

606
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,262
And now, dear sister,
we wait for Thomas Eckhardt

607
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:11,809
to come looking
for his one true love.

608
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,229
And when he does...

609
00:46:16,732 --> 00:47:23,965
We'll be waiting for him.
