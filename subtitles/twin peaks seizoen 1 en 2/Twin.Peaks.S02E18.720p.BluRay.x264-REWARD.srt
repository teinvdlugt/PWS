1
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,101
Do you like that?

2
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,375
Oh, Harry.

3
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,337
Josie.

4
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,631
Yes.

5
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,802
Yes, it's me.

6
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,137
I'm here.

7
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:29,685
- Josie.
- Harry, I'm here.

8
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,729
Josie...

9
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,636
Room service.

10
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,431
Come on in. It's open.

11
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,729
You can just put it on the table.

12
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,856
Audrey.

13
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,524
I trust your sleep was untroubled?

14
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,777
Here at The Great Northern,
we aim to make your stay

15
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,405
as comfortable
and as enjoyable as possible.

16
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:09,576
You know, we take the concept
of room service very seriously.

17
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,286
Oh.

18
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,623
Do you remember
your grandfather?

19
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:15,874
Mm-hm.

20
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,918
Colorful man,
one of the wisest I ever met.

21
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,836
You know what he once said?

22
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,006
He said if you're gonna bring
a hammer, you better bring nails.

23
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,009
What's that supposed to mean?

24
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,345
What that means is the next time
you come into my room

25
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,389
and carry on,
you'd better be ready to finish

26
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,057
whatever it is you came here to start.

27
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,145
- Maybe I'm ready now.
- Then be yourself.

28
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,899
I am being myself.

29
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,902
You're right.

30
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,695
You're absolutely right.

31
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,448
I stand corrected. You're a beautiful,
intelligent young woman.

32
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,701
What else?

33
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,453
Uh...

34
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:58,333
You have an undeniable
magic about you

35
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,003
that inspires a plan.

36
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,673
Flight at sunset and dinner for two?

37
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,135
- When?
- What, the flight or the sunset?

38
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,097
Well, I have to go to the library and
have a meeting with my father later.

39
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,057
A simple yes or no would do.

40
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,102
Yes.

41
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:26,194
And if you bring a hammer,
you better bring some nails too.

42
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,126
Anything?

43
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,130
No, not a word. She wants to speak
to the South African consulate.

44
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,591
In Twin Peaks?

45
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,303
Why would Eckhardt want me dead?

46
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,389
Sexual jealousy.

47
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,600
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hm.

48
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,310
It's good to have you back, Harry.

49
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,770
Taken me a day
or so to get my sea legs.

50
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,440
Well, to be honest, it looks like
you went down with the ship.

51
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,108
Why don't you go home
and recuperate?

52
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,945
No, all I need is some coffee,
maybe a little food.

53
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,281
Sure-fire cure for a hangover, Harry.

54
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,075
You take a glass of nearly frozen,
unstrained tomato juice.

55
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,578
You plop a couple of oysters in there,
you drink it down.

56
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,787
Breathe deeply.

57
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,332
Next, you take a mound,
and I mean a mound, of sweetbreads,

58
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,709
sauté them with some chestnuts
and some Canadian bacon.

59
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,419
Finally, biscuits.

60
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,505
Big biscuits, smothered in gravy.

61
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,424
Now, here's where it gets tricky.
You're gonna need some anchovies...

62
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,718
Excuse me.

63
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,140
That should do it.

64
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,606
The bonsai. The ultimate miniature.

65
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,109
Bicarbonate of soda,
the ultimate digestive aid.

66
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,699
Harry, quaff in good health.

67
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,369
- Thank you.
- Mm.

68
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,833
Where the hell did that come from?

69
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,419
It was delivered this morning.

70
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,970
It's from Josie.

71
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,392
Harry, Windom Earle
was at my house.

72
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,106
Windom Earle. When?

73
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,943
Yesterday. He left this with Donna.

74
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,072
He's closing in, Harry.

75
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,659
Knight to King Bishop 3.
What do we do?

76
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,744
We publish our next move today.

77
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,871
Thanks, Lucy.

78
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,456
Brace yourself, Harry.

79
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,167
- Agent Dale Cooper.
- Gordon Cole.

80
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,211
Sure sorry to interrupt you fellas.

81
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,839
But, Coop, I'm bringing you
the classified portion

82
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,800
of the Windom Earle dossier.

83
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,218
Back from Bend?

84
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,803
Been on over to Bend, Oregon.

85
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,472
Whole lot of shaking
going on down in Bend.

86
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,269
Enter Gordon Cole.

87
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,650
This is so galling, Leo.

88
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:15,030
Young Dale is continually refusing
to play fair!

89
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,324
When Earle went boi-oi-oing,

90
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,493
the doctors discovered
he was on haloperidol.

91
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,246
The same drug the one-armed man,
Gerard, was on.

92
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,666
- What's that?
- Gerard used the same drug.

93
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,876
You got it.

94
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,420
But they figured he was using
the drug to fake his illness,

95
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,213
just as you suspected, Coop.

96
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,716
Definite schizoid maneuvering.

97
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,390
"Project Blue Book"?

98
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,392
My God, Gordon,
what was he doing on this?

99
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,396
The Bureau loaned Earle out
to the Air Force in 1965.

100
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,941
Reports on his two-year hitch
are blacked out. National security.

101
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,151
Wait a minute.

102
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,362
Earle was investigating UFOs?

103
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,572
Major Briggs, Harry.

104
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,575
Gordon, there are some
curious linkages here.

105
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,828
The word "linkage"
reminds me of sausage.

106
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,374
Never cared much for the links,
preferred the patties.

107
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,919
But breakfast is a real good idea.

108
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,128
Bonsai.

109
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,798
Remember those
old World War II movies?

110
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,466
Bonsai!

111
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,427
Damnation!

112
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,686
Good to see you again, doc.
Sheriff, we'll be riding with you.

113
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,062
Cruiser's right outside.

114
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,772
Hold it one second there, Coop.

115
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,108
You'd better dust off
your own black suit.

116
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,318
With Windom Earle
rolling around loose on the deck,

117
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,237
we need you back on the team.

118
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,905
What are you saying, Gordon?

119
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,574
Coop, it gives me great pleasure
to reinstate you

120
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:45,328
into the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

121
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,375
Brand-new issue,
more accurate and efficient.

122
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,585
Smith & Wesson, ten millimeter.

123
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,673
Model 1076, all stainless steel.

124
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,343
It's a beautiful weapon, Coop,
and it's all yours.

125
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,886
Thank you, Gordon.

126
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,849
Cooper, we're gonna find Earle.
We will pursue,

127
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,352
- capture and incarcerate.
- Capture and incarcerate.

128
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,938
Let's hit the road.

129
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,568
Come on, buster, I'm buying.

130
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,070
On your tail, Gordon.

131
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,324
Now, Leo...

132
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,163
...pick three cards.

133
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,588
One,

134
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,299
two,

135
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,260
three.

136
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,638
Queen Donna.

137
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,561
Queen Audrey.

138
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,190
Queen Shelly, good.

139
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,862
Now, see if you can find the king.

140
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,246
Little Dale.

141
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,543
Now, we need one more queen.

142
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,087
Let's see.

143
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,674
The queen of hearts.

144
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,760
Let me see.

145
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,096
Miss Twin Peaks.

146
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,684
Now, what do you get if you win?
You get a dozen roses,

147
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,979
a scholarship to the college
of your choice,

148
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,774
the accolades of your peers...

149
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,609
Oh, yes, I know.

150
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,737
You get to die.

151
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,158
A royal execution.

152
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,331
And Cooper

153
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,878
gets to watch.

154
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,097
Hello, Ben.

155
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,392
I need to talk to you.

156
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,700
How was everything, sir?

157
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,872
Unbelievable.

158
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,253
- Is Audrey Horne here?
- She's in the back. I'll get her for you.

159
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,546
Thanks.

160
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,256
Donna, hi.

161
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,217
Hi, Donna.

162
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,637
Hi.

163
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,100
- Hi, Donna.
- Hi.

164
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,478
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

165
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,483
This might sound a little strange.

166
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,901
What?

167
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:49,113
Would you know any reason
why my mom's visiting your dad?

168
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,282
Not offhand.

169
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:57,372
Okay, well, yesterday he came by
the house to see my mom.

170
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,666
And today she drove over here
to see him.

171
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,669
Maybe she's just helping him
with the Stop Ghostwood campaign.

172
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,214
No, she would have said something
to me, and she hasn't said a word.

173
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,593
Is she here now?

174
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,929
They're in his office together.

175
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,144
No, I won't accept them.

176
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,771
They're your letters.

177
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,773
They were written to you.

178
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,274
I don't want them.

179
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,528
I won't have them
in my house any longer.

180
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,280
You've had them for 20 years.

181
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,116
Why now?

182
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,202
That's just what I'm asking you.
Why now?

183
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,706
They'll only succeed
in ripping apart old wounds.

184
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,375
I can't bear the thought of it.

185
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,879
Eileen.

186
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:51,092
Eileen, why don't you believe me?

187
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,301
Words aren't good enough.

188
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,638
I want my actions to speak for me.
Haven't you been listening?

189
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,765
I have been wrong all these years.

190
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,602
I am trying to make up for it.

191
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,398
Sometimes making up for things
only makes it worse.

192
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,026
Oh, Eileen.

193
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:14,741
You should have been the best thing
that ever happened to me.

194
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,535
Ben, please.

195
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,457
I haven't held you since that night.

196
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,417
Don't.

197
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,253
Oh, I wanna hold you.

198
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,881
I wanna go back.

199
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,259
- God, if you'd just...
- Please, don't!

200
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,892
I'm sorry.

201
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,901
- Have you told her?
- God, no.

202
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,363
Never. I never will.
And you must promise me the same.

203
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,533
You mustn't come over again.

204
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,079
You must stay away from her.

205
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,249
I understand.

206
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,585
I hope you do.

207
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,013
What the hell was that all about?

208
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,808
I don't know.

209
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,106
But I'm gonna find out.

210
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,318
Harry, the best cure I ever came
across for a hangover

211
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,113
was raw meat, and plenty of it.

212
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,614
You break an egg on it.

213
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:42,703
Add in some salted anchovies,
Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce.

214
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,832
If you want,
we can order up some for you.

215
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,546
Now that I come to mention it, Coop,
you know what I'm in the mood for?

216
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,755
What's that, Gordon?

217
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,841
A steak so rare
you could sell it at Tiffany's.

218
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,677
Well, you've come to the right place.

219
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,263
Good deal.

220
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,517
Holy smokes, who is that?

221
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,854
Shelly Johnson.

222
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,023
Shelly Johnson!

223
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,530
What a beauty.

224
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,033
Kind of reminds me of that statue,
the babe without the arms.

225
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,578
- Venus de Milo.
- The name was Milo,

226
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,913
but that's beside the point.

227
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,417
That's the kind of girl to make you wish
you spoke a little French.

228
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:36,716
Excuse me, Coop, while I try my hand
at a little counter Esperanto.

229
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,968
Good luck, Gordon.

230
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,055
Hello.

231
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:47,310
I was wondering if I might trouble you
for a cup of strong black coffee

232
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,895
and in the process,

233
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:53,191
engage you with an anecdote
of no small amusement.

234
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,277
The name is Gordon Cole,

235
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,696
and I couldn't help
but notice you from the booth.

236
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,700
And, well, seeing your beauty now,

237
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:07,246
I feel as though my stomach is filled
with a team of bumblebees.

238
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,707
You don't have to shout.
I can hear you.

239
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:14,420
I heard that.

240
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,048
Um, do you want anything
besides coffee?

241
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,966
I heard you perfectly.

242
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,010
And I can hear you, honest, please...

243
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,554
You don't understand.

244
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,806
You don't understand, Miss Johnson.

245
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,892
- Do you see these?
- Uh-huh.

246
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,728
For 20 years, I've been
asking people to please speak up,

247
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,398
but for some weird reason,
I can hear you clear as a bell.

248
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,983
Say something else.

249
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,236
Um, uh...

250
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,029
Do you want pie with your coffee?

251
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,241
Good Lord. I can hear you perfectly.

252
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,286
This is like some kind of miracle.
A phenomenon.

253
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,664
- What's wrong with miracles?
- What's that?

254
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,502
This cherry pie is a miracle.

255
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,966
Would you please ask the lady
with the log to speak up?

256
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:04,178
Um, the pie.
She was talking about the cherry pie.

257
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,473
I heard you again. I heard you again.

258
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,309
Would you like some pie?

259
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,812
Massive, massive quantities.

260
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,399
And a glass of water, sweetheart.
My socks are on fire.

261
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,048
Harry.

262
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,011
That looks like a chickadee
on a Dodge Dart.

263
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:49,598
No, it looks like a finch
on a Dodge Dart.

264
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,518
Nope, chickadee on a Dodge Dart.

265
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,982
- Hi.
- Hi. Cup of deep black joe?

266
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,567
You bet.

267
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,614
What do you recommend
for a hangover?

268
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,742
Teetotaling and prayer.

269
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,452
Good answer.

270
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,246
I'll try some coffee.

271
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,416
How are you today?

272
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,502
I'm fine.

273
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,879
I'm weird, actually.

274
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,672
I'm disoriented.

275
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,216
I'm not sure where I am.
I mean, I know where I am,

276
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,802
but it feels odd being here.

277
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,095
I'm okay.

278
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,556
Okay.

279
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,975
Listen to me.
I've been out of circulation so long,

280
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,644
I've completely forgotten
the social niceties.

281
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,979
I mean, you ask me how I am,

282
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,731
I'm not really supposed
to say how I am.

283
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,817
I'm supposed to say,
"I'm fine, thanks. How are you?"

284
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,153
I'm fine, thanks.

285
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,949
You must think I'm really strange.

286
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,409
No.

287
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,453
Well, with due respect
to the social niceties,

288
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,915
even if you did think I was strange,
you wouldn't tell me, would you?

289
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,417
No, if I thought you were strange,
I'd tell you.

290
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,711
And you don't think so?

291
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,588
Not a bit.

292
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,050
Good. Glad we got that cleared up.

293
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,803
So, what will you have?

294
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,432
I would like a chicken potpie
and a large glass of milk, please.

295
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,102
Good choice.
All the major food groups represented.

296
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:20,981
Turkey sandwich, whole wheat,
lettuce, dollop of mayonnaise,

297
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,441
and I've got a joke for you.

298
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,486
Two penguins were walking
across an iceberg.

299
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,280
One penguin turned
to the second penguin and said:

300
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,366
"You look like
you're wearing a tuxedo."

301
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,617
Annie?

302
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,786
I heard that.

303
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,539
Wait a minute. I'll be right back.

304
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,166
I wasn't quite finished.

305
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,129
How long you been
in love with her?

306
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,590
Harry, who said anything
about love?

307
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:51,220
Coop, you just tried to tell her a joke.

308
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,597
I did?

309
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,812
So, what did
the second penguin say?

310
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,606
Well, the first penguin said
to the second penguin:

311
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,650
"You look like
you're wearing a tuxedo."

312
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,612
And the second penguin said,
"Maybe I am."

313
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,743
The defense rests.

314
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,788
Do you want some more pie?
A whole pie?

315
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,667
Yes, I would, Miss Johnson,
and a piece of paper and a pencil.

316
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:25,421
I plan on writing an epic poem
about this gorgeous pie.

317
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,923
Okay.

318
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,640
I see that you've been to Owl Cave.

319
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,893
Sorry?

320
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,104
Well, that design looks like
the one up at Owl Cave.

321
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,899
Let me see that.

322
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,485
I combined Major Briggs' tattoo
with the Log Lady's.

323
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,364
This looks exactly
like the one at Owl Cave.

324
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,744
Harry, I've got to see this Owl Cave.

325
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,473
Dear Donna,

326
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,434
You were right, I had to go.

327
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,854
Everything feels different
when you're on the road.

328
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,232
It feels better.

329
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,734
San Francisco's really cool.

330
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,195
Next stop, Mexico.

331
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,572
I'll be back with a million stories.

332
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,407
I promise.

333
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,619
I love you, James.

334
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,713
James?

335
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,840
How is he?

336
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,676
He's good.

337
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,928
He's doing what he needed to do.

338
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,556
He'll be back.

339
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:05,020
Dad, can I ask you something?

340
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,605
Sure.

341
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,899
How does Mom know
Benjamin Horne?

342
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:13,070
I doubt that she does, Donna.
Not very well.

343
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,072
He was over here yesterday.

344
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,366
They were talking like old friends.

345
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,743
Your mother works a lot
with the local charities.

346
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,163
I'm sure even Ben contributes
once in a while.

347
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,875
She drove to The Great Northern
this morning to see him again.

348
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:30,337
Ah, probably something to do
with a fundraiser.

349
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,547
I don't think so.

350
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,926
Yeah, that's exactly what it was.
She told me at breakfast.

351
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,554
One of those heal-the-planet things.

352
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,391
Well, she didn't mention it to me.

353
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,394
Well, that's exactly what it was.
That's what she told me.

354
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,524
I'll get it.

355
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,781
Hi, I have a delivery for Mrs. Hayward.

356
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,458
They said they're for Mom.

357
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,668
No card.

358
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,463
I'll put them in water.

359
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,822
Aah! Sorry, sorry, my fault. Heh.

360
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,075
- Oh... I didn't hear you.
- No.

361
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,244
One should never allow
one's mind and one's foot

362
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,788
to wander at the same time.

363
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,626
Edward Perkins.
Once again, my apologies.

364
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,961
Audrey Horne.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Perkins.

365
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,256
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
So, what brings you to the library?

366
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,884
I'm doing research
on civil disobedience.

367
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,304
Good for you. It is incumbent
on the young to disobey.

368
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,306
Ha, ha. Are you a professor?

369
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,519
Well, I teach.
Poetry is my area of expertise.

370
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,106
You're kidding. You know, someone
sent me a poem. Maybe you know it.

371
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:15,067
Oh, perhaps I do.
Now, let's have a look.

372
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,362
Oh. Hmm.

373
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,364
You read it.

374
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,409
Okay.

375
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,870
See the mountains kiss high heaven
And the waves clasp one another

376
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,916
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdain'd its brother

377
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,628
And the sunlight clasps the earth
And the moonbeams kiss the sea

378
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:41,760
What is all this sweet work worth
If thou kiss not me?

379
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,262
Yeah, you know it.

380
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,056
Yes. Shelley.

381
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,309
What?

382
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,645
Gazing at you

383
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,606
reciting the verse of Shelley,

384
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:58,235
you look very much like a queen.

385
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,072
Thank you.

386
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,782
Um...

387
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,660
I guess I better be going.
Nice meeting you.

388
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,996
- Perhaps we'll meet again someday.
- Yeah.

389
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,142
- Thinking of entering?
- Heh. No.

390
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,936
I think the real world's strange enough
without getting on-stage

391
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,522
and parading around
in a bathing suit and heels.

392
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,025
Guess the convent's not too big
on that kind of stuff.

393
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,985
That's a good guess.

394
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,614
So, what's it like being back
in civilization?

395
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,825
It's not like they kept us
cooped up in an attic.

396
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,412
I mean, we had newspapers.
We even had cable TV.

397
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,249
Every time I tell someone where I've
been, they act like I'm out on parole.

398
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,127
Sorry.

399
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,882
You know what is weird?
Being around men again.

400
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,886
Well, you don't have to spend time
in a convent to feel that.

401
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,306
What do you know
about Dale Cooper?

402
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,350
Are we interested?

403
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,726
Who said anything about that?

404
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,562
Well, judging by the look on his face
when he saw you today,

405
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,898
I'd say you have a major opportunity.

406
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,983
Sorry, you have it all wrong.

407
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,778
I'm not even remotely interested.

408
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,847
Andy?

409
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,974
Yes, Lucy.

410
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:57,104
I wanna thank you for helping out
during the weasel riot yesterday.

411
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,899
Which is more than I can say
for a certain Dick we both know.

412
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,778
Keeping the peace is part of my job.

413
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,699
Where are you going
with all of that gear?

414
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,618
- Spelunking.
- Oh.

415
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,872
Is it dangerous? Spelunking?

416
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,001
Sometimes.

417
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,169
Promise me something?

418
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,463
Okay.

419
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,258
I know you'll be strong,

420
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,386
and I know you'll be brave,

421
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:33,724
but I want you to promise me
that you'll be careful.

422
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,854
I'll be careful. You have my word.

423
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:50,949
Oh... dear.

424
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,497
All set, Harry?

425
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,292
Pete just called in our next move.

426
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,046
- We expose a pawn to his bishop.
- Want me to hold off?

427
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,631
No, Pete knows what he's doing.

428
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,633
If he takes that pawn,
he forfeits the bishop,

429
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,843
thus losing his initial advantage.

430
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,053
How you feeling?

431
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,722
Like someone pounded
a railroad spike through my ear.

432
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,266
Then a descent into a cool
subterranean cave

433
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,353
will be just what the doctor ordered.

434
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,146
Are you sure Cole's up
for the climb?

435
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,940
Gordon's not coming with us.

436
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:26,318
Shelly took him up to Doc Hayward's
to see about his hearing problem.

437
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,154
The old tuning-fork test.

438
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,799
Audrey?

439
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,301
When Jack Kennedy
entered the White House,

440
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,345
he took his brother with him

441
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,723
because he trusted Bobby
to tell him the truth,

442
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,309
even when it wasn't pretty.

443
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:04,022
When the Bay of Pigs went up
in smoke, Bobby was there.

444
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,443
When the Russians moved
their missiles into Fidel's backyard,

445
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:12,489
Bobby was there to help his brother
shoulder through.

446
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,701
Sort of how Jerry's done that
for you?

447
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:21,331
It's the unvarnished truth
that I am looking for.

448
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:25,711
And I believe that you

449
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,008
are the best man for the job.

450
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,259
Me?

451
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,931
Audrey,

452
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:43,061
I know that I haven't been
a very good father.

453
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,984
Oh, heck, who am I kidding?

454
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:55,615
When have I ever been anything
but a sleazy, rapacious heel?

455
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,161
Well, Daddy,
maybe when I was little, but...

456
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:03,040
Exactly. But I've changed.

457
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,710
And I am determined
to be a better person.

458
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:11,882
The kind of father
that you will respect someday.

459
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:20,682
When I think about Laura,

460
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,144
when I think about the mistakes
that I've made,

461
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:31,818
I want to build a life in happiness
for our whole family.

462
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,279
You, me.

463
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,909
Will you help me do that?

464
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,870
Please?

465
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,290
Daddy, I'm your man.

466
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,877
Sensational.

467
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,380
Audrey, pack a bag.
Get out to the airport.

468
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,466
Your plane leaves in an hour.

469
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,009
My plane?

470
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:02,057
Oh, John.
Just the man that I wanna see.

471
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,975
Hi, Ben. Hello, Audrey.

472
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,605
- Daddy, um...
- Audrey, you better get a move on.

473
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,483
One hour. Audrey's on her way
to Seattle tonight.

474
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,486
She's having a breakfast confab
with the environmentalists.

475
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,864
We're going national
with this... pine-weasel thing.

476
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,200
Oh. Great. That's great.

477
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,994
Daddy, I'm not sure I can leave
on such short notice.

478
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,248
Now, here are the particulars.
Time, place, so on.

479
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,668
Audrey, you bring us back
good news.

480
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,755
Good news, heh.

481
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,427
Well, guess I better go.

482
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,980
- Bye.
- Bye.

483
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,649
Travel safely, Audrey.

484
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,070
John.

485
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,784
Ah.

486
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,746
How are you, Ben?

487
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:15,380
I am filled to the brim
with a feeling of goodness.

488
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,843
Like a Christmas tree
all lit up inside.

489
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:26,516
But at the end of the day
when I look in the mirror,

490
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:33,315
I have to face the fact
that I really don't know how to be good.

491
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,066
You're off to a pretty fair start.

492
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,320
How do you do it, John?
What's the secret?

493
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:42,324
Do you really think
that I could learn to be good?

494
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,619
I don't see why not.
Just keep your eye on your heart.

495
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:46,995
And always tell the truth.

496
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:52,375
- Always tell the truth.
- Tell the hardest truth first, though.

497
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:57,088
Oh, always tell the hardest truth first.
Oh, I love that.

498
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,965
John, that's terrific.

499
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:03,970
This truth business,
it's clearly at the forefront of goodness.

500
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,180
Ben?

501
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,681
Hmm?

502
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:10,602
- I'm falling in love with your daughter.
- Yeah, that's a hard truth.

503
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,063
- Good example.
- It is the truth.

504
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,484
- It is?
- Yep.

505
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,406
Oh, John.

506
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,493
- John.
- Ben.

507
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,372
What a wonderful world we live in.

508
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,971
- Come on, Andy.
- Get a good grip, Andy.

509
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,555
- Do it.
- That's it, Andy.

510
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,183
- Looking good.
- Hand over hand.

511
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,352
Almost there. Take it easy.

512
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,770
No, no, no. Don't look down. No.

513
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,647
Hang on, Andy. Don't look down.

514
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,774
- Hang on.
- Don't look down!

515
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,821
- Andy.
- You okay?

516
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,948
I'm fine.

517
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,330
Whew. Incredible.

518
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,792
We used to play here
when I was a kid.

519
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,753
Pretended it was haunted
by fierce ghosts.

520
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,880
Beer drinkers, by the look of it.

521
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,258
Where's the symbol?

522
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,719
This way.

523
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,189
It's right here.

524
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,242
- There it is.
- Whoa.

525
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,620
Wow.

526
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:58,585
Two symbols combined
into a larger whole.

527
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,170
But for what purpose?

528
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,047
I don't know.

529
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,590
Beats me.

530
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,885
The tattoos are the question.

531
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,803
This must be the answer.

532
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,927
It's stuck.

533
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,971
My pick, it's stuck.

534
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,853
Oh, my God.

535
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,624
- Wow.
- Holy smoke.

536
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,505
Look at that.

537
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,471
What have I done?

538
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:40,395
Fellas, coincidence and fate
figure largely in our lives.

539
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,867
It appears to be a petroglyph.

540
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:58,455
Harry, I have no idea
where this will lead us.

541
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:05,170
But I have a definite feeling it will be
a place both wonderful and strange.

542
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,123
Good evening.
Can I help you, young lady?

543
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,628
Yes, I would like something to drink,
but I'm not exactly sure what.

544
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,713
Ladies seem to like the rum.

545
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,257
Rum. I would like to have
a rum, please.

546
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:54,427
- Uh, with?
- Tonic?

547
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,685
Diane, Thursday, 9:05 p.m.

548
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,730
I've just returned from a place
called Owl Cave.

549
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,107
How I got there
is a rather complicated story.

550
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,402
It all began with a pair of tattoos...

551
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,121
First one's on me.

552
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,748
Thank you.

553
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,542
- Hello, Annie.
- Hi.

554
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,461
- Can I get you something...? Oh.
- No, no. I have a rum and tonic.

555
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,796
I see.

556
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,798
One of the sisters
used to put rum in her tea,

557
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,175
and I thought it sounded exotic, so...

558
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,760
This is all new to you, isn't it?

559
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:41,349
I feel constantly amazed, stunned.

560
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,726
Music and people,

561
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,937
the way they talk and laugh,

562
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,022
and the way some of them
are so clearly in love.

563
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,358
It's like a foreign language to me.

564
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,695
I know just enough of the words
to realize how little I understand.

565
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,864
Man, I would love to see the world
through your eyes.

566
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,658
Why?

567
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,579
Oh, there's some things
I might do different if I had the chance.

568
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,747
Me too.

569
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:22,223
You see, the thing is,
I failed before and...

570
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,480
I'm just afraid it might happen again.

571
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,483
You wanna talk about it?

572
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,903
Not yet.

573
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,489
Maybe I can help.

574
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,534
Can you?

575
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,494
If you want me to.

576
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,790
I'm stubborn. Extremely willful.

577
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,250
I can handle that.

578
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,503
Some people think I'm strange.

579
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,088
I know the feeling.

580
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,969
I couldn't promise you
that I would always make sense

581
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,221
or do things
that you would expect me to do.

582
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,140
Annie, I don't expect anything.

583
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,354
Then I accept your kind
and generous offer.

584
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:14,025
Good. I'm glad.

585
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,760
My, my, my.

586
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,763
What have we

587
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,932
here?

588
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,394
Could it be?

589
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,482
Yes.

590
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,903
The symbol inverted.

591
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,119
Now...
