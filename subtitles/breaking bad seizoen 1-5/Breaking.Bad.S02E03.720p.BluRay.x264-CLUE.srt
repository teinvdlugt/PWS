1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,973
Okay. That's okay.

2
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,570
Get that.

3
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,116
Hey.

4
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:48,275
- Oh, God. Please.
- Oh, jeez.

5
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:49,902
Please.

6
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,403
Please.

7
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,580
It's a bold plan, Mr. White.

8
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,582
You sure this is the way to go?

9
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,043
Yeah.

10
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,586
Yeah.

11
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:31,670
You see that?

12
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,828
- What does he remember?
- Not a whole lot.

13
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,872
He came in dehydrated
and disoriented...

14
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,792
...but once we gave him fluids
he stabilised pretty quickly.

15
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,126
But I mean...

16
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,713
- He knows where he is?
- Oh, yes, yes. Absolutely.

17
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,259
It's only the last day or so
that seem to be missing.

18
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,053
Go on in. He's probably awake.

19
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,727
My God.

20
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,980
Walter.

21
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,817
I'm so sorry.

22
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,742
Come here.

23
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,245
You know who I am, right?

24
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,580
Yes, son. I know who you are.

25
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,625
Come here. Give your old man a hug.

26
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,756
It's so good to see you.

27
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,844
How do you feel?

28
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,558
Better.

29
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,602
Yeah. I...

30
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,062
I feel like myself.

31
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,273
Really, I mean, in...

32
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,570
The past couple days are missing,
but other than that...

33
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:20,821
...I feel fine.

34
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,032
My God, Walt.

35
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,620
What a day this has been.

36
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,956
So, Uncle Hank,
he was in a shootout?

37
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,292
A shootout?

38
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,462
He killed some guy.
Some big drug dealer.

39
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,671
Uncle Hank wasted him.

40
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,549
- Oh, my God. Is he all right?
- Absolutely fine.

41
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:44,553
- Where did this happen? How could--?
- Walt, everything's okay.

42
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,182
We're all okay.

43
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,059
We'll be all right.

44
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,895
<i>And no idea what caused it?</i>

45
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,313
No.

46
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,483
But they're gonna run
a whole series of tests, so...

47
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,654
<i>But what could it be? I mean, did they
give you a worst-case scenario?</i>

48
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,989
I really...

49
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,744
You know, there's no point
in getting ahead of ourselves, so...

50
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,454
Well, which supermarket?

51
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:13,707
Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain?

52
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,627
<i>- Marie.
- I... Don't get me wrong.</i>

53
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:21,840
I think it's just great that, you know,
he's back and he's feeling better.

54
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,842
I just, I mean...

55
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:27,680
He... Naked?

56
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,683
He was naked.

57
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,643
Naked.

58
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,436
In a supermarket.

59
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,021
It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

60
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,566
<i>In any case, I'm gonna get over there
as soon as I can.</i>

61
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,820
No, no. Don't worry about it
right now, Marie.

62
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,446
How's Hank?

63
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,199
You know, I ran over here
and I got to see him all of...

64
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,703
...30 seconds
before they yanked him away.

65
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,747
You know, you'd think today
of all days...

66
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,084
...they'd let him go home on time.

67
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,504
But how is he? Really?

68
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,216
Hank?

69
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,597
He's indestructible, you know that.

70
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:15,185
I identified myself and told the suspect
to show his hands, turn and face me.

71
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,063
At this point, I identified
the suspect as Mr. Salamanca...

72
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,567
...and observed what appeared to be
a gunshot wound in his midsection.

73
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,362
- He was shot previous to your arrival?
- Yes, sir.

74
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:29,199
Again I instructed him
to show his hands.

75
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,577
Mr. Salamanca lunged
toward the vehicle...

76
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,331
...and fired on me with what I
ascertained to be an M16 assault rifle.

77
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,583
I returned fire and sought cover...

78
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,836
...as Mr. Salamanca proceeded
to engage me.

79
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,715
When he paused to reload...

80
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,301
...I was able to take
an effective shot.

81
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:50,888
Agent Schrader...

82
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,516
...what were you doing in a shooting
fight on your own, with no backup?

83
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,436
Mr. Salamanca's presence
was not something I'd anticipated.

84
00:07:57,645 --> 00:08:00,230
- I was tending to another matter.
- What other matter?

85
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,362
An unrelated family matter.

86
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,615
Searching for your brother-in-law,
as I understand.

87
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,327
- Your brother-in-law?
- Yes, sir. He's since been found.

88
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,288
He's fine. The whole thing
was a misunderstanding.

89
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,415
At the time, he'd been missing
for hours...

90
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:22,127
...and since he's in poor health,
the whole family was concerned.

91
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,255
I was talking to his acquaintances...

92
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,715
...trying to get a fix
on his whereabouts.

93
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:30,511
The Monte Carlo at the scene
belonged to a former student of his...

94
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,847
...a Jesse Pinkman.

95
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:38,644
I was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car
when I came across Mr. Salamanca.

96
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,106
And what about this Pinkman? What
was his car doing at the crime scene?

97
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:46,026
- Have you run him down yet?
- Not yet, but we're working on it.

98
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,332
Man, they're like
Jehovah's Witnesses.

99
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,959
They don't give up.

100
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,421
I don't get it. Why don't they
kick your door down?

101
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,924
- They need probable cause.
- Probable cause?

102
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:10,926
Yo, what did you do? Rob a bank?

103
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:14,513
I told you, this is serious shit.

104
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,765
I'm like an outlaw.

105
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,142
Okay.

106
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,111
Let's do this.

107
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,541
Holy Christ!

108
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:45,210
You're Willy Wonka.

109
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,172
You are Willy Wonka,
and I got the golden ticket.

110
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,467
Put me on your magical boat, man.

111
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,803
Sail me down
your chocolaty river of meth.

112
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,347
So where you keep the pseudo?

113
00:09:56,555 --> 00:10:00,309
It's a P2P cook. That barrel?
Aqueous methylamine.

114
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:04,188
With that, you don't need pseudo.
Come on, help me out, man.

115
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,148
No pseudo?

116
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:10,569
Come to me, beautiful baby.
I'm gonna be so good to you.

117
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,490
Oh, my God. Just take this, here.

118
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:18,410
But I can't just let you
break this down.

119
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,247
- That'd be sacrilege.
- I told you, that's why we're here.

120
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,082
- You saw the cops. Right?
- Sure.

121
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,626
But couldn't we just
cook one quick batch?

122
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,587
- You know, for the road?
- No, forget it, all right?

123
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:32,633
- This stuff has to go, like, now.
- Dude, you owe me.

124
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,513
I mean, we're cool, but I ain't
forgetting you just left me stranded.

125
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,306
God, Badger!

126
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:44,144
Don't mess with me.

127
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,772
Got it?

128
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,403
Yeah, I got it.

129
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,714
Oh, my God.

130
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,303
Okay, that's all of it.

131
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,180
This was a bad choice.

132
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,354
You sure about this guy?

133
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,732
He's totally, totally cool.

134
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,692
He's my cousin.

135
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:39,325
- Yo, what'd we say, 500?
- We didn't say, and it's 1000.

136
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,909
Thousand bucks?

137
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,787
Come on, where you towing it,
man, Seattle?

138
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:45,789
It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.

139
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,669
Look, I mean, all I got on me is...

140
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,759
...560.

141
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,053
- You know what?
- Hey-- No--

142
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,139
Clovis, he'll pay you the rest later.

143
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:05,851
He's totally good for it.
Jesse's a stand-up dude.

144
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,230
- That right? You a stand-up dude?
- Yeah, I am.

145
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,650
I will get you the other 500.

146
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,026
Five hundred more.

147
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,488
Your word's your bond, right?

148
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,531
Right.

149
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:29,792
I saved your skinny ass, yo.
I totally vouched for you.

150
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,045
What are you doing now, exactly?

151
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,130
I'm giving you, like, two hours...

152
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,801
...and then I'm calling on a pay phone,
not a cell phone.

153
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,552
You're not using your own name.

154
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:45,557
I mean, obviously. Look, dude, I'll do,
like, what you said, but why?

155
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,810
Why do you gotta go and do this?

156
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,688
They need probable cause.

157
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,231
I'm giving it to them.

158
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,496
What's the last thing
you remember?

159
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:12,251
Well, I was driving home.

160
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,086
I think.

161
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:16,714
And...

162
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,174
Do you remember coming home?

163
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:22,511
You came in, and I asked
why you were out of breath?

164
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:29,268
You don't remember talking to me
when I was in the bathtub?

165
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,895
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

166
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:37,443
- Nothing else? No fleeting images?
- Well, no. I...

167
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:39,987
I was--

168
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:46,785
I was walking down some road
or highway...

169
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,164
...with a lot of headlights...

170
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:54,501
...and I remember feeling fear.

171
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,756
- That's it.
- All right. Thank you.

172
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,967
Well, there's definitely
some good news here.

173
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,678
The MRI shows no metastases.

174
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,765
Meaning the cancer
hasn't spread to the brain?

175
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,808
Yeah, we're looking really good.

176
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,769
Oh, thank God.

177
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,689
So, what was it, then?

178
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:19,276
- There's no sign of stroke or seizure.
- And considering your condition...

179
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:21,153
...the blood panel looks good.

180
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,490
Then what are we talking about?
What happened?

181
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,952
As of right now, we really...

182
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,536
...can't say.

183
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,165
Forgive me.
Granted, this is not my field...

184
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:36,001
...but isn't it possible
that this had something to do...

185
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,337
...with all the prescriptions
I've been taking?

186
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,089
There's the antiemetic...

187
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,132
...the antitussive...

188
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,844
...the this, the that.
Not to mention the chemo itself.

189
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:52,393
And being off all of them
for the past few days, I have to say...

190
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,478
...I'm feeling much better.

191
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:57,273
Yeah, and, you know, when we pick up
these medications...

192
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,984
...the information sheets
are as long as your arm.

193
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:04,196
I mean, it's page after page
of side effects and warnings.

194
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:07,616
Right, exactly.
Could it be that simple?

195
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:11,537
Well, we'll take
another look at that, sure.

196
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,623
Walt, I understand that you've been
kind of stressed out lately.

197
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,834
Stressed out? I--

198
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,044
- No, I don't think I'm--
- Walt, please.

199
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,547
Stressed out is putting it...

200
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,007
...mildly.

201
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:30,806
Well, I guess I've had a lot
on my mind lately, but as I've said...

202
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:32,683
...I'm feeling much better.

203
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,561
Shouldn't we be talking
about when I can get out of here?

204
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,689
Well, that may still be
a ways down the road.

205
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,442
A ways down the road?

206
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,821
Actually, I think our next move
is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.

207
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:51,243
Now, is that absolutely necessary?

208
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,787
Nobody likes being in the hospital.
I get that.

209
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,248
But until we know
what caused this incident...

210
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:58,834
...we can't be certain it won't recur.

211
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,798
- That your last hit?
- Yeah.

212
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,300
Finish it quick.

213
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,127
Show your hands.
Get on your stomach now.

214
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:27,339
Get on your stomach now!
Get over. Roll! Do it now!

215
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,389
I'm going, I'm going.

216
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,391
What's going on?

217
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,602
What did I do?

218
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,523
Jesse Pinkman, I presume.

219
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,880
- What, man?
- Tell me again.

220
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,174
Again?

221
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,218
What's there to tell, okay?
Her and I were partying, that's it.

222
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:16,388
Since Saturday night?
Partying for three days straight.

223
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,934
Just bumping uglies and smoking that
crystal you got from your pal, Tuco?

224
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,518
Taco? I don't know any Taco...

225
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,313
...and I damn sure didn't say
anything about no crystal.

226
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,148
Three days,
you must have got hungry.

227
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:27,608
Yeah, I guess.

228
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,110
- You order take-out?
- Yeah.

229
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,321
Yeah, where from?

230
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,157
You get yourself a little
of that moo goo gai pan...

231
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:37,493
...from that chink place
around the corner?

232
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:41,413
No, no, we didn't. We got stuff
from the vending machine.

233
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,249
You know, Funyuns.

234
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,917
I had a Hot Pocket.

235
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,628
Funyuns and Hot Pockets?

236
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,463
You didn't notice your car
was gone?

237
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:52,216
No, not until you guys went
and busted down the door.

238
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,510
Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh?

239
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,762
Management's gonna
be on my ass for sure.

240
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:59,932
- You weren't answering your phone.
- It was in my car.

241
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:02,935
- That right?
- Yeah.

242
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:06,981
We found your car...

243
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,316
...but your phone wasn't in it.

244
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,026
You found my car?

245
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,279
You found my car?

246
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:16,824
Awesome. DEA all the way. Yes.

247
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,621
Since we're talking
about missing property, did you...?

248
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,457
Did you leave anything else
in the car?

249
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,792
Like what?

250
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,421
Like what? Like...

251
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,965
I don't know. Like this?

252
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:46,312
Sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred
and 20 dollars.

253
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,147
That's not mine.

254
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,149
That's not yours?

255
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,152
He says it's not his, Gomie.

256
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,696
Gee, I really thought
this might be yours.

257
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:59,491
- I wish.
- Unclaimed drug money, huh? Nice.

258
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,785
You know what we got here,
Gomie, don't you?

259
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:04,872
That's a new interdiction van
right there, yeah.

260
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:07,583
Definitely new softball jerseys,
because we need them.

261
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,460
Good thing Tuco's already dead.

262
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,087
I lost this kind of money,
I'd wanna kill myself.

263
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,633
So who's your chief, little Injun?

264
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,343
What?

265
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,554
- What does that even mean?
- I think your story's bullshit.

266
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:23,223
I think you know
who Tuco Salamanca was.

267
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,351
Your car was there
because you were there.

268
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:29,855
Tuco had a bullet in him when I
got there and you know about that too.

269
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,942
So, what are you saying?

270
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,069
I shot someone?

271
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:38,739
- With, like, a gun?
- You?

272
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,824
No.

273
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:44,119
Only shooting you do
is into a Kleenex.

274
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,456
But I think you know
the badass who did.

275
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:53,128
Look, I was partying with Wendy,
okay?

276
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:56,590
Funyuns and boom-boom.

277
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,842
No.

278
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,886
I don't think so.

279
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,223
Tell you what. We're gonna...

280
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:08,435
...go talk to that skinny yeast factory
of a girlfriend you got.

281
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:10,312
And you know what?

282
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:16,360
I got a feeling she's gonna, you know,
roll on you.

283
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:21,865
Don't go nowhere.

284
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:39,675
Where's my root beer? Come on.
I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.

285
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:42,928
- I got medical issues.
- Medical issues?

286
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:45,097
Like, what kind of medical issues?

287
00:21:45,306 --> 00:21:46,974
You got penis withdrawal?

288
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,518
You got schlongus interruptus?

289
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,771
Wendy, listen. Talk to me...

290
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,815
...and you get a root beer
and a tinkle.

291
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:56,984
- Tell me the last three days.
- I told you...

292
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,737
...we were shacked up
since Saturday.

293
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:03,157
Neither of you left the room?
Not even for a little, little minute?

294
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,869
Not even for a second?

295
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:11,206
For a second? I don't know, maybe.

296
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,167
Maybe?

297
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,127
Did Jesse leave the room?

298
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:18,047
He did, didn't he?

299
00:22:18,756 --> 00:22:21,634
Wendy, you can do it.
You can do it, Wendy.

300
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:25,095
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

301
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:28,933
You know you wanna go back
to giving windys, Wendy.

302
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:33,103
It's you. I know you.

303
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:36,649
You're the one in the black truck.
You wanted me to do that kid.

304
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:38,609
- What?
- The kid with the crutches.

305
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:41,111
- The football player.
- How about we stay on topic?

306
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,407
Look, Jesse came over to the palace
at 11:00 Saturday night.

307
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:48,410
We were together the whole time,
and he never left the room.

308
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,329
And that's all I'm saying about that.

309
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,122
Now, come on.

310
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:54,500
Where's my root beer?

311
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:00,130
You wanted her to bang
a football player, pervert?

312
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:01,840
It's a long story, Gomie.

313
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:05,552
I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it,
but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.

314
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:08,931
Not yet. I got one more shot
at that little skid mark.

315
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:18,232
And how are you sleeping?

316
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,113
Fine. Most nights.

317
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:25,614
Good.

318
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:28,200
Have you noticed
any recurring thoughts or images...

319
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:30,536
...things you can't
get out of your head?

320
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,210
How about feelings of guilt
or persecution?

321
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:42,214
No. Look, doctor,
I don't mean to be rude...

322
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,384
...but where is this going, exactly?

323
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:48,971
We're starting a process, Walt.
An ongoing process.

324
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,891
- Do you prefer Walt or Walter?
- Ongoing for how long?

325
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,393
I just met you. Hard to say.

326
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:57,605
We could be talking about days,
weeks, months.

327
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:02,901
Look, doctor, I feel fine, really.

328
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,403
Now...

329
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:09,909
...if this is truly necessary,
can't I continue as an outpatient?

330
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:12,745
Walt...

331
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:16,498
...a fugue state
is a very serious event.

332
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:18,834
What if you were to disassociate
while driving?

333
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:20,127
Get into a situation...

334
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:22,254
...where you could be shot
by the police?

335
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:24,131
We can't allow you to leave...

336
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,426
...until we're certain what happened
was a non-recurring event.

337
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:30,387
Saying you feel fine
doesn't solve this.

338
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:39,229
Would you tell me
about patient confidentiality?

339
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:40,606
It's very straightforward.

340
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:44,193
Without your permission,
I can't disclose anything to anyone.

341
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:45,694
What about my family?

342
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:49,239
Not your family, not to the police.
Not to anyone.

343
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:52,076
The exception would be
if you threatened to kill someone.

344
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:55,955
Then I'd be able to tell that person,
but only that person.

345
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,792
And you, as a medical practitioner...

346
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,169
...you abide
by these strictures absolutely.

347
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:03,712
Yes.

348
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,178
All right.

349
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,933
There was no fugue state.

350
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,853
I remember everything.

351
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,527
The truth is...

352
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:30,364
...I couldn't stand to spend
another second in that house.

353
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,993
I just had to get out...

354
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:35,869
...and so I left.

355
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:38,247
I didn't think about it.
I just did it.

356
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:44,837
I walked for a long time, and when I
couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.

357
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:48,507
I got as far as Gallup...

358
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:55,055
...and then it was just time
to come home.

359
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:56,849
So...

360
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:59,893
...being found naked
in a supermarket...

361
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:03,647
...that was your way
of giving credibility to a lie?

362
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:07,067
Of avoiding questions
about your disappearance?

363
00:26:14,742 --> 00:26:16,452
Why run away?

364
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,705
What did you feel
you had to run from?

365
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:27,838
Doctor, my wife
is seven months pregnant...

366
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:30,049
...with a baby we didn't intend.

367
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:34,720
My 15-year-old son
has cerebral palsy.

368
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:39,266
I am an extremely overqualified
high school chemistry teacher.

369
00:26:39,475 --> 00:26:44,271
When I can work,
I make $43,700 per year.

370
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,523
I have watched
all of my colleagues...

371
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:49,109
...and friends surpass me
in every way imaginable...

372
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:53,197
...and within 18 months,
I will be dead.

373
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:57,826
And you ask why I ran?

374
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,487
Gomie, you wanna do the honours?

375
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,748
- What's that mean?
- That means yes.

376
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:48,961
- Yes is a bell, no is no bell.
- Come on, this is bullshit.

377
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,798
I mean, look at this dude. He doesn't
even know what planet he's living on.

378
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:54,466
Señor...

379
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:56,802
...are we on the planet Mars?

380
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:02,474
Are we on the planet Saturn?

381
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,520
Are we on the planet Earth?

382
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:12,318
Señor, is today Friday?

383
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,153
Is today Monday?

384
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:16,906
Is today Tuesday?

385
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:20,242
Okay, seems like he's all there.
Let's go for it.

386
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:23,579
Señor...

387
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:28,000
...was this man
at your house yesterday?

388
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:40,095
Señor, was this man
at your house yesterday?

389
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:50,856
This guy right here,
he was at your house, right?

390
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,317
Was he doing business
with your nephew Tuco?

391
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:59,198
Señor, are you scared of this man?

392
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:03,202
No, he's not scared.

393
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:09,166
Come on, Granddad.

394
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:11,627
Don't you wanna help us out?

395
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:31,063
Oh, man.

396
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,072
I guess that's a no.

397
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:45,077
- I told you, numbnuts. This guy's OG.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

398
00:29:45,286 --> 00:29:47,413
Kept his mouth shut for 17 years
in San Quentin.

399
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:50,666
Stroke or no stroke, old-school
gangbang Mexicans don't help feds.

400
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:54,920
- All right. It was worth a try at least.
- We gotta kick Pinkman loose.

401
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:57,047
It's all right. He's nobody anyway.

402
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:59,341
You telling me you buy
that lame-ass story?

403
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,845
I buy that lame-ass story more than
I buy he had anything to do...

404
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:05,139
...with shooting Tuco, man.

405
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:09,602
Dad? Hey, Dad.

406
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,604
Hey, can you hear me?

407
00:30:12,605 --> 00:30:15,482
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. Hey, I'm...

408
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:17,985
What's--?

409
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:21,155
She did?
No, I didn't get any messages.

410
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,115
You know, I actually...

411
00:30:23,324 --> 00:30:26,076
...lost my phone, and I've been
too busy to get a new one.

412
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:27,494
I've been busy as...

413
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:29,580
As totally productive.

414
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:33,083
Hey, you know what?
I'm actually zeroing in on a job.

415
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:36,587
Yeah, yeah, data entry,
like we talked about.

416
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:39,256
Yeah, I'm totally amped.

417
00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:41,800
Hey, could you give me a ride?

418
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:46,430
I'm actually--
I'm downtown and my car's in the...

419
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:51,226
Oh, no.
Yeah, hey, that's cool. I will--

420
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:55,147
I'll call you later
when you have some...

421
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:57,900
Okay. Yeah. No. I--

422
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:00,736
I get it. I get it.

423
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:03,322
Okay, bye.

424
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,625
Thanks.

425
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,586
So, what are you doing now?

426
00:31:17,795 --> 00:31:19,755
Waffle House?

427
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:23,175
Waffle House is good.

428
00:31:57,876 --> 00:31:58,877
Pay phone?

429
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:01,755
Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere,
nobody followed.

430
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:02,965
So how did it go?

431
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:06,385
Okay. You?

432
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:10,889
They sweated me plenty,
but they finally cut me loose.

433
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:13,434
- So you getting out of there?
- Tomorrow.

434
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:15,644
So who came for you?

435
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:17,605
The DEA? What did they ask you?

436
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:21,275
Yeah, that's the thing, you know.
Your scumbag brother-in-law...

437
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,027
...took my rainy-day fund.

438
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:25,029
<i>Your what? What is that?</i>

439
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:28,490
My rainy-day fund.
Sixty-eight thousand, okay?

440
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:30,618
Cue-ball son of a bitch
laughed in my face.

441
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:32,745
Now I got like 80 bucks
to my name.

442
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:34,330
Wait, wait. What does he know?

443
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:36,123
Does he know it's your money?

444
00:32:36,332 --> 00:32:38,834
No, man.
He doesn't know shit, okay?

445
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:40,586
The plan worked.

446
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:42,004
They bought it.

447
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:44,673
I got bills due, man. I'm screwed.

448
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:49,011
<i>- Did he mention my name?
- No. Thanks for caring.</i>

449
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:54,099
- What about the basement?
- It's clean.

450
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,268
<i>And the RV?</i>

451
00:32:56,477 --> 00:33:00,314
Badger's cousin took it to his garage.
It's safe.

452
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:02,858
Can he get it running again?

453
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:06,695
<i>- Why?
- So we can cook.</i>

454
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:09,657
So you still wanna cook?

455
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:11,325
Seriously?

456
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:15,287
What's changed, Jesse?

457
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:27,299
Seven-hundred
thirty-seven thousand.

458
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,468
Twenty-one pounds...

459
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:32,012
...minus cash on hand...

460
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:33,973
Cash on hand.

461
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:14,133
- Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?
- No, I was awake.

462
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:19,471
- Want some cornflakes?
- Yeah, sure.

463
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,896
- You okay?
- Yeah.

464
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,478
Southwest Aniline again?

465
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:33,939
What's this?

466
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:36,483
It's the blue meth we found
up by your late homey.

467
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:40,154
Tuco wasn't my homey, any more
than Charlie Manson was yours.

468
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:42,698
Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style.

469
00:38:43,324 --> 00:38:45,242
P2P, huh?

470
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:46,994
So, what are you thinking?

471
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:49,079
The two stooges over here
cooked it?

472
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:53,250
Lab said that blue meth's
the purest they've seen.

473
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:54,960
At least since this.

474
00:38:55,461 --> 00:38:57,796
- Krazy-8.
- Yeah.

475
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:02,009
Krazy-8, Tuco...

476
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:05,930
Somehow, some way,
it's all connected.

477
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:08,974
A simple explanation...

478
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:11,727
...only I'm not seeing it,
and it's making my head hurt.

479
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:14,480
That's because you're working
that ugly melon too hard.

480
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,982
It's dead around here.
Let's get a couple of beers.

481
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,109
It's 11 in the morning.

482
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:20,319
I'm buying.

483
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:21,779
You're buying? Holy crap.

484
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:24,823
- What, is it Cinco de Mayo already?
- Oh, yeah.

485
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:30,663
Surprise.

486
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:34,583
You little sneaky bastard, you.

487
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,418
Very nice work.

488
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:38,671
Thank you, sir.

489
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,259
- What's this?
- Look what we got you.

490
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:46,595
- Look at that, I love it.
- They got the gut right.

491
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:48,847
- Hey.
- There you go.

492
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:50,683
- Hey, thanks, man.
- Thank you.

493
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:56,689
We all got you a little something,
and this is from all of us.

494
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:58,857
You shouldn't have.

495
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:03,195
Oh, you sick, sick puppies.

496
00:40:03,404 --> 00:40:05,114
I love it.

497
00:40:10,286 --> 00:40:12,204
You going to finish
your apple juice?

498
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:15,207
No, thanks, buddy. You take it.

499
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:18,794
You're supposed to drink it.

500
00:40:19,003 --> 00:40:22,423
The nurse said
you have to stay hydrated.

501
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:24,675
But I'm not thirsty.

502
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:28,137
Dad. Drink it.

503
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:41,066
Hey.

504
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,027
Better late than never, huh?

505
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:45,154
- Hey.
- Hey.

506
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,990
How you doing, buddy?
You all right?

507
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:50,242
I see
the mark of the beast there, huh?

508
00:40:50,451 --> 00:40:52,620
Oh, yeah.
Marie stopped by this morning.

509
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:55,706
They really cheer the place up.

510
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:59,919
Hey, I ran into Sky downstairs.

511
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:03,589
They're rounding up a wheelchair
for you, you freeloading bastard.

512
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:06,884
So tell us about the shootout.

513
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:10,429
I was, you know, just doing my job.

514
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:13,098
Whole thing was over
in about five seconds.

515
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:15,225
Say, Walt, you know...

516
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:18,145
...how are you?

517
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:20,105
I'm okay.

518
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:22,900
Really, I'm feeling fine.

519
00:41:23,234 --> 00:41:25,402
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

520
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:28,447
The doctor is calling it a...

521
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:32,701
An isolated episode of
transient global amnesia.

522
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,453
Damn.

523
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:36,288
Which means non-recurring.

524
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:38,666
Non-recurring.
That sounds good, yeah.

525
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:40,292
Sounds real good.

526
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:44,129
I'll tell you what, I'm glad you're back.
You really gave us a scare.

527
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:47,174
Listen, Hank.

528
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:49,718
I don't know what to say. I mean...

529
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:55,849
...you going out there looking for me
put you in danger, and I'm so...

530
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:59,728
Sorry, sorry doesn't
even cut it. Not nearly.

531
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:02,523
No, no, no. Is that what you're
worried about? Forget it.

532
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:06,151
Look, the office, they're treating me
like I'm Eliot Ness, okay?

533
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,655
They threw me a party, the gals
baked me a chocolate-chip cake...

534
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:11,865
...like you wouldn't believe, okay?

535
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:15,244
You ought to disappear more often.

536
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:17,830
Just kidding. Don't do that.

537
00:42:18,581 --> 00:42:20,708
Hey, look.
Look what they gave me.

538
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,501
Look what they gave me.

539
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,961
What is it?

540
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:28,632
That, gentlemen,
is the grill of the guy I shot.

541
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:31,051
- His grill?
- Yeah.

542
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,846
It kind of goes over the front teeth
like that, you know?

543
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:36,348
Sort of a fashion statement, I guess.

544
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:39,184
You know, certain folks
are attracted to shiny things.

545
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:41,186
Wow, cool.

546
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:42,396
Yeah.

547
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:11,175
I can't tell you how good it feels
to be home.

548
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:20,309
I'll get these in the wash.

549
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:21,852
Okay.

550
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:00,641
Say, honey, I...

551
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:05,813
I was just thinking about going out
to 7-Eleven. Do you need anything?

552
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:15,531
Big Gulp? Slim Jim?

553
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:29,712
Skyler, listen to me.

554
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:35,301
This will not happen again, okay?

555
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:36,635
I won't let it.

556
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:40,347
I'm still here. I'm me...

557
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:43,934
...and we're gonna be okay.

558
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:51,525
Walt...

559
00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:56,363
...do you have a second cell phone?

560
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,201
A second cell phone?

561
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,623
The night you disappeared, you came
in when I was taking a bath...

562
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:07,917
...and you were very upset.

563
00:45:08,751 --> 00:45:11,670
It was like something
terrible had happened.

564
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:14,715
And then your cell phone rang.

565
00:45:14,924 --> 00:45:18,177
I saw you check the number,
and then you got up...

566
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:20,846
...and just disappeared.

567
00:45:22,598 --> 00:45:24,058
Yeah.

568
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:26,560
And when Hank
checked your phone records...

569
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:29,772
...there was no call.

570
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,692
No call on the phone I know about.

571
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:40,199
That is...

572
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:42,117
...odd.

573
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:45,287
I mean, I don't remember
any of that...

574
00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:50,459
...but one thing I am sure of is that
I don't have a second cell phone.

575
00:45:53,212 --> 00:45:54,755
Okay.
