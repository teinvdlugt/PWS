1
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:52,367
Hey, Captain America.

2
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:57,705
- What's up, brother?
- Hey, bro.

3
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,974
This is stupid.

4
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:21,062
- You got a better idea?
- Okay, fun. Whatever.

5
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:24,399
- So when do we, you know?
- We don't, for now.

6
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:26,818
No cooking until things settle down.

7
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:30,905
Settle down? I thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

8
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:33,241
Look, I just put my family
through an ordeal...

9
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:37,912
...that they're just now
starting to accept, okay? I can't--

10
00:02:39,706 --> 00:02:40,707
That's too expensive.

11
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:52,760
Look, I can't leave my house...

12
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:55,346
...for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

13
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,390
I need time to mend fences.

14
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,436
Okay, so while you're fixing fences,
what about me, huh?

15
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:05,273
Your A-hole brother-in-law
took all my money.

16
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:18,203
That's $600.

17
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:19,787
Okay, what about the rest?

18
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:24,459
- Rest of what?
- Half your money's mine.

19
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,878
Fifty-fifty partners.
That's our business motto.

20
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:30,256
Meaning what, exactly?
That I suffer for your carelessness?

21
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:32,425
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

22
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:35,512
Okay. If it weren't for that,
none of this would've happened.

23
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:45,146
Just be cool.
We'll talk about this later, okay?

24
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:49,067
As for now, no contact. Understood?

25
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:52,654
Where are you going?

26
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:55,657
I leave first.

27
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:16,928
- Walt!
- In the kitchen.

28
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,611
Hey.

29
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:37,949
Hey. I didn't know
you were allowed to touch the stove.

30
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:41,452
Hilarious, Groucho.
Go on, grab a seat.

31
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:43,204
Juice is on the table.

32
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,751
What?

33
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,756
- Good morning, honey.
- Hey, Mom.

34
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:56,509
Dad's cooking breakfast.

35
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:59,554
But don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.

36
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:04,017
Nice? Follow me.

37
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:07,228
There's also orange juice
and grapefruit juice...

38
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:10,398
...which, personally, as you know,
I've never been a fan of.

39
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:14,736
But considering all the polyphenols
and the limonoids, can't hurt.

40
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:18,740
Walt, you didn't have to do this.

41
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:22,285
I wanted to.

42
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:27,457
- Grapefruit juice?
- Yes, please. Thanks.

43
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,211
There you go. Honey?

44
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:33,755
No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.

45
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:39,469
All right. Dig in, dig in.
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

46
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:41,221
- Yeah.
- There you go.

47
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:43,932
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

48
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,101
- No.
- Yes, absolutely.

49
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,896
No, in terms of pure musicianship...

50
00:05:50,104 --> 00:05:52,941
...I would put them up against
any current band you can name.

51
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:55,693
You wouldn't know
any current bands.

52
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:59,030
- That's besides the point.
- Have a good day, honey.

53
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,782
You too.

54
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:05,286
- Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
- Boz Scaggs.

55
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:08,998
Whoever they are.
Bye. Thanks for breakfast.

56
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:10,208
- Bye.
- You're welcome.

57
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,001
Tell Louis to drive carefully.

58
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,628
All right.

59
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,926
Our son doesn't know
who Boz Scaggs is.

60
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:22,387
We have failed as parents.

61
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:24,097
Come to think of it...

62
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:26,933
- ...I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.
- Stop it.

63
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:30,311
Give me your plate.
No, no. I'll get it. I'll get it. Yeah.

64
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,938
Thank you.

65
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:35,567
Hey, listen...

66
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,986
...in the calendar section...

67
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,655
...all week long...

68
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:45,201
...there's a fiction writer's seminar
at UNM.

69
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,788
And, you know, probably talking
about how to get published...

70
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:51,499
- ...and that sort of thing.
- Yeah?

71
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:57,547
Yeah, so, anyway,
I thought maybe you might...

72
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:00,592
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.

73
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:14,147
Oh, and...

74
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:18,276
...you know, I was thinking about
what you asked me the other night.

75
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:20,820
You were wondering
if I had a second cell phone.

76
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,531
And, well, I've been
thinking about that a lot...

77
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,870
...and I think what you heard
was my cell phone alarm going off.

78
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:35,543
I've been using it a lot
as a medication reminder...

79
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:38,880
...to, well, remind me
to take my medication.

80
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,051
And, well, the weird thing is that...

81
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,055
...the alarm sound
is almost exactly the same...

82
00:07:47,263 --> 00:07:50,391
...as the regular phone ring
which is really a poor design...

83
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,229
...if you ask me.
But I think that was probably it.

84
00:07:54,437 --> 00:07:57,565
I tried to go in
and change it to a different sound...

85
00:07:57,774 --> 00:08:00,068
...other than the phone ring, but...

86
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:03,446
They so overcomplicate
these things.

87
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:09,077
Anyway, it was probably
just as well that I lost it.

88
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:12,455
There's gotta be a new one
on the market by now.

89
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:16,501
You know, if we do this thing
at UNM, maybe on the way home...

90
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,754
...we can stop by,
and I can get a new cell phone.

91
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:24,801
Skyler?

92
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:38,106
Skyler?

93
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:31,117
- Ready?
- Yo, for what, might help.

94
00:09:40,168 --> 00:09:42,837
Not another intervention.

95
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:54,140
Jesse Bruce Pinkman...

96
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:57,185
...pursuant to Section 47-8-13...

97
00:09:57,393 --> 00:09:59,354
...of the New Mexico
Real Property Code...

98
00:09:59,562 --> 00:10:01,481
...you are hereby
given notice to vacate...

99
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:06,236
...the premises listed as 9809 Margo,
Albuquerque, 87104.

100
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:09,697
Wait. What? You're kicking me
out of my own house?

101
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:12,325
- It's your aunt Ginny's house.
- And she gave it to me.

102
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:14,035
She never gave it to you, Jesse.

103
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:16,996
You were allowed
residentiary privileges.

104
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:20,458
Your parents have always
been the property owners.

105
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:24,379
Look, we talked about this, okay?
I'd sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.

106
00:10:24,587 --> 00:10:27,006
That was the deal.
What the hell happened?

107
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:29,884
What happened is
you're a speed manufacturer.

108
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:32,387
No, I'm not. What?

109
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:36,182
A DEA agent came
looking for you, Jesse.

110
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,685
He came to our front door.

111
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:45,733
Okay, because I've actually
been helping them...

112
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:49,737
...which I could get into
a lot of trouble for telling you...

113
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:51,906
...so you're welcome.

114
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:54,284
I saw your basement.

115
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:56,411
Oh, yeah.

116
00:10:56,619 --> 00:11:00,498
I was worried, so I went
over there and I let myself in...

117
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:05,086
...and I found your laboratory.

118
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:10,091
You guys have your own key?

119
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:20,059
Manufacture of a Schedule ll
controlled substance...

120
00:11:20,852 --> 00:11:23,021
...is a second degree felony.

121
00:11:23,688 --> 00:11:26,483
Under federal asset seizure...

122
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:29,861
...the government can take
the entire house.

123
00:11:30,153 --> 00:11:33,740
It's not even there anymore.
I cleaned it all out.

124
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:36,451
Son, we can't stop you
from ruining your life...

125
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:40,079
...but you will not drag us down
with you.

126
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:43,249
Vacate the house in 72 hours.

127
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,460
Otherwise,
your parents have authorised me...

128
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:49,088
...to contact the authorities.
Is that clear?

129
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,884
Do you have any questions for us?

130
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:57,972
Three days, Mr. Pinkman.

131
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:01,351
Come on.

132
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:43,601
- Hi.
- Hey.

133
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:55,196
- I fixed the garage door.
- Great.

134
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:56,823
Yeah.

135
00:12:57,031 --> 00:12:59,701
One track was bent.
That's why it was bouncing.

136
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:01,452
Okay.

137
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:06,374
- Where were you today?
- Out.

138
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,097
Is everything okay?

139
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:25,101
Yeah, everything's fine.

140
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:44,245
Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking
about going back to those meetings...

141
00:13:44,454 --> 00:13:46,331
...the cancer support group.

142
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:48,374
I think that that's good.

143
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:51,252
Yeah.

144
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:54,380
Yeah, that's good.

145
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,550
You were right
on the money about that.

146
00:13:58,051 --> 00:14:00,053
It's good to, you know...

147
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:03,014
...talk about things.

148
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:05,642
I think that's great.

149
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:11,356
Yeah.

150
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:39,717
Jesse.

151
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,806
Jesse. Hey, Jesse.

152
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:47,517
You don't answer your phone?

153
00:14:49,102 --> 00:14:51,104
Yeah, no, I've just been...

154
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:53,940
...pretty busy. How'd you--?

155
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:57,902
Oh, right, you have that key.

156
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:00,446
Hey, listen.

157
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:03,867
So I've been thinking
a lot about our conversation...

158
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:08,496
...we had the other day,
and I completely get why...

159
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:12,041
...Dad totally tweaked off on me
like that and...

160
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,962
- It's not just your father, Jesse.
- No, I know. I know. I know.

161
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:21,384
I'm just saying it was a really,
really big wake-up call for me...

162
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:24,554
...which is why I wanted to talk
to you. You know, I've been...

163
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:28,183
...thinking real seriously
about business school, actually.

164
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:30,852
You can do the whole thing
from your computer now...

165
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,564
No, Mom, Mom.
Hey, hey, this is good.

166
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:38,526
You know, we're talking,
starting a dialogue.

167
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:42,071
The time for talking
has passed, Jesse.

168
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:45,492
Hey. Hey.

169
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,076
What the hell, yo?

170
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:50,455
- I thought it was just a wake-up call.
- We are putting it in storage.

171
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:52,874
When you decide to grow up,
you can have it back.

172
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:55,376
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

173
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:58,713
Ginny wanted me here.
I was the one who took care of her.

174
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:02,217
I took her to her appointments
and made her lunch every day.

175
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:03,676
I earned this.

176
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:06,221
You did not make
her lunch every day.

177
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:08,181
What did you do, huh?

178
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:11,059
She's lying there dying,
and where the hell are you?

179
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:13,561
- Don't start with me.
- Now what?

180
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,065
You've decided to, I don't know,
make your eldest son homeless?

181
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:20,527
Great family, Mom.

182
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:24,656
Why are you like this? Why?

183
00:16:33,915 --> 00:16:39,170
You have two sets of keys
and the padlock to the garage.

184
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:42,215
Leave them on the kitchen counter
when you leave.

185
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:43,800
No, Mom, Mom, Mom.

186
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:47,095
Hey, where am I supposed to go?

187
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:50,598
I don't know, sweetheart.

188
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:57,105
But please turn your life around.

189
00:16:58,106 --> 00:17:02,443
Yeah, this is gonna help
bigtime with that. Bitch!

190
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:06,573
Jeez.

191
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:20,128
Oh, hey, Mr. White.

192
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:23,089
Hey, well, that's the way.
Don't just sit out there honking.

193
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:24,632
Come in and say hello.

194
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:27,719
Hey, we've got omelettes.
You want an omelette?

195
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:28,970
No, I'm good.

196
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:32,140
New Mexican Christmas style,
red and green chillies.

197
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:34,225
No. Thank you, though.

198
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:36,144
Flynn and me gotta get going.

199
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:40,148
- Who's Flynn?
- Flynn.

200
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:42,317
He's your...

201
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:48,364
- Flynn?
- Yeah.

202
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:50,158
So?

203
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:53,244
So? Nothing.

204
00:17:53,828 --> 00:17:56,080
- You ready?
- Like it.

205
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:57,999
- Bye, Mr. White.
- Okay.

206
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:01,377
Bye.

207
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,721
Flynn? You know about this
Flynn thing?

208
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:19,771
Okay. Flynn. Yeah.
As in what, Errol?

209
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:23,233
I don't know. It's what he likes
to be called these days.

210
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:25,318
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?

211
00:18:25,527 --> 00:18:27,529
Don't take it personally.

212
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:30,698
He wants his own identity.

213
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:38,790
You think he told Louis about me?

214
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:42,460
- About the blackout?
- Louis is his friend, Walt...

215
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:45,255
...and your disappearance
upset him.

216
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:52,762
Hey, I made omelettes.

217
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:55,515
I'm going out, but thanks, though.

218
00:18:55,723 --> 00:18:57,267
Where you going?

219
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:00,854
Can you get the phone, please?

220
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:05,733
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

221
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:13,908
<i>- White residence.
- Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?</i>

222
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:18,288
What part of "no contact"
didn't you understand?

223
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:21,624
<i>- I know, but there's a problem.
- I don't care. We agreed.</i>

224
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,919
No amount of pay-per-view channels
is gonna make any difference.

225
00:19:25,128 --> 00:19:27,422
Honey, we're happy
with our cable provider, right?

226
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:31,509
Yeah, we're happy.

227
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:35,597
Skyler? Sky?

228
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:41,936
Where are you going?
Can you at least tell me that?

229
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:43,563
Out.

230
00:19:44,814 --> 00:19:48,651
Should probably get that, Walt.
I'll be back in a few hours.

231
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,862
Skyler.

232
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,370
- What?
- Yo, I get I shouldn't call...

233
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:02,040
...but I'm in a situation here,
and I need my money.

234
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:03,958
I just gave you $600.

235
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:05,460
And thanks, Daddy Warbucks...

236
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:07,754
...but that was
before my housing situation...

237
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:10,089
...went completely
testicular on me, okay?

238
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:12,300
<i>You smoked the entire 600,
didn't you?</i>

239
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:13,802
<i>- What? No.
- Yes.</i>

240
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,094
<i>- No.
- Look, Jesse...</i>

241
00:20:15,303 --> 00:20:16,846
<i>...your problems are just that.:</i>

242
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:18,723
Your problems.

243
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:21,643
No contact. Do not call here ever.

244
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:25,730
<i>- When the moment is right, I will call.
- Mr. White, you're not listening.</i>

245
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:28,149
They're kicking me out of my house.

246
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:41,329
You son of a bitch.

247
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:48,044
Son of a bitch.

248
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:52,006
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.

249
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:55,176
Thanks, man. Hey, guy!
You forgot something! Yeah!

250
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:59,013
You forgot your ice trays!
You're gonna need the ice trays!

251
00:20:59,222 --> 00:21:02,600
Hey, you forgot something here!
Take this!

252
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:44,476
Hold on, buddy.

253
00:21:44,684 --> 00:21:47,896
Yo, we should get Twaughthammer
up and running again, yo. I'm serious.

254
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:50,231
I know. That sounded tight.

255
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,275
Hey, thanks again, P.

256
00:21:52,484 --> 00:21:56,488
I made sure this stucknut exterminator,
you know, put me on his speed dial.

257
00:21:56,696 --> 00:21:57,822
Two nights tops.

258
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:00,450
No, you still staying
at your aunt's on Margo?

259
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:03,161
Yeah. I'm thinking of moving.
Nob Hill, probably.

260
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:06,706
Jess-a-matic. Living the dream.

261
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah.

262
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:12,378
Okay, buddy. You're gonna eat your
carrots like we talked about, right?

263
00:22:12,587 --> 00:22:13,588
Too hot.

264
00:22:13,797 --> 00:22:16,841
No, no, buddy. Remember. Okay?
Come on, yes.

265
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,468
Listen, hey, talk to me, man.

266
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:21,179
Are you still having
mad relations out there?

267
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:23,515
You can talk to me.
I won't hate a player.

268
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:28,520
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic
out there, female-wise.

269
00:22:29,646 --> 00:22:31,940
Damn. I'm hating, man.

270
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:35,068
That's why we need to get the Hammer
up and running, you know?

271
00:22:35,276 --> 00:22:38,863
- Get you out of the house.
- How awesome would that be?

272
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:40,740
Come on. Look. What?

273
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:44,452
I cut all the green parts off like you--
Just eat them. Please?

274
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:48,248
We should do this. Track down
Cheevo and Anthony and demo up.

275
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:49,582
Get back in the scene.

276
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,627
I'm sorry, man.
Just hold on one second, all right?

277
00:22:52,836 --> 00:22:55,922
Okay, listen. How about
you take a bite of your sandwich...

278
00:22:56,131 --> 00:22:57,799
...and then you take--

279
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,593
Mommy's home.

280
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:03,680
- Hi.
- Hello.

281
00:23:03,888 --> 00:23:06,307
Hey, honey, you remember
Jesse Pinkman?

282
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:10,311
His house is getting bug bombed.
I said he could crash a few nights.

283
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,438
- Hey, Jesse.
- Hey.

284
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:15,150
Paul, could you help me
in the bedroom with these?

285
00:23:17,068 --> 00:23:19,737
Sure. Yeah.

286
00:23:41,468 --> 00:23:43,344
Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too.

287
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:51,394
Hey, Hen, I think
it's someone's nap time. Come on.

288
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,157
Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.

289
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:08,995
I totally spaced that the in-laws
are crashing this weekend.

290
00:24:09,204 --> 00:24:10,622
You got other people to call?

291
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,208
No, that's cool.
I got tons of people. Yeah.

292
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,543
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

293
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:19,214
Yo, in-laws?

294
00:24:19,422 --> 00:24:23,218
- Sucks to be you, P.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know, huh?

295
00:24:24,302 --> 00:24:25,929
Here.

296
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:27,555
See you, man.

297
00:24:27,764 --> 00:24:29,766
It's good to see you.

298
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:35,063
Look, I'm asking to crash three,
maybe four nights, and--

299
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:38,233
Look, I already called Badger,
all right? I called everyone.

300
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:40,902
I need a solid here, bro.

301
00:24:41,986 --> 00:24:43,571
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

302
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:48,743
All right. All right.
Hey, how about this?

303
00:24:49,244 --> 00:24:51,663
What if it's just for tonight?

304
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:12,433
Wait. No, you cannot be serious.

305
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:15,728
- You cannot be serious.
- Hey.

306
00:25:16,688 --> 00:25:19,107
Someone took your bike, man.

307
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:21,317
Not cool.

308
00:28:34,928 --> 00:28:38,306
- Morning.
- Oh, hey.

309
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:39,891
Morning.

310
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,228
Where did--? Where did Mom go?

311
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:46,731
Out.

312
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:55,198
Where's breakfast?

313
00:28:59,202 --> 00:29:00,495
Hey.

314
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:03,540
Let's go do something.

315
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:06,417
Like what?

316
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:09,462
Something fun.

317
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:14,259
All right, ready? Let's put it in gear.

318
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:18,513
- Is your foot on the-- Okay. Good.
- Yeah. I got it.

319
00:29:21,724 --> 00:29:22,892
Good.

320
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:26,729
Yes. Nice and smooth. Good.
Just like that.

321
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:30,525
Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2.
Very nice.

322
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:33,027
Okay, let's slow down here...

323
00:29:33,236 --> 00:29:36,364
...to a stop in preparation
for a left-hand turn. Okay.

324
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:39,492
All right. You might wanna
go easier on the brake.

325
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:42,412
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right. You're doing fine.

326
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,541
- Much better than last time, huh?
- Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.

327
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:49,043
Has he?

328
00:29:49,252 --> 00:29:51,588
Good. Good. Okay.

329
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:53,840
Don't forget the turn indic-- Good.

330
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,468
I'll stop talking.
You know what you're doing.

331
00:29:56,676 --> 00:29:59,512
And let's make that left-hand turn.

332
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:03,433
Nice and smooth. Very nice.

333
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:06,269
Right hand.

334
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,314
Good. Good. Okay.

335
00:30:13,401 --> 00:30:15,778
- Are you using both feet?
- Yeah.

336
00:30:15,987 --> 00:30:18,156
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
You can't do that.

337
00:30:18,364 --> 00:30:20,492
You can't use one foot
on each pedal.

338
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,411
- Why not?
- Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.

339
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:28,374
- Just stop, please. Right. All right.
- Dad, this is way easier.

340
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:31,795
There's the easy way,
and then there's the right way, right?

341
00:30:32,003 --> 00:30:35,089
So let's just try it again,
right foot only.

342
00:30:35,298 --> 00:30:37,008
- All right.
- Okay?

343
00:30:41,596 --> 00:30:45,016
Okay, just-- You don't have to--
Okay. All right. That's fine.

344
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:48,102
Just-- That's okay. That's okay.
Just try it again.

345
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:52,106
Here we go.
Let's just, just try it again.

346
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:54,567
Okay.

347
00:30:54,776 --> 00:30:58,154
Don't-- Just easy.
Okay, okay, good. Great.

348
00:30:58,363 --> 00:31:00,865
That was better. See?
Right? Better? Right.

349
00:31:01,074 --> 00:31:02,784
The gas, the brake,
the gas, the brake.

350
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,452
I can't do this.

351
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,830
My legs don't work that way.

352
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:09,874
Your legs are fine.
You just have to stick with it.

353
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:13,002
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.
You're all right.

354
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:16,631
All right. We'll get this. I promise.
Now let's just try again. All right?

355
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,008
- All right.
- Here we go. Here we go.

356
00:31:21,136 --> 00:31:24,097
Okay, well, you don't need to,
you know, just take off.

357
00:31:24,305 --> 00:31:27,058
But all right, here we go.
Slow it down just a little bit.

358
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:31,938
All right, we have a turn coming up
here, so prepare to apply the brakes.

359
00:31:32,147 --> 00:31:34,482
Prepare, Walt, for the brakes.
Brakes, the brakes.

360
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:36,484
- Braking.
- You're using both feet again.

361
00:31:36,693 --> 00:31:38,987
- It's not stopping.
- That's the gas. Use the brake.

362
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:40,989
The break. Brake, brake, brake!

363
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,495
Okay.

364
00:31:48,121 --> 00:31:49,914
That's one way to stop.

365
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:52,667
I told you.

366
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:54,335
Flynn.

367
00:33:04,697 --> 00:33:06,407
- Hands up, asshole!
- Yo, yo, it's cool.

368
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:08,243
So help me, I will spread you.

369
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:11,538
No, please, no, all right?
It's me, okay? It's Jesse.

370
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:14,582
All right? Look, this is my RV.

371
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:17,418
You towed it.
Your cousin Badger, remember?

372
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:19,546
What the hell you doing here?

373
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:23,758
- You smell like shit.
- It's a long story.

374
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:26,469
So I fixed up your felonious
rolling laboratory here...

375
00:33:26,678 --> 00:33:27,887
...750 for the repair.

376
00:33:28,096 --> 00:33:31,307
Make it a grand, counting the toilet
plus the 500 you already owe me...

377
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:36,271
...and you're good to drive on out of
here to someplace far away. Upwind.

378
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:37,897
Okay.

379
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,191
Here's the thing.

380
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,776
I can't pay you today.

381
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:44,362
But I can pay you this week,
all right?

382
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:50,577
Seventeen fifty? We'll make it 1750,
for, like, you know, interest.

383
00:33:50,785 --> 00:33:53,705
- I thought your word was your bond.
- It totally is.

384
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:57,542
Definitely. I just don't have
the money at this particular moment.

385
00:33:57,792 --> 00:34:01,087
But I will, soon.

386
00:34:01,546 --> 00:34:03,506
Here's my counteroffer.

387
00:34:03,715 --> 00:34:06,843
I kick you out.
I take payment from your inventory.

388
00:34:07,051 --> 00:34:09,679
I know a guy that'll pay
premium for this kind of crap.

389
00:34:09,888 --> 00:34:13,391
All right. Two grand. Okay?

390
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,145
Two days, two grand.
That's totally fair.

391
00:34:17,353 --> 00:34:21,816
Just don't take my cook stuff.
All right? That's all I got left.

392
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:24,360
Please, all right? I really...

393
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:30,366
God, I really need a break here.
Okay?

394
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,330
Clovis, come on.

395
00:34:54,307 --> 00:34:57,477
I don't know.
There's a bunch of stuff in there.

396
00:34:57,685 --> 00:35:00,396
There's something called
methylamine. Me-- Meth...

397
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:03,024
However the hell you pronounce it.
Methylamine.

398
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:06,486
I don't know. I banged on it.
It sounds pretty full to me.

399
00:35:13,368 --> 00:35:15,537
Holy shit. How much?

400
00:35:22,544 --> 00:35:23,878
Hey! Hey!

401
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:00,248
Skyler.

402
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:09,090
Louis took Walt to school.

403
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:13,178
I was thinking maybe...

404
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:15,847
...this would be a good time to talk.

405
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:42,791
I dreamt that I owned
an antique bicycle repair shop.

406
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:46,377
In Ireland.

407
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:51,090
Weird.

408
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,303
Sounds weird.

409
00:37:08,775 --> 00:37:11,236
I wanted to apologise...

410
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:13,446
...for everything.

411
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,783
My...

412
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:20,328
...desire for privacy.

413
00:37:22,455 --> 00:37:24,165
My emotional...

414
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:26,751
...unavailability.

415
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:31,464
Having cancer
doesn't excuse all that.

416
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:35,969
I haven't been
a good partner to you...

417
00:37:36,845 --> 00:37:39,848
...and for that...

418
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:42,600
...I'm very sorry.

419
00:37:44,978 --> 00:37:46,521
I love you.

420
00:37:48,356 --> 00:37:50,275
And I love this family.

421
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:53,695
And I just...

422
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:56,072
...want to make sure that...

423
00:37:57,073 --> 00:37:59,200
...we don't lose contact.

424
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:08,668
Thank you.

425
00:38:09,169 --> 00:38:10,545
Okay.

426
00:38:15,842 --> 00:38:17,302
I agree.

427
00:38:32,942 --> 00:38:34,402
Is that it?

428
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,030
God.

429
00:38:37,238 --> 00:38:39,407
God, how long are
you gonna do this?

430
00:38:39,991 --> 00:38:42,160
- Do what?
- This.

431
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:44,162
Not talking to me.

432
00:38:44,746 --> 00:38:47,874
Going out all day
and refusing to tell me where.

433
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:50,335
You are obviously angry with me
about something...

434
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:52,670
...so let's talk about it.

435
00:39:01,262 --> 00:39:02,639
Oh, God.

436
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:07,894
I feel like you're upset with me
because you think...

437
00:39:08,102 --> 00:39:11,397
...that I'm up to something.

438
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:16,528
- Like what?
- I have no idea, Skyler.

439
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,948
What, that I'm having an affair?
Is that it? Is that what you think?

440
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:22,200
Is that why you asked me
about the...

441
00:39:22,408 --> 00:39:25,787
Some other phone? Because you think
that I'm being unfaithful?

442
00:39:27,914 --> 00:39:29,833
- I don't know.
- Okay.

443
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,918
So ask me.

444
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:34,879
Why?

445
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:38,424
- Would you even tell me?
- Yes. I would.

446
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:40,468
Of course, I would.

447
00:39:40,677 --> 00:39:45,932
And no. I'm not.
I'm not having an affair, okay?

448
00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:48,810
Now, what do I do
to prove that to you?

449
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:52,480
Swear an oath? My right hand
to God. I'm not having an affair.

450
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:54,482
I heard you, Walt.

451
00:39:54,899 --> 00:39:56,818
You're not having an affair.

452
00:39:57,402 --> 00:39:58,653
Congratulations.

453
00:39:58,862 --> 00:40:01,281
No, you know what?
Congratulations to you, Skyler.

454
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:02,574
Great job.

455
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:04,492
What is this? What do I have to do?

456
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:08,621
- I'm trying to talk to you, and you--
- Okay, so talk, Walt.

457
00:40:09,122 --> 00:40:13,460
Shut up and say something
that isn't complete bullshit.

458
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:17,630
You want to know
what you have to do?

459
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,885
You have to tell me
what's really going on right now.

460
00:40:22,093 --> 00:40:24,929
Today. No more excuses.

461
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:29,142
No more apologies.
No more of these-- These obvious...

462
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,936
...desperate breakfasts.

463
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:36,441
You don't wanna lose
contact with me, Walt?

464
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:38,193
Good.

465
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:40,278
Then tell me.

466
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,364
Now.

467
00:40:54,793 --> 00:40:56,544
Tell you what?

468
00:41:02,383 --> 00:41:04,093
Skyler.

469
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,225
What is it you want me to tell you?
I don't know.

470
00:41:20,151 --> 00:41:22,737
We're not done here. Skyler.

471
00:41:24,364 --> 00:41:26,407
Do you know what
I've done for this family?

472
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,623
What the--?

473
00:41:48,555 --> 00:41:52,725
- Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?
- What is wrong with you?

474
00:41:52,934 --> 00:41:55,436
Why are you blue? Jesus.

475
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:59,065
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts
with my parents being greedy...

476
00:41:59,274 --> 00:42:03,069
- ...kleptomaniac douche bags.
- Are you actually this stupid?

477
00:42:03,278 --> 00:42:05,071
No, look. I know this isn't a optimal--

478
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,409
To come to my house and park
on my street, driving this vehicle.

479
00:42:09,617 --> 00:42:13,830
I mean, what the hell is wrong
with you? I'm really asking.

480
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:17,000
- Nothing. I'm sorry. I just--
- What if Skyler had seen you?

481
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:20,086
What then? What was the plan then,
genius, huh?

482
00:42:20,295 --> 00:42:22,630
- I don't know.
- You know why you don't know?

483
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:25,008
Because you don't think. That's why.

484
00:42:25,216 --> 00:42:27,927
You don't think.
You never figured out how to think.

485
00:42:28,136 --> 00:42:31,806
I said I was sorry. I just need
my half of the money, and I will go.

486
00:42:33,016 --> 00:42:34,434
Your half?

487
00:42:34,642 --> 00:42:37,145
There is no your half of the money.

488
00:42:37,353 --> 00:42:39,898
There is only my all of it.
Do you understand?

489
00:42:40,106 --> 00:42:43,401
Why should I be penalised
because of your sloppiness?

490
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,570
Look, that is completely uncool,
all right?

491
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:47,572
We agreed, fifty-fifty partners.

492
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:50,825
Partners in what?
What exactly do you do here?

493
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:54,245
I've been meaning to ask,
because I'm the producer, right?

494
00:42:54,454 --> 00:42:58,666
I cook. But from what I can tell,
you are just a drug addict.

495
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:04,088
You are a pathetic junkie,
too stupid to understand and follow...

496
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:07,842
...simple rudimentary instructions.
Too stupid to re--

497
00:43:28,404 --> 00:43:29,948
Do it.

498
00:43:57,517 --> 00:44:01,646
Try not to touch anything.

499
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:20,308
Want some breakfast?
