How's it coming?
Very, very well.
It's a flurry of deliveries.
Feels like Christmas morning.
Ahh, it's exciting.
It's really coming together. And I'd like to point out
that if you have any understandable questions
about the price tag...
That sound? Quality.
At Pfizer, at Merck, that unit would be right at home.
That goes for all of it.
Good. l want you to have what you need.
Oh. Well,
I doff my proverbial cap to you, sir. Ha-ha.
When do you think we'll be up and running?
Within a month, l'd say.
Two weeks.
Or, yeah, two weeks.
Good. Very good.
By the way, that sample you asked me to run?
I ran it, and it is quite good. Thank you very much, Gale.
You can give that to Victor to discard. Uh, sure.
Is that our competition?
I'm sorry? The, uh...
It really is quite good.
The purity, of course, l'm speaking of, speaking strictly in chemical terms.
And I can't, as of yet, account for the blue color,
but if that is our competition,
we have our work cut out for us, so to speak.
You don't have any competition, Gale, not as far as l'm concerned.
After all, how pure can pure be?
Well, it can be pretty darn pure.
Mr. Fring, I can guarantee you a purity of 96 percent.
I'm proud of that figure. It's a hard-earned figure, 96.
However, this other product is 99.
Maybe even a touch beyond that.
I'd need an instrument called a gas chromatograph
to say for sure,
but, um, that last 3 percent,
it may not sound like a lot, but it is.
It's tremendous.
It's a tremendous gulf.
Gale, for our purposes, 96 percent will do just fine.
Please, don't let this trouble you.
Yeah. It's just...
I'd love to know who synthesized it, is all.
A man who wants to work with me.
A trained chemist, like yourself.
But it won't happen.
I don't consider him a professional.
If he's not, I don't know what that makes me.
I'm not trying to talk myself out of a job--
With this person, there are other considerations.
His is the best l've ever seen, hands down.
And I look at this place that you've built,
the money you're investing,
sparing no expense.
And I know...
I know that you want the best.
6353 Juan Tabo. Apartment 6.
No, no. Eubank's west.
It's between Eubank and Spain, but Mazatlan's closest.
I don't know. I just heard the one, like, you know, a backfire, a truck backfiring.
I came out of my apartment. A couple came out.
No. No, nobody saw.
Did you guys see anybody?
Guys, did you--? l don't know if they speak English too good.
I don't think they saw anybody.
It was just this one loud-- This very loud pop and that was all.
No arguing or like that.
So you guys good in directions there? You want me to..?
They coming east or west?
If heading east, tell them there's an Exxon on their left-hand side.
Then it's straight residential. You want me to what? Yeah. No. I'll stay on the line.
You know him?
We all heard this shot.
I don't think you ought to go in there.
Mister, this is a crime scene. You don't wanna touch anything.
Mister?
Mister, are you listening to me?
Little bastard.
Drive.
What the hell happened?
He's gone?
Look at me.
Gone?
You sure?
Gone. Splattered all over.
Oh, Jesus. Jesus. Oh, shit.
All right.
So...
Shit.
All right, you do a sweep?
Couldn't. People there.
People? He get himself seen by these people?
What about you?
Yeah. So what?
Just another looky-loo.
I guess l'd better get this over with.
Hey.
Oh, jeez, I woke you up. I woke you up.
No, no, no, it's okay. I needed to get up anyway.
Are you coming in?
No. It's kind of my only time to run errands.
I just needed to... Ah.
I...
Sorry.
It's okay.
And thank you, bigtime, as always.
They seem to be getting bigger instead of smaller.
Not really sure what that's all about.
Please, for God's sake,
tell me if this is getting to be too much for you.
Absolutely not, okay? It's absolutely fine.
Okay.
Does this mean what I think it means? Heh.
What? You and Walt?
What?
His car is in the driveway. It's not a state secret.
I-- Oh. All right. Okay. I'm not pressing. I just...
I think that it's great.
That's all, all right?
I'm out of here. Okay.
Oh, hey. A big howdy-do to Mr. l'm-Not-Here.
in Albuquerque today.
But you know what? It always is when you have 330 days of sunshine a year.
On morning commute, northbound 25,
we've got a two-car accident on the right shoulder.
You gotta be careful. Also, from the west side,
we've got another accident, Paseo del Norte and Second Street.
That one's on the left shoulder, so be on the lookout.
That's a look at your morning commute on Coyote 1 02.5.
Oh, hey.
Breakfast?
Yeah. Yeah? Okay.
All right. What you want?
All right, look.
So I make it 1 0 to 9, which means--
Shut up.
Which means we need to start a cook in the next 1 0 minutes
to keep to our schedule.
Gus' schedule.
And as angry as he may be, I don't believe he's willing
to forfeit an entire batch.
That just might make him angrier.
Come on, Mike. Let us cook.
Isn't that what this whole thing is about?
That's right, genius. Watch me.
We ain't missing no cook.
We're closed.
Closed.
Saul Goodman and Associates.
I'll see if he's in. Please hold.
Saul, Skyler White calling.
Saul.
Saul, Skyler White on the line.
Saul. Hey.
Skyler White.
What the hell does she want?
He's nowhere to be found.
I called his condo, every number l have.
Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.
You're sure?
As in, you know where he is?
Heh, heh. I'm not the man's keeper, but Walt's a big boy. He'll turn up.
Mr. Goodman, something is going on.
Why would he leave his car in my driveway?
People carpool to work, right? It's good for the environment.
He carpools? He carpools to his job at a meth lab?
Hey, whoa. Oh-ho, you're breaking up there.
I didn't quite catch that last... Whew!
You're a Chatty Cathy today. Okay, do you know anything?
Anything at all? Please, I'm looking for some help here.
Look, Walter is fine, okay? I guarantee that, hundred percent.
One hundred percent.
You got a passport, right?
Yeah. Albuquerque.
I'm in Nob Hill.
I need the number for a locksmith.
I don't know. Pick one.
You sure there's nothing? No, it's not even me. lt's state law.
Are you sure there isn't some sort of--? I don't know.
No. Nothing.
Maybe a car registration. That would have your address.
No, but l can't even get in my car. My car keys were on the same ring.
My God, my credit cards, my-- It's all right, sweetheart.
My driver's license, my checkbook. I have to start canceling all that.
My whole life was in that purse and he just cut it right off my shoulder.
We could've been stabbed.
I'm sorry, really. But without proof of residency...
I can take you down to my shop.
You're welcome to wait, file a police report.
I can't believe this. I cannot believe this day.
I know. It's just, it's the law.
Oh, my God. My medication. I bet it's gone.
Oh, God, not now, not this. Gotta call the pharmacy.
Are you okay?
Please, just-- Please, just take her. Please. Just take her, please.
Oh. Oh, God.
Not now. No. Not now.
Oh, you're a lifesaver. Truly.
Here you go, sweetheart. Oh, there you go.
Um-- How do you--? How do you wanna deal with the bill?
I-- Unfortunately, all my cash was taken so...
That's fine. We'll mail it to you.
Will you? You know where l live, right?
Sir, again, thank you so much. Really. Yeah.
Hey there. l'm back.
How was PT?
I heard it was very good.
Mm. I'm really liking this new therapist.
He keeps me in the loop, always has time for a phone call. It's...
I like it.
So?
Tell me all about it.
I heard you broke new ground today.
I broke new ground?
That's what he said. Tell me.
I walked 1 6 feet in 20 minutes,
which is up from my 1 5 and a half yesterday.
And this much less shit in my pants.
So, yeah, Marie, if you and him and everybody in America took a vote,
changed the meaning of the English language,
yeah, I guess I "broke new ground."
Well, call it a figure of speech,
but l am seeing progress.
Definite progress.
You're ordering a new rock?
I'm bidding on a new mineral.
It's a nice one.
What? lt's pretty.
I need the thing.
Okay, numero uno. Dos.
Okay.
It has all those pretty little crystals. l like that.
Okay.
All right, I just wanna go on record, we should all be wearing masks.
We should be wearing masks.
Bet he forgets the aluminum.
Guaranteed.
Guarantee he forgets.
Mm-hm. Oh, you don't know what the hell you're doing, do you?
You forgot the aluminum.
One of the first steps in the...
Son of a bitch.
All right, let's talk about Gale Boetticher.
He was a good man and a good chemist,
and I cared about him.
He didn't deserve what happened to him.
He didn't deserve it at all.
But l'd shoot him again tomorrow and the next day and the day after that.
When you make it Gale versus me, or Gale versus Jesse,
Gale loses, simple as that.
This is on you, Gus. Not me, not Jesse.
Gale's death is on you.
I mean, really, what did you expect me to do,
just simply roll over and allow you to murder us?
That I wouldn't take measures, extreme measures to defend myself?
Wrong.
Think again. And whatever it is you're planning there,
whatever it is, the point that you're trying to make here,
let me suggest that you keep one thing in mind.
Without us, without Jesse and myself,
you have no one to make your product.
Certainly not him.
This person doesn't know what the hell he's doing.
Been watching him for weeks. I know every step of his cook.
Oh.
Do you really? You?
Really? Oh, so please tell me.
Catalytic hydrogenation, is it protic or aprotic? Because l forget.
If our reduction isn't stereospecific, how can our product be pure?
I mean, is 1-phenyl-1-hydroxy- 2-methylamino-propane,
containing, of course, chiral centers
at carbons number one and two on the propane chain?
Then reduction to methamphetamine
eliminates which chiral center is it again?
Because l forgot.
Come on, help me out, professor.
Gus.
We're here. Come on. Let us work.
All his bullshit aside, it's called a cook.
Everything comes down to following a recipe.
Simple, complicated, it doesn't matter.
The steps never change,
and I know every step.
Oh, is that what you want?
This short-order cook? You're not flipping hamburgers.
What happens when you get a bad barrel of precursor?
How would you even know it?
And what happens in the summer when the humidity rises
and your product goes cloudy?
How would you guard against that, huh?
Gus.
You do this, all you'll have left
is an $8 million hole in the ground.
This lab,
this equipment is useless without us.
Without Jesse and myself, you have no new product.
You have no income.
Your people out there will not be paid. Your distribution chain collapses.
Without us,
you have nothing.
You kill me, you have nothing.
You kill Jesse, you don't have me.
You won't do this.
You're too smart.
You can't afford to do this.
Please.
Let us just go back to work.
We're here.
Let us work. We're ready to go to work.
We'll just pick up right where we left off.
Well?
Get back to work.
Listen, we'll just lay this down.
Put him in feet first.
Grab his shoe.
Here. Wait, wait, wait. Just lift him up. There. All right.
Oh, God.
You push that way, I'll hold him in.
Okay, ready? One...
Oh, shit.
Wait, wait. Wait.
Forget that. Okay.
Come on. Up.
Get down.
Okay, okay.
I never use this stuff. Are you sure it'll do the job?
Trust us.
âª There was once a time âª
âª When l didn't mind âª
âª If l never saw the light âª
âª Oh âª
âª l can truly say âª
Here you go, hon. Get you anything else?
No, I'm good. Thanks.
âª Oh, l don't mind âª
âª If my hair starts turning gray âª
âª There's not much that I can do âª
âª Mm-hm âª
âª Long behind me l have Left my younger days âªâª
How you doing?
No, I mean, you know,
how are you doing?
You did the only thing that you could.
I hope you understand that.
Thoughts?
Any thoughts on what our next move might be?
What next move?
Our next move.
Our next move, given the fact that at the first opportunity, Gus will kill us.
What, that wasn't an opportunity just now?
Seemed like a damn good opportunity to me.
No, no. Golden, I would say.
We bought ourselves some time, yes, but...
The question is how much. He'll be looking for another chemist.
He's not gonna find another chemist. Hm.
Where is he gonna find another chemist?
It's not just about somebody being able to run a lab that big.
Someone he can trust,
someone he knows will keep their mouths shut.
Yeah. Good luck with that.
Bet it took him years to find Gale.
Heh. Bet he's sorry now.
Are you sure you're okay? Now we all understand each other.
Right?
What do you mean? I mean, him and us, we get it.
We're all on the same page.
And what page is that?
The one that says:
"lf I can't kill you,
you'll sure as shit wish you were dead."
Yo, excuse me.
Thanks.
Here.
Thank you, sir.
Have a good one.
Thanks.
Hi.
Um, it's parked over on Amsden.
Junior was about to get up and he would've seen it,
so I wanted to avoid a lot of questions.
Smart.
Well.
Kenny Rogers.
Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah.
Right as rain.
Do you have your keys?
Yeah.
Um... It's parked three blocks down on the right.
Yeah.
âª The truth is that I never shook my shadow âª
âª Every day it's trying To trick me into doing battle âª
âª Calling out "faker" Only get me rattled âª
âª Want to pull me back Behind the fence with the cattle âª
âª Building your lenses Digging your trenches âª
âª Put me on the front line Leave me with a dumb mind âª
âª With no defenses But your defense is âª
âª If you can't stand to feel the pain Then you are senseless âªâª

You can do this.
You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name,
number, and the reason for your call. Thank you.
Third try.
Walt, if you're there, please pick up.
I really wanted to do this together, but, um, l can hear him getting up.
It's not like l can keep him from seeing the thing.
So I'm sorry, but I've waited as long as possible and l...
I guess l'm gonna have to go ahead without you.
So call me.
Hey. Oh. Hey. Happy birthday, sweet 16.
Thanks, Mom.
Of course, l thought you might sleep through it.
Ha, ha. Hmm-hmm.
So since it's almost, oh, noon,
I think your first big birthday decision is breakfast or lunch?
Um, pancakes? Pancakes it is.
Oh, um, could you do me a favor?
I forgot to get the paper. Can you grab it for me?
Sure. Thanks.
Surprise.
It's from me and your dad. It's pretty slick, huh?
Uh... Yeah. Thanks, Mom. It's, uh... It's great.
I really did a lot of research,
and, I don't know, this car just really stood out to me.
It's got a ton of great features, power everything, solid engine.
It's really roomy so you can, you know, carpool with all your friends.
And, of course, it is safe because I'm still your mother.
Oh. And it has a CD player,
so you can listen to tunes while cruising around.
So you know what? Breakfast can wait. You wanna take it for a spin?
Um... Maybe later. I'm kind of starving.
Yeah, okay. Well, let's, uh... Let's get those pancakes going.
Saul, he's here.
Bad idea. This is a bad idea.
Saul?
Send him in.
Mr. Beneke. Saul Goodman. Thank you for coming down.
Hey. Yeah, hi.
Have a seat, please.
I, uh...
I don't understand why I'm here.
Something to do with my creditors? Creditors? No, uh...
I'll cut right to the chase, Mr. Beneke. I have some bad news.
Ah. Nothing but lately.
Your great-aunt Birgit passed away.
I'm sorry, who?
Um...
Apparently she passed away in Diekirch, Luxembourg.
And this was, uh-- Wow, eight years ago.
I just assumed you two were close, given that, uh...
Well, maybe this is good news.
Ha-ha. Birgit left behind a sizable estate
of which you, Mr. Beneke, are the primary beneficiary.
What?
She had no immediate relatives so the estate's just been sitting
while the folks over in the EU searched for a living heir.
Well, I don't know of any relatives in Luxembourg.
Definitely no one who would name me in their will.
Huh.
Well...
Oh. Well, here we go. She left no will. So that's probably why it took so long.
They traced the inheritance to your father.
But having passed-- My condolences.
-you are the next in line
to the tune of $621 ,552.33.
Wow.
And when does Don Eladio arrive?
Let's see how the cook goes first.
Who's the chemist?
Is this a joke?
He's asking if you're the chemist.
I'm one of them.
Okay, we've all met.
Let's get to work.
Where's the phenylacetic acid?
Please show him the phenylacetic acid.
We synthesize it ourselves.
All the ingredients are here.
They synthesize their own.
What?
I don't do that.
What's the problem?
Look, I get my phenylacetic acid from the barrel with the bee on it.
That's how l know how to do it.
Mr. Pinkman was under the impression that the phenylacetic acid
would already be synthesized upon his arrival.
Any sophomore chemistry student can make it.
What kind of amateur have you brought us?
What's he saying?
We're working it out.
This is ridiculous.
I'm not letting some infant who can't even synthesize phenylacetic acid
teach me my business.
Tell this asshole if he wants to learn how to make my product,
he's gotta do it my way. The right way.
I speak English.
So you understand what "asshole" means.
Now, go get me my phenylacetic acid, asshole.
How long is it gonna take to get him what he needs?
I don't know. I have no idea. Several hours, at least.
I can wait. Gives us time to talk about the state of this lab.
Don't you have standards?
I mean, this place is disgusting.
All right, we're gonna scour every vat, every tank, every cook surface.
We clean up every possible source of contamination. And only then we cook.
Who do you think you are?
I'm the guy your boss brought here to show you how it's done.
And if this is how you run your lab, no wonder.
You're lucky he hasn't fired your ass. Now, if you don't want that to happen,
I suggest you stop whining like a little bitch, and do what l say.
Clean up!
You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name,
number, and the reason for your call. Thank you.
Dad, you there?
I'm outside. Are you okay?
I know you're home, your car is here.
You missed my party which feels like something's gotta be really wrong.
I... l'm gonna have to call 91 1 . I don't know what else to do.
Dad?
Uh... Come in, if you're coming in.
What happened to you?
What happened?
I got into a fight.
What do you mean, a fight? Like--? What fight?
Are you gonna talk to me here?
What are you doing?
I'm calling Mom. Don't do that.
Look, I...
I appreciate that you're concerned, but l'm fine.
Just do not call your mother.
Why not?
Because...
I was gambling.
If you tell your mother, l just--
I will never-- Never hear the end of it.
So please.
Can we just keep this between us? Would you do that for me?
Just... Just keep it to yourself.
I don't understand. How'd you get into a fight?
And with who?
I made a mistake.
It's my own fault.
I had it coming. Dad,
it's okay.
It's all my fault.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Dad.
Come here.
Come on. Dad, it's okay.
No. Hey, hey, no.
It's okay. Come on, please. It's okay. No.
Look at me. Look at me.
It's okay. lt is. Come on.
Come on.
It's-- It's okay.
Hey.
How was your birthday?
Good. Get some rest.
Okay.
The new car...
did you drive it here?
Yeah. Mm. Mm.
That's good.
You like it?
Uh... Sure. l do.
It drives great.
That's good, Jesse.
Unh! Yes.
Yes. Well done.
The first of many.
Yeah? What's that mean?
You're staying. You belong to the cartel now.
You can't come to my work like this. You're too recognizable.
Your face is plastered on every bus bench within a five-mile radius.
Celebrities have to get their cars washed just like everybody else.
I wouldn't have come if it wasn't important.
Okay? What is it?
Well, I, uh, went ahead and met with your Mr. Beneke. Right?
Which, I will say again, loudly and for the record, bad idea.
Yes, but it is better than prison, correct?
Marginally. Which is why l disbursed the funds as you requested.
All right, good.
Yeah. I can't believe he actually bought it.
Great-aunt Birgit. What?
But you called it. People see zeroes dance before their eyes,
it's like highway hypnosis. So, what's the problem?
Let's just say, you and I don't wear the same rose-colored glasses
where Johnny Fabulous is concerned.
So I kept an eye on his bank accounts, and pulled his credit report.
If you would, note the time on that.
Three fifty-four p.m. yesterday.
Three hours after leaving my office. He bought a Mercedes SL550.
He's actually leasing it, but he put 4500 down.
He's gonna pay 1 830 a month.
Fully loaded. He even got the heated steering wheel.
But that's upwards of 6300 that won't be going to the IRS.
I just thought you might like to know, loath as I am to say, I told you so.
Where is he now?
Hmm.
Hey.
Mm.
How you doing?
Good.
Um... How are you?
I'm fine, but your mother is going to be worried sick.
I called her last night.
Oh, God.
I told her I was spending the night at Louis'.
It's cool. So...
Uh, how are you?
I'm fine, son. l...
I...
Well, I...
I took these painkillers that I had leftover from my surgery,
and I made the brilliant decision
to wash them down with a couple of beers.
Not my most sterling moment, I admit.
But l'm fine.
I wish I could take back last night. It was your birthday.
This shouldn't be on your mind. It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
I'm your father, and I don't want last night to be...
I mean, you really...
can't think of me like...
Like what?
I don't understand.
My father died when I was 6.
You knew that, right? Yeah.
He had Huntington's disease. lt's...
It destroys portions of the brain,
affects muscle control,
leads to dementia, it's just a nasty disease.
It's genetic.
Terrified my mother that I might have it,
so they ran tests on me when l was a kid, but I came up clean.
My father fell very ill when l was...
four or 5.
He spent a lot of time in the hospital.
My, uh...
Heh. My mother would tell me so many stories about my father.
She would talk about him all the time.
I knew about his personality,
how he treated people,
I even knew how he liked his steaks cooked.
Medium rare.
Just like you.
I knew things about my father.
I had a lot of information.
It's because people would tell me these things.
They would paint this picture
of my father for me.
And I always pretended that was who I saw too.
Who I remembered. But it was a lie.
In truth, I only have one real,
actual memory of my father.
It must have been right before he died.
My mother would take me to the hospital to visit him.
And I remember the smell in there, the chemicals.
It was as if they used up
every single cleaning product they could find in a 50-mile radius.
Like they didn't want you smelling the sick people.
There was this stench of Lysol and bleach.
I mean, you could just feel it coating your lungs.
Anyway, there lying on the bed,
is my father.
He's all...
He's all twisted up.
And my mom,
she puts me on her lap.
She's sitting on the bed next to him so I can get a good look at him.
But really, he just scares me.
And he's looking right at me,
but l can't even be sure that he knows who I am.
And your grandmother is talking,
trying to be cheerful, you know, as she does,
but the only thing I could remember...
is him breathing.
Ah, this...
This rattling sound.
Like if you were shaking an empty spray paint can.
Uh-huh.
Like there was nothing in him.
Anyway...
that is the only real memory that I have of my father.
I don't want you to think of me the way I was last night.
I don't want that to be the memory you have of me when I'm gone.
Remembering you that way...
wouldn't be so bad.
The bad way to remember you would be the way...
The way you've been this whole last year.
At least last night you were...
You were real, you know?
Bye. Bye.
Somewhere you should be?
Well, basically it was a temporary hiatus.
But you give us two weeks, we will be up and running 1 00 percent.
All right, you talk to your people and get back to me, okay?
Hi. Yeah, thanks, Tanya.
Okay. You bet. Say hi to the kids for me.
Hey. Hi.
Nice surprise. What's up?
Just thought I'd swing by, see how things are going.
Well, things are, um... Things took a turn. It's kind of crazy.
Oh, yeah?
The universe is telling me something. I got some good news.
Some very good news...
and, um, I'm getting the business going again.
Wow. Ha-ha.
I figure we haven't been down long,
so we should be able to get most of our old contracts back. Sit.
Oh, thank you. That's--
Um... Gosh, that's, uh...
That's wow. Ha-ha-ha.
How is that even possible?
Well, I got a very unexpected cash infusion.
Huh.
I guess someone's looking out for me.
I guess so.
Um...
Is that yours, outside?
Oh. Yeah, well, you know,
I can't be driving a piece of crap.
You got to present that successful image.
Right. So the lRS stuff. That's resolved?
Yeah, it's in progress.
So you paid them?
Well, not yet, but I will.
When?
Well, it's not that simple.
Um... Here's the thing: I never had proper legal counsel.
So I was thinking
I should hire someone good who can maybe hammer out a better deal.
There will never be a better deal, Ted.
The deal is you pay your back taxes,
you pay your penalty, and you don't go to prison.
That's a good deal. So...
Let's keep our priorities straight.
Well, my priority is getting my business back.
And putting my employees back on the payroll so they can pay their mortgages.
Right. But l think your employees would agree
that you need to get your financial situation in control
before you can help them.
Boy, the IRS got you on commission?
I'm just saying that, though I really understand
the temptation to restart the business,
maybe the universe is telling you
that you need to pay what you owe.
Skyler, um,
this is my money. Um...
Why are we having this conversation? You're no longer a part of my life.
A decision you made, by the way.
So I don't understand why you're hectoring me about this.
Ted, this affects both of us. No it doesn't.
I'm telling you to drop this.
You need to use that money to pay your bill
by the end of this month,
which you promised the lRS in writing that you would do.
It is that simple.
Okay.
Okay, duly noted.
What does that mean?
Does that mean yes? Because I really need a yes here, Ted.
All right, Skyler, I'll tell you what it means. lt means,
in the most respectful way possible, there's the door.
And I'm inviting you to, you know...
And thank you for your concern, but l'm done talking about this.
From whom exactly do you think you got that 600,000, Ted?
Great-aunt Birgit?
That was you?
Yeah.
What is this shit?
I don't get a vote?
I'm supposed to just stay down here forever?
I promise you this:
Either we're all going home or none of us are.
Now settle down.
On your feet.
Gustavo.
I'm so happy
you finally came to your senses.
May I present the cook.
This is your new employer.
You address him as Don Eladio.
It's a term of respect.
Hello, young man.
He doesn't speak a word of Spanish, does he?
And he's no chemist,
I'll tell you that.
I don't care if he's a pig farmer.
He cooks better meth than you do,
with all your fancy college degrees.
And this one will have plenty of time to learn Spanish.
What's in there?
A gift?
Gustavo, you're so generous.
It's a token of respect.
In honor of our renewed friendship.
Mm.
Let's see what's in here.
No, impossible!
Zafiro AÃ±ejo!
Look at this.
Even the bottle is a work of art.
It's perfection!
Perhaps,
it's too good to share.
What do you think, Gustavo?
It's yours to do with as you choose.
Aha.
I choose
to drink it!
Careful.
That's beautiful stuff.
If you spill a drop,
I'll cut off your hand.
Ha.
Come on, hurry up.
Gustavo.
Welcome to Mexico.
Now you say:
This one's an addict.
To work, he must be sober.
None for you! Ho, ho.
Aah. Mm!
Enough business!
Bring the girls!
No. No, no, I don't...
âª You need to act like you know The data in my flow âª
âª Like the wall of Jericho âª
âª From the six-shooter pop-pop We vibrate your drop-top âª
âª Baretta the spitta With my manguera âª
âª Like beach shoes, they flip-flop âª Chota wanna see my profile âª
âª Call me Alfred Hitchcock The sound is like a gunshot âª
Gustavo.
Cheer up, man.
Gustavo,
I'm not angry.
I had to spank you.
But what choice did l have?
Look, once every 20 years,
you forget your place.
There's no place for emotion in this.
You of all people should understand.
Business is business.
If you'll excuse me.
Where are you going? To use your bathroom.
If I may.
Miguel!
Show Gustavo the pisser.
And make sure he doesn't get lost.
Hurry up.
âª I be the cinder block cracka Got weed mixed with tobacca âª
âª Audio the massacre My lawyer screaming Attica âªâª
âª Oh, come on âª
âª People say âªâª
Make yourself useful. Find a gun.
Don Eladio is dead!
His capos are dead!
You have no one left to fight for!
Fill your pockets,
and leave in peace!
Or fight me
and die!
I hope to hell that works.
Take him.
Keys.
No. No.
Okay. Okay.
Hey. Hey, you still with us?
Go.
Kid, get us out of here, kid.
Come on.
ï»¿8
In here.
Hey! Hey! Hey! What about him?
What about him?
Hey. Someone.
Help. Ugh. Assistance.
This man needs help.
This man pays my salary.
Forty-point-two-three pounds.
Are they back yet?
Have you heard from anyone?
If Pinkman is gone,
I'm done. Do you understand? I quit.
I just told you, 40.23 pounds.
Forty-point-two-one.
My brother-in-law, he keeps talking about driving out to the factory farm.
And I have-- l have stalled him as long as I possibly can.
It's really at the point now
where he's gonna find someone else to take him there.
So I don't know if it's been made presentable yet.
But l should be the one to take him out there, right?
Can you just run it up the chain of command then?
Anything suspicious?
Still no, Walt. Heh.
Well, then should we go?
Got some place to be? Because it's, like, the third time you asked me that.
No, I'm just curious what the next move is.
Our next three moves is sitting here and waiting.
This here's the job, buddy.
Ain't all supermodels and speedboats, you know.
Any, uh, cartel news these days?
Seems like l'm always reading something or other in the paper.
Yeah, well, not a lot happening stateside.
Hearing rumblings about some big play down south.
Lots of bodies, apparently. Tsk.
You know, even by cartel standards.
We'll know more when the buzzards leave the bones.
So when we gonna talk about your face?
I don't wanna get into it, okay? No, it's not okay.
My brother-in-law shows up looking like Macho Camacho,
and he thinks we're not gonna discuss it?
If you're in over your head on something,
don't you think I might be the guy to come to?
You know, one of my old, uh, buddies from Glynco had a gambling problem,
except his thing was scratch cards instead of blackjack. Heh.
Dumb Okie bastard had his car repo'd playing scratch-and-wins. Heh-heh.
He's fine now, you know. He got help and all.
But l know he got on a ride that was rough to get off of.
I'm just saying l'm here, you know.
If you want to talk about it.
I don't want to talk about it, to you or to anyone else.
I'm done explaining myself.
Hey, uh... Yo, you think he needs more blood?
It's in the refrigerator.
What, you--? You want me to, uh...?
A-negative, yes?
Your blood type?
Um... I don't know, maybe.
A-negative, 25 years old,
seventy kilo, 1 80 centimeters.
You smoke, you drink, you, uh, puff, puff, puff.
Tsk-tsk-tsk.
But no disease, no condition.
No complication other than an allergy to...
Oh, wait, don't say.
Erythromycin.
But l have cefazolin here, so no problem.
How do you know all that?
Jesus.
He thought of everything.
O-negative.
That's what he needs.
It's time to go.
What about Mike?
With this injury? No travel. At least a week.
I'll send for him.
You need protection, Gustavo?
I wouldn't have guessed.
Water and rest.
What happened to the plane?
There are many good ways south.
But, unfortunately, only one way north.
Six miles to Texas.
I've got a man there who'll drive us the rest of the way.
I kind of liked the plane.
So you gonna make it? Six miles is pretty far.
I'll make it.
You did well down here.
And you also proved a point.
I think you can run the lab by yourself now.
Don't you?
Let Mr. White go.
Pay him off or fire him.
Don't kill him.
You know that won't work. Then you got a problem.
Hi. We're home.
Are you doing your homework?
Yeah.
Mm-hm. Well, dinner is in about 30.
Hey, sorry to call you at home,
but I think maybe you're not getting my messages.
That or you just don't feel like talking to me.
Anyway, why l've been calling is because that thing we discussed?
Well, I've been thinking,
and, uh, I decided l can't do it. That's probably not what you wanted to hear.
But hopefully you'll understand,
and if you want to talk more about it, that's fine.
So call me. l'm around.
Hey. Come on in. Hi.
Ahem. First, l wanna tell you that I get it.
From what you've told me, this situation with Walt's gambling sounds...
intense.
Yeah, it definitely was.
And continues to be.
So I would greatly appreciate it if you would just...
help me out here.
Well, I've thought long and hard about this...
and, uh, here's what I want to do. Ahem.
So is, uh, Walt gonna be okay?
Are you in contact with him?
Um, he's fine.
Good. That's good.
He doesn't know about you offering--? No. Absolutely not.
And I mean to keep it that way, so...
Six hundred and seventeen thousand dollars written out to me.
Uh... What is this?
I can't take your money. Oh?
And why is that? Because, at the end of the day,
paying my debt with illicit gambling winnings, uh...
I don't know, it feels wrong.
"lt feels wrong"?
To me it does. Uh-huh.
I'm not judging you or Walt. I'm just saying I feel uncomfortable with it.
Well, um, Ted, the whole reason we're in this mess
is because you had me cooking your books.
So when did wrong suddenly become a problem for you?
Now, hold on, that was a one-time measure
in an honest attempt to protect my employees
and save my dad's company.
It might've been a mistake, but that's no reason to go out and make another.
No, Ted, this is the big mistake, right here.
You owe the federal government $61 7,000. If you do not pay them,
they will come after you and then they will come after me.
And if they audit my business, find out that Walt and l paid for it
with close to a million dollars in untaxed gambling winnings,
we will go to prison, where you will already be. Do you understand?
I understand you're upset, but I think you're overstating things too.
No one's going to prison.
Oh, my God. How are you not following me here?
Okay, fine, let's say l take your advice.
I pay the IRS. Then what?
Then you don't owe them.
Okay, but l still owe the bank, Skyler.
I'm still going to go bankrupt and lose my business and my home.
I still have to pull my girls out of school.
Just because I pay some stupid fine doesn't make my life any less ruined.
So if l'm understanding you correctly,
you're saying you can't take the money I gave you...
but you can take a larger amount.
No. I'm just saying,
as much as l appreciate the gesture,
the money you gave me doesn't really change anything.
Because it's not enough? No, no, don't twist my words.
This isn't about amounts, this is about me doing the right thing.
Ted, are you blackmailing me? What? No. Blackmailing?
God.
I feel I'm not explaining things right. I think you're explaining it fine.
I notice that, uh, this is for less than what I gave you, by the way.
That's the Mercedes. I leased it before I knew where the money came from.
Mm. Now that you know, you will be returning it.
The leases are ironclad, so I have to see what's possible,
but, yeah, I'm gonna do my best.
And I will pay you back as soon as I can.
I don't want you to pay me, Ted. I want you to pay them.
Try it again.
Write a new check.
Skyler. Same amount.
This time, made payable-- What happened to us?
Make it payable to the Internal Revenue Service.
I can't. You have to.
Actually, no I don't. Write it.
Saul Goodman, please.
Tell him it's important.
Yeah.
What have I done?
Hello, Hector.
All of them, Hector.
Don Eladio.
Don Paco. Cesar.
Renaldo. Artuno.
Cisco and Luis.
Escalada.
All dead.
As is your grandson, Joaquin.
Do you know who killed Joaquin?
Would you like to see?
This young man.
Do you remember him?
That young man shot Joaquin to death...
while I made my escape.
I believe you have met him before.
It was just you and Joaquin.
He was the only family you had left.
Now the Salamanca name dies with you.
Will you look at me now?
Look at me, Hector.
Look at me.
I really appreciate you doing this.
You guys must have your hands filled with the car wash and all.
No, no. No worries.
Happy to do it.
Besides, it gives me a chance to see how you work a case. Ha-ha.
It's, uh, interesting. Yeah.
Like watching weeds grow, huh? Heh.
Ah, this job can be boring as hell.
Until it's not.
So, um...
Any more news on that thing in Mexico?
No, same old, same old. Bunch of animals clawing each other's eyes out over turf.
So you think all the victims were cartel members?
Not in the loop enough to know. Take a right on this street, will you?
Right?
But, uh, we're going to the chicken farm, that's straight ahead.
No, we're taking a little detour.
All right.
Yeah, there's this, uh, industrial laundry I wanna check out.
It's not far. Just, yeah, turn right here.
What, uh--? What laundry? What about it?
It's owned by this company, this Madrigal Electromotive.
It's this big German conglomerate right into everything.
It turns out it's the same company that owns Fring's chicken joints.
Sounds like a real shot in the dark there.
I mean, you said it yourself.
If this Madrigal, is it?
If this is such a big conglomerate,
then, you know, they must own all kinds of businesses.
No, it just-- It just sounds kind of thin.
Well, look at you. You lose your hair, go on a couple stakeouts,
all of a sudden you're, what, Kojak? He-he-he.
I'm just saying.
Now, the chicken farm, however, boy, that place seems ripe
for some kind of clandestine activities.
I just don't want us to miss anything, you know?
You wanna talk about clandestine activities?
Madrigal Electromotive also owns a subsidiary
that manufactures this state-of-the-art air-filtration system.
And none other than Gale Boetticher took delivery of one of these systems.
A chemist who was in possession of hand-drawn plans
for a meth super-lab and was visited by none other than Gus Fring
just days before he was capped in the face, okay?
This shit is starting to feel like--
Like Three Days Of The Condor, you know?
Anyway, an industrial laundry would be one hell of a place to hide a meth lab.
There it is right up there. Just turn in there.
Walt, slow down. You gotta turn in there, Walt.
What are you doing? You missed it. Sorry.
It looked like a dirt road. I thought you meant further up.
Just-- Just bang a U-ie over here.
Whoa!
Mm. Hits the spot.
Thanks, guys.
Heh-heh. l said to Mom "ice cream," but, um, she was like:
"lt tastes the same
and it's healthier." So, heh, sorry.
I tried.
Frozen yogurt does taste the same. Tastes exactly the same.
Wow. l feel, like, sorry for your taste buds.
Heh-heh. Weigh in here, Uncle Hank. Hey, it's free food. Ahem.
Free food always tastes good. Free drinks even better.
Hey, hon.
Can you handle another visitor?
Ho-ho! Mr. Magoo. Yeah, sure.
Hey, watch out.
Don't run into any walls or anything. Ha-ha. Okay.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, son.
So how you feeling, Hank?
It feels like one of those cones they put on dogs,
so they don't lick their own balls. Nice. Thank you. Stay classy.
Anyway, hanging in there. Glad you stopped by.
Listen, I'm sorry about all this.
I mean, that guy just came out of nowhere.
Yeah, actually, he didn't.
I saw him coming a mile away.
Hey, just mark it down as a brain fart
and, uh, be thankful no one got killed.
Well, I'll tell you one thing. Your Hardy Boys routine is over.
No more asking him to drive you on stakeouts.
It's too dangerous. You hear me?
I'll do it. No, you won't.
No, Marie's right. It was a bit short-sighted of me.
That's why l, uh, caved.
Caved?
Yeah, I broke down. I, uh, ordered me a gimp-mobile.
I wish you would stop calling it that.
What do you mean? Like a handi-van with a lift?
No, no, it's a regular Tahoe. It's got hand controls. l ordered it.
Should be here in about a week. I don't expect to be in it long,
but, uh, gotta get around on my own. Stop being such a damn burden to everyone.
Oh.
Oh. Sorry. Car wash business.
Hey, it's me. Can you talk?
I can listen.
Fair enough. He doesn't own a gun,
at least not one that he bought legally.
Nor does his home security system have any panic-button arrangement.
So way I see it, we're good to go. If this is still how you want to handle it.
Like l said, l don't want anyone hurt.
All l want is for him to write a check.
Yeah. It's gonna be fine. I've got my A-team on it.
Can l help you? Yeah, thanks.
What--? You just can't--
What's this about? I'll tell you what this is about.
This is about you and me doing our best to keep Huell happy.
Huell? Who's Huell? This is Huell.
Huell, you happy? Reasonably.
What would make you unhappy?
This motherfucker not doing what he's told.
If you were unhappy, Mr. Beneke wouldn't care for that?
I'm gonna say no.
Well, there you have it. Let's go find your checkbook. Ready?
Here we go. All right? We're walking, we're swinging our feet.
There you go. Very nice. Beautiful place you have here.
This way. So the amount's gonna be for $61 7,226--
Whoa. l don't have that kind of money. Hold that thought.
Forgot to mention we know exactly how much money is in your account, okay?
Understand? You still want to say that stuff from before? Maybe not.
So $61 7,226 and 31 cents,
made payable to the Internal Revenue Service.
What?
Wait, this is, uh...?
Skyler? Skyler White sent you? It doesn't matter.
For now, all you have to do is worry about that.
My God, this is a misunderstanding.
Skyler is a dear friend of mine, all right?
Let me call her. We'll, uh...
No, you're misunderstanding, Mr. Beneke. Phone-call time is over.
Check-writing time. Skyler would never do this to me.
Sit down and write!
There you go.
Six hundred seventeen thousand, two hundred twenty-six dollars
and thirty-one...
Yeah, right.
You got it.
Huell, you happy? Ha-ha. Huell's happy.
All right. Everything else has been filled out for you.
All's we need...
is a signature
right there.
Great.
Hard part is over.
Here's what happens next. Huell is gonna hang here with you.
I'm gonna make sure I get this down to UPS before 5:00.
Way back, I'm gonna grab some sandwiches.
The three of us can hang out and play cards or watch TV
for the next couple of days until the check clears.
Painless, right?
Unless you don't have cable,
in which case it's gonna suck, so...
Does the laundry have to be dirty?
Nope.
Someone cooked here.
You've been out of commission four days.
You think we're gonna shut down the whole operation just for you?
Who cooked? Who was here?
I don't know how you're doing the flips. Tell me.
Keep cool.
Oh. Oh, I'm gonna get you. Oh, I'm gonna get you.
Jump.
You're pressing buttons, and it makes you do magical stuff.
No. Yes. Cheater.
Hey. Who's winning?
I am. Well-- Yeah. Look at you.
Look at-- Ooh. Yeah.
A hundred and one back flips, l did. Oh, you. Hey, keep it going.
Hey, hey, hey. Relax.
Ooh. You're in trouble.
Good luck.
Mama is in the house.
Jesse.
What do you want? l'm busy. We need to talk.
I got nothing to say to you, man.
Jesse, please. I'm sorry.
Just one minute. That's all I ask.
Get the hell out of my house.
Come on. Come on.
Hey. Just give me one minute.
Let me just explain. Okay.
Let me-- Shh! Shh!
All right. All right. Okay, okay. All right, I'm sorry.
I know that you have been cooking without me.
That's right. So what?
So what?
Isn't it obvious to you what Gus is planning?
He's going to use you to replace me.
He doesn't think you need me anymore.
Jesse. Jesse, if you agree
to replace me,
he will kill me.
You brought your brother-in-law to our lab. What the hell is wrong with you?
That's not my fault, Jesse. Get off.
You've got to help me. Please.
The last time I asked for your help, you said:
"l hope you end up buried in a barrel in the Mexican desert."
You are done.
Fired.
Do not show your face at the laundry again.
Stay away from Pinkman.
Do not go near him.
Ever.
Are you listening to me?
Or else you'll do what?
What did you say?
Stay away from Pinkman...
or else you'll do...
what?
Kill me?
If you could kill me...
I'd already be dead.
But you can't.
You can't kill me,
because Jesse wouldn't cook for you if you did.
That's it, isn't it?
No matter how hard you try
to turn him against me,
to screw with his head,
so that he would hate my guts,
and he still won't let you do it.
For now.
But he'll come around.
In the meantime, there's the matter of your brother-in-law.
He is a problem you promised to resolve.
You have failed.
Now it's left to me to deal with him.
You can't--
If you try to interfere...
this becomes a much simpler matter.
I will kill your wife.
I will kill your son.
I will kill your infant daughter.
Great. Perfect. You know, this is just...
I told her you were my A-team.
It was an act of God.
Ain't no accounting for no act of God.
Check is in the mail, at least.
"Hello, Mrs. White.
The good news is the IRS has been paid off.
The bad news is..." Ugh! Jesus!
Well, here goes nothing.
Hey! Hey!
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.
What the--?
Saul.
How did you hear? What? Hear what?
Guys, go, go, go. Scram.
What the hell happened to you? Saul. Saul.
This man that we spoke of before.
This person that you said could disappear me.
Give me a new life. Yeah.
Make sure I'm never found. Yeah.
Yeah, I need him, Saul.
Gus is gonna murder my whole family.
Christ.
I need this man now.
Saul. Now, Saul! Yeah, yeah.
There's no coming back. You're gonna get new Socials, new identities.
You can't contact your friends or relatives ever again.
All right. I understand. How are you gonna sell this
to that wife of yours and your son? I have got no choice.
You're wanted by scary individuals, not to mention the law.
You're high-risk. You'll need the deluxe service. lt'll cost you.
How much?
Last quote l got on the deluxe was 125 grand.
But you got four people. It'll be at least half a million.
He accepts cash only. I've got the money.
Please! Here.
Okay.
This is a vacuum cleaner repair company.
Did you expect Haji's Quick-Vanish? I don't even know his name.
You just call and leave a message.
You tell them that you need a new dust filter
for a Hoover MaxExtract Pressure Pro, Model 60.
I wrote it right on there. He'll call you back.
Okay, fine. How long does it take for him to arrange?
The guy works fast. That's the game.
You gotta have your family packed and ready before you make the call.
He'll tell you where to meet, he'll put you up in a safe house.
You gotta bring money. He doesn't lift a finger unless he's paid.
Okay.
Saul. Can't say it's been a pleasure--
I need you to do one more thing for me.
You need to call the DEA.
You need to tell them Gus has a hit out on Hank.
You have to do it for me. I gotta go on living here.
I'm way too comfortable in my-- Just call anonymously.
You call anonymously! I can't!
I'm practically in the DEA family.
I go to their Christmas parties. They know me. They know my voice.
They'll know me. Please, you gotta do it for me.
Please. Please. No.
My brother-in-law doesn't deserve to die because of this.
There's no way I'm mentioning Gus.
Okay. The most I'll go--
I'll say it's the cartel. They're back to finish the job.
You say whatever you have to say. You just give me an hour to...
I need to collect my wife and kids. Okay?
Give me an hour and then you make the phone call. Don't forget. Please.
Yeah.
Thank you, Saul.
No, no, no.
Where's the rest?
That's not enough. That's not enough.
Walt?
Down here!
Walt, what did that phone call mean?
Where is it?
Where's the rest?
The money, Skyler. Where is the rest?
Skyler, where is the money?
I gave it to Ted.
What?
You did what? Walt, I had to.
For us, for the family.
I swear, Walt--
You gave our money to Beneke?
Walt, please. Please just hear me out. Please.
Walt.
Walt.
Hi, you've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.
Skyler.
It's happening again.
The DEA called, they got some tip from an informant.
The cartel, they want to kill Hank.
Oh, God.
They're sending agents to our house right now to guard us.
Oh, God.
When is this going to end?
Marie, I'm here.
I'm here.
Tell me exactly what happened.
ï»¿2
They're here, out front.
How many?
Nelson Brey, three others.
His toothbrush? Got it.
What about your stuff?
Oh, we'll talk to them about stopping at your place.
Skyler. Skyler.
What? I'm not going.
What? I'm not going to Hank and Marie's.
We're in danger. Yes, that's true. Because of me.
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is the rest of you are safe.
And that's why I'm not going with you.
I'm the real target.
But we'll all be safer at Hank's. No, no, no.
No one will be safe at Hank's if l'm there.
Walt, it's the DEA.
Skyler, you don't know these people.
I-- No. Skyler, please.
Trust me. This is how it has to be.
Those agents outside. They're not gonna just leave you here.
It's protective custody.
All they know is that Hank is the only person that's in danger.
They're including us as a courtesy to Marie, to keep her happy.
How am l supposed to explain that to Marie or Junior? Or Hank?
I don't know.
But you'll do it. You'll figure it out.
Hank knows that Marie will be overreacting.
Except she's not.
I'll talk to Hank. You just back me up with everyone else.
You really expect me to say, "Okay, Walt, sure. Just stay here and"...
No.
There's gotta be another way.
There isn't.
There was.
But now there isn't.
Walt,
how long till you're safe?
Till you can work this out?
Oh, Skyler.
No.
Skyler. No.
I have lived under the threat of death for a year now.
And because of that, I've made choices.
I-- Listen to me.
I alone should suffer the consequences of those choices, no one else.
And those consequences...
they're coming.
No more prolonging the inevitable.
Feed that belt through those seatbelt holders.
Hank, I've got a car wash to run.
I mean, you don't honestly believe that I'm in danger, do you? Me?
Oh, Jesus, it's gonna go over like a lead balloon. It'll be Marie that kills me.
Well, just know that I'll get there as soon as I can.
And let Steve Gomez know. I told his guys.
And, uh, just stay safe.
Oh, please. Whole thing's just a giant jerk-off.
Yeah, yeah. But, uh, keep your head down anyway, all right?
All right.
All right, buddy. Take care.
Shh, shh, shh.
I know.
Shh, shh, shh.
Okay, sweetie.
Okay, my love. Okay. Okay.
Okay, my darling. lt's okay.
We're all right.
Okay. Shh.
âª Why âª
âª Say goodbye? âª
âª We are born again âª
âª When we die âª
âª But we will never Leave our lives âªâª
He's gonna risk his life over a stupid car wash?
Does he understand what's going on with Uncle Hank?
He'll come when he's able.
That's pathetic. I--
How hard did you even try or did you?
Hey, hey, hey. Lay off your mom. Well, you know, Hank,
we wouldn't be arguing about this if you and Steve would make him come.
Why didn't your people put him in the car?
It's not Nazi Germany, all right? Oh, you-- Nazi Germany.
If I had a dollar for every time I heard that. l'm gonna call him.
He's gonna get his behind here immediately. End of story.
Thank you. At least somebody is listening.
Because we are all in danger here. We're not all in danger here.
Will you stop saying that? That is asking for trouble.
Come on, Walt.
He's not picking up.
Look, could we just take this down a notch, okay? Everybody?
You guys can stay here as long as you like.
We got plenty of room.
I wouldn't worry about any danger to Walt or any of us, okay?
This whole thing is just a damn smoke screen.
How do you mean "a smoke screen"?
An anonymous threat against me?
I'm stuck in a wheelchair, I'm not even on the job.
No, someone didn't like the way I've been spending my free time.
What? Minerals?
Timing seem a bit odd to you, huh?
I start looking into, uh...
Fring, all of a sudden I'm on lockdown for my protection?
Whoa. Gus Fring? Did you say--?
What--? From the chicken restaurant?
Hank, what are you talking about?
Just one man's humble opinion, that's all.
I think Los Pollos Hermanos is a front
for the biggest meth distributor in the Southwest.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Steve, are you even looking into this?
We're looking into everything.
But we work on fact, not conjecture.
And the fact is that the scumbags that hit you first were Mexican cartel,
not some German multinational whatever.
Definitely not Colonel Sanders.
Now, if we even had a shred of proof--
Isn't that what you get paid to go get?
Remember that laundry I told you about? I'd start there.
Come on, man.
Ah, Jesus.
It's a perfect spot for a meth superlab.
Oh, my God.
Hey...
what if l'm right?
Even if you were right-- And you ain't.
-there's no way a judge is gonna give me a warrant.
Warrant? What happened to good old-fashioned knock and talk?
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.
You were never very good at those, were you?
Can l help you? Yes, sir.
We wondered if we could take a look around.
Why?
Sorry, what's your name? Dennis.
Dennis. Hey. l'm Steve Gomez. I'm with the DEA. Drug Enforcement.
Is there a problem?
For you? No. No problem.
We were just wondering if we could take a look around. I, uh...
Can l tell you a story?
Yeah. I bust this chef.
Well, he says he's a chef.
Because you work at a restaurant that charges $14 for a burger,
that don't make you a chef. Makes you a burger-flipper.
Least in my book. Yeah, heh.
Anyway, so we bust this chef, heroin possession.
He says, "Just because you found heroin in my chef whites doesn't make it mine.
Maybe it came from the place that launders my chef whites." This place.
We don't do that stuff over here.
I know, I know.
I'll say it for you.
His story is a big load of steaming horse shit.
We're gonna find heroin here like we're gonna find Jimmy Hoffa.
Right?
The thing is that this chef's daddy is a United States senator.
I'm not gonna tell which one, but you know who he is.
So now I gotta waste my time checking out this burger-flipper's story.
If I don't, his old man's gonna jam me up,
my ASAC, my whole entire office.
Politics, huh?
So, what do you think?
Listen, I have to check on my boss.
He's out of town. I can't promise I'll reach him anytime soon.
Well, yeah. That's probably the way to go.
I'll have to go get a warrant and we'll do it official.
You have to close down for the day.
What--? Why? Twenty agents poking around?
It'd be less trouble if it was just us.
But your call.
Just the two of you? You make it quick, right?
Dennis, we'll be like the wind.
Okay. Could you tell him?
Okay. Okay.
Can you clear out some of your people for us?
Confuses the dog's nose.
So...
how long we gotta be quiet down here?
And what happens after this?
Provided they don't find their way in here and bust our asses?
I gotta be, like, snuck down here in a laundry hamper for the rest of eternity?
Now, I'm going on record.
This, uh-- This blows.
Hello.
For you.
Yeah?
Do you know what's happening upstairs?
I have a pretty good idea.
This is all the result of your former partner.
Do you understand now?
Do you see why this can't continue?
I get it. The guy is a complete and total dick.
But l can't.
I'm not signing off.
Okay?
Like l said,
if something final happens to Mr. White,
we're going to have a problem.
So, what are you gonna do?
There will be an appropriate response.
Appropriate? What does that mean?
Hello?
They're gone.
We're good.
You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name, number and the reason for your call. Thank you.
You have six new messages.
Hey, kid. lt's me, Goodman.
Give me a call, would you?
Hey, need to hear from you. Hope l made myself clear about that.
Call me as soon as you can.
Pinkman, get over here. Stat, pronto.
Don't call, just get over here. Would you just, please?
I don't know if I'm speaking English here--
What's up? He's waiting for me. Hold up. Hold up.
What the hell, man?
Get off of me. Hey, Goodman. Get out here.
Hey. Yo, get your goon off me.
Not him, moron. Drop.
Leave it. Go lie down. Sorry. You can't be too careful these days.
Come on, come on.
Lock the door, Frisky. Jesus.
Take a break, H.T. Let's go.
Stop calling me that or I'll hang you by your tie.
Yeah, yeah. Stop showing off for the client.
Honey Tits. I say it's endearing.
So, what's so important?
Well, they're here. The end times, kid.
End times.
What does that mean?
Why'd you drag me here for?
You want your money, don't you? I assume that you do.
That couldn't wait?
Ever hear of the expression, "A fart in the wind"?
Inside of an hour, that will be me, I'm hitting the road. I'm out of here.
What, for, like, good? For as long as it takes.
I don't like my heat so hot, if you catch my drift.
I'm not catching anything you're saying.
What is your problem?
You haven't talked to your partner? Not since last night.
Today, he didn't show up to work and the DEA just happened to raid us.
Yeah, some coincidence, huh?
Yeah, I don't know about that.
All l know is when he tells me that your employer took him out,
threatening to murder his family, I take notice.
Because after all, what am I, if not family?
What are you talking about? When did that happen?
Uh-- I don't know. Forget it.
I mean, he exaggerates, right? He does that.
Hey, listen. Do me a favor.
Put in a good word for me with Fring. I mean, just for old time's sake.
I can't afford to butter the wrong bread here.
Yeah?
Hey.
Nothing, huh?
Clean as a whistle,
so he says.
You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name, number and the reason for your call. Thank you.
It's me again.
I really wish you'd pick up.
Um...
God, I just, um...
Call me back, okay?
Just, um...
Just call me back, please.
Hi. I'm sorry. ls it okay if l come out here for a few minutes?
Sure. Just stay up here, if you would.
Okay.
Excuse me.
I wonder if you have a-- An extra cigarette.
I sure could use a smoke right about now.
Sure.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Hey, what's up?
What?
Hey. Hey.
What's wrong with him?
What hospital?
Andrea.
Jesse.
Where's Brock? Inside. Grandma's with him.
They got me filling all this paperwork. How is he doing? Tell me.
The doctors, they don't know what it is exactly.
It's like he's got the flu.
But he just keeps getting worse.
Jesse, l don't understand.
He was fine this morning.
He was fine.
Andrea Cantillo? Right here.
Miss Cantillo, we're gonna go admit your son to the Pediatric lCU.
You can bring that with you. Okay.
Sir, you're the boy's father? No.
Okay. Sorry. lt's just we try to keep it to two visitors maximum.
Go, go, go. I'll be out here if you need me. Go. Go ahead.
No.
No, no.
No. No. No.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
No. No!
Andrea!
Andrea.
Hey. No yelling. I need to--
We can't have you here. I need to talk to her.
I need to tell her-- Take this outside.
My son is sick in here. No, just-- Come here.
Jesse...
What is it?
Jesse, l can't go out. My son's in here.
Okay. I'm thinking Brock may have been poisoned, okay?
What?
There's this stuff, this stuff called ricin.
Sounds like rice. You need to tell the doctors about it.
What? How do you know?
Doesn't matter. Just tell them it's a guess. Okay?
Ricin. They'll know what you're talking about.
Jesse, if there's something you're not saying, you have to tell me.
I gotta go. I gotta go see someone.
Jesse. I'm sorry, l gotta go.
Just tell them, okay?
Now. Just do it.
Hello. Could you buzz me in, please? Buzz me in!
What do you want?
We need to talk.
Who's with you? No one. Just me.
Let me in.
I don't know what you're thinking coming here.
Oh, Christ.
What does it matter?
Everything, it's all coming to an end.
Do you even know what's happening?
The full scope of what's happening?
They took me out into the desert.
They put a hood over my head
and drove me out into the desert on my knees.
They threatened my family, and not just Hank.
My wife, my children.
It's just a matter of time now.
I was able to protect them for now, but...
Gus is gonna make his move.
And I don't-- I don't know when.
I don't know where or how.
All l know is it's gonna happen.
And I'm powerless to stop him.
What are you doing?
Why did you do it?
Why? Jesse.
Gus gave me no choice.
I had to call the DEA to protect my family. What else could l do--?
No. No, you son of a bitch. You know what you did.
Okay, look, just--
Just put the gun down, okay?
Just put it down and we'll talk, all right?
You tell me what it is you think l did.
Brock.
Why did you poison him?
Who's Brock? You saw him in my living room.
You came and you looked right at him, so don't tell me you don't know him.
The boy?
Jesse, l have no idea who these people are.
Now, please.
Okay, that's Brock and he was poisoned?
The ricin.
He's dying because someone gave it to him.
And only you and l were the only two people on earth who knew about it.
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Maybe he went into your pockets--
No! I had it.
I had the cigarette with the ricin in my pack this morning.
The last time I saw Brock was last night.
And this morning, I switched the cigarette into a new pack.
There's no way Brock took it himself.
Jesse, you're not thinking clearly.
You said it yourself that you had it this morning.
When could l have possibly gotten it?
You had Saul do it.
What? Yeah.
Yeah. I went to his office.
He called me in, had to see me today.
His big bodyguard patted me down.
That's when he must have stole it off me. Right?
That's the plan? Was that the plan?
Jesse.
Why?
Why in God's name would I poison a child?
To get back at me.
Because l'm helping Gus,
and this is your way of ripping my heart out before you're dead and gone.
Just admit it.
Admit what you did. Admit it.
I did not do this! Shut up!
Stop lying!
Look, I'm not lying.
I'm not lying. Just listen to me. What would l have to gain?
What possible--? Possible could l--?
Who--? Who would--?
Oh, my God.
Hey.
Stop laughing.
Stop laughing!
I have been waiting--
I've been waiting all day,
waiting for Gus to send one of his men to kill me.
And it's you.
Who do you know who's okay with using children?
Jesse, who do you know who's allowed children to be murdered? Hm?
Gus.
He has been 1 0 steps ahead of me at every turn.
And now, the one thing that he needed to finally get rid of me is your consent.
And, boy, he's got that now. He's got it.
And not only does he have that,
he manipulated you into pulling the trigger for him.
No, only you and l knew about the ricin.
No, you don't even believe that.
Gus has cameras everywhere. Please.
Listen to yourself.
No, he has known everything all along.
Where were you today? In the lab?
You don't think it's possible that Tyrus lifted the cigarette out of your locker?
Come on.
Don't you see?
You are the last piece of the puzzle.
You are everything that he's wanted.
You're his cook now.
You're the cook and you have proven that you can run a lab without me.
And now that cook has reason to kill me.
Think about it.
It's brilliant.
So go ahead.
Go on.
If you think that I am capable of doing this, then go,
put a bullet in my head and kill me right now.
I'll do it. Do it!
Do it. I'll do it.
Do it.
Where are you going? Find the son of a bitch
and I'm gonna kill him. No.
Don't.
He'll see you coming.
You'll die before you get anywhere near him.
I don't care.
Jesse.
Jesse, just get in your car.
Just go.
Just drive.
No.
I'm going to do this one way or another, Mr. White.
Then let me help.
Ah, Jesus. Mr. Pinkman, I'm not gonna keep telling you.
Unless the family wants you in there, you're not allowed.
You can't keep coming in here like this.
You hear me?
You understand?
Mr. Pinkman, I'm gonna call security.
All right, here I go.
Come on now.
Mr. Pinkman, final warning.
Hey.
You need to be at work, now.
I already told you. I'm not going.
Got a batch that'll be ruined
and an employer who will be very upset if that happens.
And I could give a shit.
I'm not leaving here.
If my employer has a problem with that, he can tell me himself.
Not his errand boy.
Idiot.
Unh. Hey, I don't know this guy!
Call security! I'm being attacked!
Yeah.
That's right.
We've got a situation.
He'd like to speak with you.
I told you, I'm not leaving.
He's downstairs.
Tyrus told me what's happening.
The sick child.
I understand your preoccupation, but, Jesse, I am running a business.
I need you back at the lab to complete the cook.
You can return when you're done.
I can't.
It is, as you must know, in both of our best interests.
That little boy upstairs is dying.
I can't be away. I don't even wanna be here now.
I can't be away, if something happens, if he--
I am very sorry.
Is there anything I can do?
I am on the board of this hospital.
I can recommend doctors,
make sure he gets whatever he needs.
The best treatment.
He's not sick.
He was poisoned.
How did that happen?
The doctors,
they don't know.
This current batch
is surely ruined now, correct?
Stay with the boy.
Tyrus will dump what's there and clean the tanks.
You will start a new batch when you are ready to return.
Next week.
There you are.
Keep going.
Why did you stop?
Come on. Come on.
No, no, no. Don't go, don't go, don't go.
No. No.
Oh, shit.
No.

What did you say to Gus?
Because he's on to us. Yeah. What do you mean he's on to us?
He's walking to his car, then suddenly he isn't.
What, does he have a sixth sense?
Jesus. What did you say to him?
Could I ask my own question right now at this point?
Did you just bring a bomb into a hospital?
What, was I supposed to leave it on his car?
What, you're supposed to bring it to a hospital?
Oh, my God.
Look.
Where can we find Gus?
Name a place. One place
where l can surprise him, where he won't see me coming.
Because his house, the laundry,
the restaurant, factory farm, all wired with cameras.
One place.
Think. Jesse, think.
Where is it? Where?
Because if you can't tell me,
we are dead.
Jesse?
I don't-- I don't know.
Well, maybe--
Excuse me. Jesse Pinkman?
Uh, yeah. Hi. Detective Kalanchoe.
Detective Munn, Albuquerque Police.
We were wondering if we could have a few minutes. Go someplace and talk.
About what?
Sorry, l didn't catch your name. About what?
It concerns Brock Cantillo
and a statement you made to his mother.
How about you come with us?
We just wanna clear a few things up, no big deal.
So am l under arrest?
No, you're not under arrest.
We're just talking.
So if l get tired of talking, can I get up and leave?
We'd prefer you didn't.
You'd prefer. Yeah.
Jesse, why'd you tell Brock's mom that the boy had been poisoned?
Look, I think this has been, you know,
um, what do call it? Overblown.
Because all I basically said was,
"Have the doctors thought maybe Brock got poisoned?"
In a cover-all-bases kind of sense.
Yeah, I'm sure they appreciate that. You helping them out like that.
Especially how specific you were.
Ricin, wow.
Ricin, that's definitely a big one.
You don't see that every day.
So when doctors hear that, they take it very seriously.
As do we.
As does the FBI. Okay.
Nice, you trying to help out like that and all.
You know, professional courtesy, sharing your expertise.
Look, I ain't got no expertise, all right? I just, you know--
You happened to guess this rare poison
might be the thing that put this boy in the hospital.
Congratulations. Because his doctors, they think that you might just be right.
So why ricin? Jesse, how'd you come up with that?
I think I've-- l don't know, l must've saw it on House or something.
Huh. Yeah, you know, like, House
or the Discovery Channel.
Sometimes your brain just makes these connections.
Does it? Mine does.
That's interesting.
Look, I gotta get back.
But we're still talking.
So I'm not under arrest, but l can't leave.
So then, I guess
I should call my lawyer, right?
We're just having a simple conversation, Jess.
Why can't we keep talking, keep it light?
You know how it is when the lawyers get to it.
Suddenly, everything's a big pissing match.
Like, every time. Adversarial.
Adversarial. Then we gotta book you, blah-blah. Right?
I mean, you know. You've been around the block, Jesse.
You're no Boy Scout.
Saul Goodman.
That's my guy.
So do I gotta call him or do you?
What the hell are you doing?
I need Saul. Right now. So you break in?
You just break in. I see you're here.
If you'd answer the phone or the door, maybe l wouldn't-- Forget it.
Is he here?
Is that a serious question? Why would he be here?
But you know where he is. I need a number.
Look, let me explain something to you.
My partner and I-- Are in danger?
Whoopty-freakingdoo. Why do you think he's not here?
And how's that news, exactly, the two of you being in danger?
After doing something idiotic?
What gives you the right to break down my door?
Look, I just need a number, okay? That's all.
You are such a pain in my ass, you know that?
You're the reason I gotta go on unemployment.
I was looking forward to getting out of here.
But, no, now I gotta wait around all day
for a guy to come fix this door. Who pays for this?
Okay, you know what?
Here, look, I'm giving you everything. All of it, okay?
There's one, two...
Look, there's gotta be at least 1 700 dollars there, okay?
More than cover the cost of the door. Now, I apologize profusely.
Please. The phone number.
A door like this is gonna cost way more than 1 700.
What, for a plate of glass? No.
Oh, yeah. I bet it does.
I bet you it winds up costing...
20,000.
Are you insane?
Who the hell is going to charge $20,000 for a plate-glass door?
There's no reputable vendor would--
Oh.
Now l'm thinking 25.
I'll be right back.
Yes. Albuquerque, New Mexico.
The number of Rebecca Simmons, 306 Negra Arroyo Lane.
Would you connect it for me, please? Thank you.
Becky, hi. It's Walter White.
Listen, I wo--
I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Oh, good, good.
Yes, cats are...
Listen.
Skyler and l are out of town, on our way to Santa Fe,
and Junior just told us that he thinks
he may have left the burner on on the stove.
Yes, God forbid, there's a fire.
Well, that's why l'm calling. You se-- I just wanted to ask,
and I'm sorry to do this, but do you still have the key?
You do? Good. And would you be willing to--?
Oh, you are a lifesaver. Thank you so much. Yes.
Okay.
Okay. I'll await your call. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.
There you go.
Becky?
Oh...
Oh, that's good. That's a relief.
I owe you one. Bigtime.
So how's he doing?
You could at least say, instead of being a couple dicks about it.
Jesse, if you care at all about that little boy,
prove it to me.
Tell us what you know.
I told you what I know. Tell us again.
What are you, like, broken records?
I was trying to be helpful.
End of story.
Guess we'll wait and see what the tox screen says.
Look at this. Isn't this cozy? What'd you tell them?
I told them they're a couple of dicks.
He's a wordsmith.
Well, detectives, it's been a pleasure. Now, up you go,
make like you got manners, make like you respect the rule of law.
Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen, hasta luego, get the hell out.
Bye-bye. That's it, pick it up. Follow your partner.
And one-two.
Thank you.
Christ. You two--?
If I ever get anal polyps, I'll know what to name them.
Are you gonna get me out of here?
Ahh. Hmm.
No. Not even if l could.
You know, the FBI's gonna show up on this ricin thing
and then you're in it for the duration.
You're a lot safer in here.
They tried to get your partner in his own home.
Jesus.
Is he okay?
Well, he's okay like a fruit fly's okay.
Now, we're all on the clock here and thanks for that.
Wanna go stick your wangs in a hornet's nest, it's a free country.
But how come I always get sloppy seconds, huh?
You got anything for me? Tell me I didn't poke my head up for nothing.
Yeah.
I've been thinking...
And?
Casa Tranquila.
What's Casa Tranquila?
It's an old folks' home off Paseo Del Norte.
Our boy tells me Fring took him to visit one of the patients.
Someone Pinkman says you'll definitely remember:
Tio Salamanca.
Old guy in a wheelchair?
Ah, doesn't talk, rings a bell.
I mean, does that ring a bell?
The guy actually has to ring a bell. Yes, l know. l remember.
So, what, once every blue moon,
Gus goes and visits an old cartel associate.
That doesn't help me.
I can't hide out in a nursing home for six months,
hoping on the off chance that he comes back.
It's not even like they're friends.
Pinkman said it was like he was torturing the old guy.
What does that mean?
He told him the last of his family was dead. He enjoyed telling him.
Pinkman asked him about it. All Gus would say
was that this Tio character murdered someone close to him.
Wait. Tio murdered someone close to Gus?
I know, it sounds not particularly fruitful.
But, sorry, that's all I got.
They're enemies, not friends.
Next number in this cover-all game where you cover the whole shimoly
is B number three, like Goldilocks and the Three Bears.
That's number three in your B column.
Followed by O, seven, four,
that's O, 74, on the other side of your card.
Now we have that lucky number B, number seven.
Is it lucky for you?
B, seven.
In the I row, two, one.
I, 21 .
I know you despise me.
And I know how badly you wanna see me dead.
But l'm willing to bet that I know a man whom you hate even more.
Those N's just keep coming They're all sticking together.
I'm offering you an opportunity for revenge.
G column, four, eight,
the continental United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
Okay. I'm here.
How you doing this morning, Mr. Salamanca? You need something?
You need to go poopie, huh?
Did you go poopie already? No?
What do you need?
You want me to get the board for you?
Okay.
All right.
Okay. Here we go.

I don't think we're finished, Mr. Salamanca. A, E, I, O, U.
Finish the word, Mr. Salamanca.
Is it "dear?"
Is it "deal?"
Honey, "dea" ain't a word. Help me out here.
Hey, son, what's up? When exactly are you getting here?
Uh, just as soon as I can.
Look, this is a serious situation and you're not taking it seriously.
Let me talk to him.
Son, l am taking this seriously. Give it to me, Walter.
I'm concerned about your Uncle Hank and his safety.
But whomever is making these threats against him,
I can assure you, there's absolutely no interest in me.
I'm not on anyone's radar.
And besides, your mother and l-- Give it to me. Walter.
Did you hear what he said? Get over here. No more excuses.
Marie, I will be there just as soon as l can.
I promise. Hold on.
You wanna weigh in here? Maybe you can talk sense into him?
Marie, he'll get here when he gets here so...
I hope you sell plenty of air fresheners.
I hope you have a banner day over there.
Okay, Walt, don't worry about a thing here. Goodbye.
And thank you for all of your help.
What's that?
Anything?
Hey, everyone.
Hi, Steve.
How's everybody holding out? The man l wanna see.
Come here. Look at this.
Jesus, enough with the laundry. No, no, no, hear me out.
This panel, if I'm reading it correctly, is 7200 amp service.
This place has two of them, right? That's a whole lot ofjuice, brother.
Laundry this size, typically, has half that, okay?
What's with the extra panel?
What are you, Thomas Edison? Asked a bunch of electricians.
They have their own chat rooms, all they talked about was wiring.
Freaking lnternet. Find anything on it these days.
What do you say? Pop over, have another look-see?
Listen.
I think we possibly have a lead on something.
Yeah? I have this guy down at the office.
He says he has some kind of information.
The thing is, he'll only give it to you, in person.
Okay.
Do you remember Hector Salamanca? Pfft, yeah.
The old cripple guy with the bell? Rather crap than talk to us?
No, I don't remember him at all. Why? Well, he's the guy.
His nurse calls us, says he wants to powwow.
So we have this guy at the office for three hours.
And he still just wants to talk to you.
Do not even think about going down there.
Marie-- This is clearly a ploy or a trick
or something designed to get Hank out into the open. That's all this is.
Well, that's what we thought.
Well...
It's been years since this guy's been a player.
His nephew's gone, doesn't have anybody.
The nurse checks out, don't know nothing.
Guess l just don't see an angle here,
if there even is one.
Of course, if you did wanna talk to this guy,
there's no safer place than the office.
I don't think this sounds like a good idea.
Yeah. I agree, Uncle Hank.
It is a ridiculous idea.
And there's no way that you're going to do it. End of story.
Hank, thanks for coming down.
No problem at all.
Good to see you, sir.
So, Mr. Salamanca, you got something you wanna tell me?
A, E, l, O--
Row O. P, Q, R, S--
First letter S.
A, E, l, O, U--
Second letter U. A--
B, C--
A, E, l--
J, K--
A, E, l--
J, K, L, M--
A, E, l, O, U--
Row U. V, W, X, Y--
All right. That's enough.
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks. I can spell.
Well, you got that out of your system now?
Should we try this one more time?
A, E--
F--
A, E, l, O, U--
A--
B, C--
Yeah, we got it.
I am-- I am-- I am just so, so sorry.
Well, at least this time, he didn't shit himself.
I guess that's progress.
Yes?
We may have a problem.
I've got eyes on the DEA.
They just had a visitor.
Hector Salamanca.
I don't know what to say to you now.
Sit here and think about how far that kind of behavior is gonna get you.
Not far, let me tell you.
Any second thoughts?
Then let's get to work.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Ooh. Oh.
Mr. Pinkman,
you're free to go.
Why? What happened?
Tox screen came back.
No ricin poisoning.
Surprised, huh?
No, why should I be?
Your jacket.
Till we meet again.
Okay. Okay.
Hey, yo. Yo, right here.
Oh-- Hey, Andrea.
Um, l'm just checking on Brock.
Hey, it sounds like...
I mean, listen, just call me if you can, all right?
I'm heading back over. All right. Hey, excuse me.
Yes.
We just picked up Pinkman.
No witnesses.
What about Hector?
I've checked inside and out,
no wires, no camera, no surveillance.
Police cruiser rolled through an hour ago. Seemed routine.
It's just him, alone in his room.
All right.
I'm on my way.
Maybe it's better if, uh-- If I do this myself.
I do this.
It's all clear.
Wait here.
What kind of man talks to the DEA?
No man.
No man at all.
A crippled little rata.
What a reputation to leave behind.
Is that how you want to be remembered?
Last chance to look at me, Hector.
Oh, my--
All right, all right.
Let's get going.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
Why don't we start evacuating?
Start evacuation on the south side.
Call Security.
Everyone outside right now.
-in the same boat for sure.
But it's that time again,
where we tell you about your own hell,
Albuquerque afternoon commute. How bad are things out there?
I tell you what, right now southbound 25, got an accident at Jefferson.
Make sure you stay to the left through that area.
Things have slowed to a crawl at the Big I, no surprises there either.
Hate to interrupt, I have breaking news.
Now, coming out of the North Valley,
an explosion has been reported at a nursing home.
Casa Tranquila nursing home.
Oh, no.
You heard of that place.
We got few details on it so far.
Unfortunately, initial report is though, that three people may have been killed.
Oh, no.
The news is disturbing.
We're gonna get you information as soon as it comes in.
Situation over there is pretty hectic. What's traffic looking like?
If you're moving through that area,
we're talking about East and Westbound Paseo, North Valley.
Please, avoid that area as you move through.
Our heart's going out to the victims.
We'll bring you details as we get them.
Coming up on Coyote 1 02.5, Aerosmith, Def Leppard.
Keep it right here on New Mexico's finest rock--
You wanna cook with a broken arm?
Next step, CO2.
Do it.
Hey.
I better hear them click.
What, you got a problem with stairs?
Gus is dead.
We've got work to do.
Uh, he's gonna pull through.
Yeah?
Yeah. It looked kind of touch-and-go there for a while,
but he's gonna...
He's gonna make it.
Oh, thank God.
You know, still saying it wasn't the ricin.
I don't understand.
Then what was it?
Saying it was most likely a flower called lily of the valley.
It's, like, common.
It's got these red berries on it that I guess taste sweet
and sometimes kids eat them and wind up poisoning themselves.
And that's it, nothing more.
So Gus didn't poison him after all.
Still he...
He, uh-- He had to go, right?
Damn right.
Gus had to go.
Yeah.
Um, you know, l should--
I should get back.
Andrea's waiting.
I'm at Casa Tranquila where three are dead
following an explosion that rocked this facility earlier today.
The fireball completely consumed one resident's room
and damaged common areas nearby.
Walt?
Let me get somewhere where l can hear you.
Tell him Uncle Hank was right. Walt?
How you doing?
How am l doing? How are you doing?
I'm, uh...
I'm doing quite well.
I'm good.
Jesus, Walt, the news here.
Gus Fring is dead.
He was blown up with some person from some Mexican cartel
and the DEA has no idea what to make of it.
Do you know about this?
Walt? l need you to-- It's over.
We're safe.
might've heard a rumbling sound,
and another reported a, quote, "ringing" in the moments just prior.
Administrators at Casa Tranquila advise
that if you do have loved ones in their care, please do not call in...
Was this you?
What happened?
I won.
âª We touched the walls Of the city streets âª
âª And dead ends plain Sadly showed us our ways âª
âª Of never asking why âª
âª Cast down, it was heaÎ½en-sent âª
âª And to the church No intent to repent on my knees âª
âª Just to cry âª
âª Until you travel to âª
âª That place you can't come back âª
âª Where the last painting's gone âª
âª And all that's left is black âª
âª Lookin' up at those stars In the sky âª
âª Those white clouds Have turned it black âªâª
ï»¿1
So how's it look?
Meaning, do l see it?
Yes.
Do you see it?
Basically, any lawman worth his salt is gonna spot that, yeah.
Assuming that's a deal breaker?
Yes, it's a deal breaker.
Well, if stealth is what you're aspiring to,
you best go with something more compact.
Thirty-eight Special.
Snub nose.
Got a concealed hammer
so it don't catch on your belt when you draw.
Tried and true. No nonsense about it.
Five shots. Yeah.
Automatic has how many?
Ten in the mag, one in the chamber.
If you can't get it done with five, you're into spray and pray,
in which case, l wouldn't count on another six closing the deal.
You load that with 1 58-grain hollow points
instead of standard wadcutters, it's got plenty of stopping power.
Can't get more dependable than a wheel gun.
Try it on with this.
That snubbie will conceal up real nice if you carry it IWB.
Little harder to draw from, but there's no substitute
if you're intent on fooling a vigilant eye.
Comes in polymer too.
I prefer the feel of leather.
Old school, I guess.
Well, um...
Sure it's on the correct side?
If you're right-handed, it is.
I don't know, ma-- Are you sure?
Maybe it'll feel better on the left side.
General rule, you don't wanna cross-draw.
Not unless you're gonna be sitting.
You know, store clerks, card gamers and such.
Uh-huh.
Either way, you're gonna wanna practice your draw. A lot.
Because if you're all fingers,
well, it might could be him keeping the peace instead of you.
Catch my drift?
What's this?
That is why you're gonna pay me five times
what you'd pay your neighborhood gun store.
Serial number's been filed off.
So to state the obvious,
I don't wanna be caught with this on me.
No. To state the obvious, you don't.
You know, mister, l've been providing my services for the past 30-odd years.
You'd think I'd learn better than to ask a man his business,
especially not one referred by the lawyer.
But l do feel the urge to ask you,
are we strictly talking defense here?
Yes, absolutely.
Defense.
Why?
Because if it's just personal protection,
aside from a bucket of money,
you'd save yourself a potential felony two-spot
for carrying a weapon with a defaced serial number if you buy it legally.
But if you did have to use it, wouldn't it still be better to use one
that couldn't be traced?
This is the West, boss.
New Mexico's not a retreat jurisdiction.
Man steps to you bent on doing you harm,
you got every right to plant your feet and shoot to kill.
Some call it a moral right, and I do include myself within that class.
All this to say, I'm happy to take your money.
But if you're not a convicted felon,
you might best be advised to bear your arms
within the confines of the law.
It's for defense.
Defense.
I'll take it.
Thanks, Bonnie.

Kind of, like, just wanna stare at them.
Heh. Yeah, man, totally makes me wanna crank old Sabbath and blaze one.
It's got, like, parametric equalization.
Automatically adjusts the levels to changes in air pressure and whatnot.
It's totally digital.
Vacuum tube amp, which is, by far, the best, anti-distortion-wise.
Hits 1 20 decibels without breaking a sweat.

Left 4 Deae, yo. Bitches get all cranial when you cap them in the head. It's like, "Booyah!"
No, no, no, man. Resieent Evil 4 takes it by a long shot.
Oh, please, brother. You're fronting. No, seriously.
That chick, the one you gotta rescue? She's smoking, bro.
And then you're, like, the last undead dude on earth.
How can you not be dipping into that?
Talk about inspiring a brother to kick zombie ass.
They're trying to eat your brain. A dude don't need no more motivation.
Fair point, l guess.
Okay, okay, okay.
Call of Duty: World at War, zombie mode.
Now, that's the bomb, man. Think on it, bro.
They're not just zombies. They're Nazi zombies.
Nazi zombies. Pssh.
Yeah, man. SS Waffen troopers too,
which are like the baddest ass Nazis of the whole Nazi family.
What difference does it make what their job was when they was living?
Dude, you are so historically retarded.
Nazi zombies don't wanna eat you just because they're craving the protein.
They do it because--
They do it because they hate Americans, man.
Talibans. They're the Talibans of the zombie world.
I played the game. They ain't exactly fleet of foot.
I'm saying, where's the challenge?
The zombies in Left 4 Deae clock a respectable 40.
You gotta lead them. They're not even zombies.
They're just infected.
They got, like, this rage virus,
amps them up like they been smoking the schwag.
Apples and oranges, bro. Totally unfair to compare the two.
âª You ain't nothin' But a hoochie mama âª
Yo, Jesse, where do you come out on all this?

You okay?
Fine.
Can't you sleep?
Actually, yes, Marie. This is me sleeping. What's it look like?
It looks like you're looking at a rock...
at 2:24 in the morning.
This is not a rock, this is a mineral, for, like, the 1 0th time.
Okay.
Got it.
Blue corundum, to be precise.
Blue corundum. Well, it's very pretty.
It's encrusted with igneous biotite in a mica schist.
Would you like some more detail? Because l can give it to you.
You can keep acting like you give the first shit--
Hank.
Found in the Central Cordillera of lrian Jaya.
Blue corundum.
I'm just saying...
It's 2 in the morning.
I'm just asking if maybe--
You know, last I counted, Marie, there were four bedrooms in this house.
You know, I mean, if l'm keeping you awake and all.
You've reached Walter White.
Please state your name,
number and reason for your call. Thank you.
Walt?
Hello? Walt?
Okay, Walt, could you call me back, please?
Hank's bills are really starting to pile up here.
And in the meantime,
I haven't received a check from you in quite a while.
Second order of business is the car wash.
Unh! God! So it's time to take the next step here.
We need to look into buying this car wash while we--
Skyler, what are you doing?
What do you mean?
Wait, are you screening all my calls? No, no, no, I'm just--
What are you thinking leaving a message like that on my machine?
What are you--? What did I say?
You just left recorded proof of our intention to buy a car wash.
Now, you think that was wise? Proof of our what?
What are you talking about?
Skyler, we should not even be mentioning the words "car wash"
on the phone at all. Period.
Walt, it is a car wash, not a brothel.
I mean, if we can't even say what it is, why are we buying it at all?
Ugh, God, look, Skyler, please, just--
Hey, Mom. Hey, hon.
Look, there's some cereal on the breakfast table.
I'm telling you,
if you're not willing to pull the trigger,
I'm more than happy to call Goodman myself.
No, no, no, I will handle it, okay?
I could so use a brain transplant right now.
Yeah. I'm going to work.
Wake up, bitch. Huh!
Damn.
Argh.
You're way too sensitive about your zone, bro.
Argh. Come on, man. Clean-up time.
Right on. Least we can do.
Hey, the hell with cleaning up.
Just go out and get everybody some breakfast.
Stock up on liquor while you're at it. Keep this party going.

What's the count?
Two-oh-one point six.
Give it a second weigh, if you would, please.
New policy.
What, Walter?
Where's Gus? Why?
Because l would like to speak with him.
Because the way we left things, I would like the chance to clear the air.
Hm.
What?
Walter, you're never gonna see him again.
Oh, look who woke up hungry.
Are you hungry?
Yeah, that's good. Drink that up.
Just a little longer, okay, my sweetie?
Okay?

You're almost there, Hank.
All right, buddy. That's what I call kicking some ass.
Oh, that was awesome, babe. Ha.
Hells, yeah! Very nice.
Yeah!
Hey!
You're a good man, Chuck. Thanks.
It's an honor, my friend.
Same time tomorrow?
Damned straight,
if l'm still alive.
Great session.
Lots of positive energy.
Lots.
It's just-- It's so great to see that.
It's just...
Yeah.
One day at a time.
All we can do.
I know. It's just...
You've got a real way with him.
It's...
You wanna go full time? We've got a spare bedroom.
Heh. I'll see you tomorrow.
Wow, you were so strong today.
Did you work up an appetite? I'm sure you did.
Listen, I was thinking about cooking tonight, so--
Marie.
Get out.
âª Get down âª
Oh, yo, about time.
Oh, my God.
Yo, what's up with the pie, man? It ain't cut.
Yeah, right. That's the gimmick. What gimmick?
This place, they don't cut their pizza, they pass the savings on to you.
How much can it be to cut a damn pizza?
Maybe it's, like, democratic, bro.
You know, cut your own Christmas tree, cut your own pizza.
Yeah, it's democratic.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Don't sweat it.
You got some, like, scissors?
I will cut this bitch up good.
Yo, come in.
Hey, would you...?
Gotta figure, you make, like, 1 0 million pizzas a year.
Each pizza takes, like, 1 0 seconds to cut.
In man-hours, that's...
I don't know.
Heh, heh, heh. A lot.
Hey, Jesse?
Huh?
You got, um...
Yeah.
âª Get down âª
So, uh, how you doing?
I'm dealing.
How's Brock?
Good. He's, uh...
Brock, honey, wait in the car, okay? Let the grown-ups speak.
Go on, little man.
We'll catch up later.
Guess you know I've been calling.
Yeah. Um--
I'm really busy at work and...
Jesse, l'm not here to make you come up with excuses.
You got other things going on. I get it.
There's just one thing you and me gotta talk about.
And that's this.
After Tomas was murdered, two dudes,
bangers he used to hang with, get run over.
One of them shot in the head. Same night, I get this in my mailbox.
This was you?
You know what?
Whatever it is you had to do with my brother's killers, I don't wanna know.
But you gotta tell me one thing:
Is someone gonna come looking for this?
No.
What exactly am I supposed to do with this?
Use it to get you and Brock out of that shit hole of a neighborhood.
Or you can go out and spend it on glass
and I'd have no way of stopping you.
But l gotta believe you won't do that.
Whoo!
âª Get down âªâª
Go home, Walter.
How you doing?
Hi.
Ton of bricks?
Rocks.
You, uh, want me to wheel them inside?
Thank you.
Marie, is that my minerals?
Yes, Hank.
How many boxes?
I don't know. Three, four hundred.
A million.
I don't know.
Did you check them for damage?
Oh, my God.
They're rocks, Hank. No, they're minerals.
Jesus, Marie. I got some geodes coming that are very delicate, all right?
I'll not accept any boxes that have damage.
Those delivery jagoffs, I'm not getting ass-raped by those bastards.
Just...
Honey, would you check?
Just check, please?
Hey, you, too much wax.
Stop wasting it.
Look, tell your brother that if he doesn't show up tomorrow
I'm gonna have to fire him. So now, go back.
And no more excuses.
Mr. Wolynetz, my name is Skyler White.
How do you do?
You wanna buy my car wash? I do.
And I am prepared to talk numbers right now, if you'd like.
You think this is an easy job?
You are willing to get down on your hands and knees
and scrub like a housemaid,
with all the chemicals eating into your nice skin
and stinging in your eyes?
Well, I know a thing or two about scrubbing.
Any other advice for me? Because l am serious about this.
Good.
I am serious too.
I have worked 30 years on building this business from nothing,
with my own hands and my own sweat and blood.
I can appreciate that. Truly.
So with that in mind,
is there a figure you can quote me?
One which you think would--
Ten million dollars.
Well, let's try 879,000.
Where do you come up with this number? You pull it from your behind?
On a typical day, you average 1 9 cars per hour.
Extrapolating, l added the extra revenues for hand waxes and detailing.
Subtracted your overhead in salary,
maintenance, operating fees, depreciation,
which I obtained from businesses in the Albuquerque area,
giving me an estimate of your annual cash flow here.
I applied industry-standard multiplier, added market value of your real estate.
Giving me a total estimated value of $829,000.
On top of which I generously added an extra $50,000.
So as not to be insulting.
Twenty million dollars.
Okay, Mr. Wolynetz, this--
This is the price for Walter White.
Ah.
Oh, yes. You don't think I know who you are?
I remember.
Well, I have not pretended to be a-- Your husband,
he quit without giving me notice.
He broke my air fresheners, he cursed at me and grabbed himself.
And now he wants to buy my car wash.
But he's not man enough to come in here and face me himself.
Instead he sends his woman. Excuse me.
Walter White wants to buy my car wash.
The price he pays is 20 million dollars.
Now, please leave.
Have you recently lost a loved one in an aviation disaster?
Have you suffered injury, shock to the senses
or property damage as a result of airplane debris
or, God forbid, falling body parts?
Then call me, Saul Goodman.
It goes without saying, that the six, seven,
perhaps eight-figure cash settlement that l can win for you
will never fill the hole in your heart caused by your tragic loss.
But you deserve justice.
So if you want to tip the scales back in your favor,
better call Saul.
Saul Goodman, attorney-at-law. 505-503-4455.
We are just about ready to go...
You might wanna learn how to tail better
if you're planning on making a habit of it.
May I buy you a drink?
Next round, when you're done.
Why not? You make a hell of a lot more than l do.
Another round for him, and I'll have the same.
No ice.
I feel like I need to explain myself.
There were some actions that I took which I want you to understand.
I didn't want any of this to happen.
Everything l did, I did out of loyalty to my partner.
And then, later,
of course,
purely out of self-defense.
I hope you can appreciate that.
Just like I appreciated that...
I appreciate that when you were going to kill me,
you were simply following orders. I get that. Completely.
And I harbor no ill will.
Well, there's a load off my mind.
Mike, I'm trying to tell you-- I get it.
Fine.
Drink up, Walter.
Hell of a last couple of weeks.
Makes a man wonder exactly where he stands.
I mean, I cannot be alone in feeling this way.
Not after what happened to Victor.
So, what's with the piece?
Right hip, inside your waistband.
I noticed it the other day at the lab. You wear it if it makes you feel better.
But if push comes to shove, it's not gonna help.
Mike, do I have to come right out and say this?
You and I...
we're in the same boat.
Drink your drink.
If it happened to Victor, it could happen to you.
And what the hell was that, anyway? Hm?
A message?
He cuts a man's throat just to send a message?
You won, Walter.
You got the job.
Do yourself a favor and learn to take yes for an answer.
Yeah, I got the job.
But for how long?
Get me in a room with him.
Mike, just get me in a room,
and I'll do the rest.
You done?
Yeah.
Whoa.
Thanks for the drink.
âª Paid a fee Door, let me get in free âª
Pinkman, man, you know how to party, brother.
Epic. Epic.
Seriously?
Where you two going?
Jesse, l've been awake for, like, three straight days.
I'm turning into a Sleestak.
So crash here.
It's not like I ain't got the space.
Yeah, that's cool and all, but l think I got, like, this cat.
Think I'm, like, supposed to feed it.
Whatever, you little bitch. What about you?
You sticking or do I gotta flip you over, check you for a slizz?
Bro, l'm kind of pushing flowers here, yo.
I ain't proud of it, but it's God's honest truth.
Hell, brother, you know we got mad love for you.
Now that you're back in the mix, it's, like, nothing but good days ahead.
Plenty of time to pace it out, is all l'm saying.
Yeah, man.
Totally.
I was thinking, like, next week?
Yeah, sure, man. Next week.
We cool?
We are cool.

Son of a...
I'm not leaving.
Walt, I'm not leaving.
Oh, my God.
Ah. l can hear your cell phone ringing!
This is ridiculous. I can't...
Ah. Uh-- What is going on with you? I've left you, like, 23 messages.
And? And?
We need to talk about the car wash.
Skyler, now is not a good time for me, okay?
Can we talk about this later? No, okay? We can't.
Why are you doing--?
Oh, Jesus.
What happened? Nothing. l just bumped it. That's all.
Okay, I'm-- I'm coming in.
Okay.
Exactly what happened?
It's complicated and I don't wish to discuss it.
It's none of your concern. Are you in danger?
Walt.
Walt, I need you to look me in the eye and tell me right now.
Are you in danger? You know what?
Let's just say that l have a hell of a lot more on my mind right now
than thinking about buying a damn car wash.
Okay?
So if you could just--
Please.
Okay.
Okay. Then we go to the police.
What? We tell them everything.
That you're a drug dealer
afraid for your safety and the safety of your family
and you need help. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What choice is there? What choice?
If you're in danger, then it would be--
Wait, wait, stop, stop. Stop.
You keep saying that word. "Danger." "Danger."
But you said-- No, I have never used that word.
I said "complicated," and then you flew off the handle.
Yeah, I flew off the handle when l saw that.
Okay? Where'd that come from? Hm?
A fall in the shower? Uh--
This is just so passive-aggressive, you know.
Passive-aggressive?
I go two days without returning your phone calls, two days,
and I have one minor little incident, and now you're telling me
that I should turn myself in to the police!
A minor incident? Yes.
What minor little incident?
I had an argument with a co-worker, okay?
And?
I had an argument.
We were in this bar
and we were discussing a particular business strategy.
And it got heated and out of control, and he hit me. Once.
And I didn't retaliate because he's a much older man.
And that's it.
You were in a bar fight?
Yes, Skyler. I was in a bar fight.
So you're okay?
Really?
Yes.
I'm okay.
And I think, in the end, that it may have been a good thing
because we were able to clear the air and, you know--
Mutual respect, and...
So...
Frozen peas.
What? It's the best thing for the swelling.
Oh, it's not really swollen, it's just--
No peas.
You don't even have ice.
I will get peas, I will get ice. Peas and ice, I'm writing it down.
I, um...
I need you to promise me
that if things do get dangerous--
Skyler-- Promise me.
Absolutely.
So...
Car wash.
âª Trouble Kiss me again âª
âª 'Cause I'm hoping you are âª
âª Press it right there And I'll pay you back double âª
âª But this ain't the real thing Look at my lips âª
Honey. Charles.
âª Look at my teeth They're just aching to bite âª
Take a look at this kitchen.
âª lt's a big empty chasm âª
Hi there. Can l answer any questions?
Yes. Any chance of a top-off?
Oh, I think we can help you out there.
âª You've got compassion Coming out of your ears âªâª
So, what do you think?
Oh, very nice. Very open.
Oh, I agree. It flows. Mm.
Whole lot of natural light.
Michael Kilbourne.
Tori Costner. It's nice to meet you.
Well, three bedrooms, one and a half baths on just under half an acre.
There's a non-attached casita out in back.
Permit usable as office or guest suite.
Hm. Plank wood floors.
Central heat and air.
I see you're married.
No, divorced.
Very recent.
Old habits. Heh. Oh, I'm sorry.
But any children? Yes, as a matter of fact. A little boy.
Oh, how old?
He turned 4 in May. He's a Gemini. Would love this yard.
Oh, plenty of space for a jungle gym.
And the neighborhood preschool is fantastic.
I think Eli is going to be homeschooled.
Oh, well, great. Not for religious reasons.
I wanna make sure he's getting attention.
He'll still go to summer camp and whatnot, playdates.
Don't want him to be socially awkward. Oh, no. Makes sense.
He tests very highly, 96 percentile.
But that whole right brain, left brain. You want those in balance.
Oh, yeah.
You said the casita has plumbing?
I work a lot with clay, so I need access to running water.
Well, it's pipe-fitted for a quarter bath so...
Make a perfect studio.
Hm.
This could work.
Heh, heh. Hell, that's the doctor's plan to get her patients at ease.
If you know what l mean.
But, nurse--
Hello? l'm back.
That's okay.
Hank?
Yeah.
I had to go to three places to get the moisturizer that you like.
But l got that.
And I got your Shiner Bock and your chips.
And I couldn't resist.
The complete encyclopedia to fantasy football.
Look, it has all the latest rankings. Marie, I said Cheetos, not Fritos.
Wait, I...
I said Cheetos, like, 1 0 times. You need me to write it down?
No, and I don't need you to be mean about it either.
Well, I'm just saying, you know, I said Cheetos. "Ch," "ch," "ch" sound.
Virtually impossible to confuse Cheetos with Fritos, seems to me.
Where are you going? I-- Back to the store, I guess.
Here.
And the draft's not for two months, so this is useless.
Can you believe it?
What?
What? This.
Well, you always said this place could be bugged.
Now we know. Yeah, well.
I don't like it.
It's a violation of the work space.
Yeah, I guess.
You wanna do something?
Do something?
Like what?
Go-karts?
Go-karts. What--?
Yeah, there's a track down by the Coliseum.
It's pretty fun.
No, actually l have some kind of a meeting, so...
All right, whatever.
Rain check?
Yeah. Sure.
How you doing?
Good. Yeah?
You okay?
Is there, uh, anything we should talk about?
How's your eye?
Yeah, it's fine.
Anything we should talk about?
For what it's worth,
getting the shit kicked out of you...
not to say you get used to it...
but you do kind of get used to it.
Two words: nail salon.
Perfect for money laundering.
It's a high-volume business with a discreet work force.
I mean, nobody does, "Mister, me know nothing"
better than Mrs. Mookjaiaporn and her gals.
Mr. Goodman--
"Saul," please.
Now, for the lady of the house.
Drum roll. How about a lifetime supply
of French manicures and enzyme peels?
Oh, yeah, go ahead. Pinch yourself. Ha-ha-ha.
We're not buying a nail salon, Mr. Goodman.
We're getting the car wash. I'm sorry.
Am l missing something here? Didn't you already try that?
Yeah. I mean, Walt told me that you took a run at this Bogdan character
and he wrestled you into submission with his eyebrows.
Ten million, that was the asking price, right?
Apparently, he upped it to 20.
Wow. Nice negotiating. Yeah, l mean, hey, you bombed. It happens.
You were smart to call me. Now--
You just sit back, relax, and let a professional take over.
That's for me. Excuse me.
What do you want? I'm in a meeting.
Why didn't you think of that before? It's not my--
I'm in a meeting.
Can Huell use your bathroom?
Huell?
Uh, sure. The top of the stairs.
He'll be quick.
It's a stomach thing. It's...
So where were we?
Professionalism. Yeah.
So if the guy won't sell, he won't sell.
I don't accept that. I don't accept that he won't sell.
I think he just lacks the proper...
motivation.
Motivation. Ah.
As in "motivation" motivation? l mean, just so we're on the same page here,
are you saying we make him an offer he can't refuse?
Nothing so dramatic as that, no.
Motivation.
Attitude adjustment.
This one, she's a keeper.
Well, an audit can be highly motivating.
I know a gal at Tax and Revenue.
You give her 1 0 minutes, she'll have his sky raining frogs.
No, we don't want to draw any unwanted tax attention.
We don't want them looking at us after Bogdan sells.
All right, how about an lCE raid?
He's got illegals working over there. He has to.
We are not getting a bunch of poor, innocent people in trouble, no.
Yeah, and also you're gonna need them after you take over.
Hey, how about terrorism?
"Oh, Agent Hoover, l gotta tell you,
I've seen some real 'Islamic' comings and goings over there at the car wash.
Yeah, I mean, guys in turbans pulling up in vans and stuff like that." Ha, ha.
Saul, Bogdan is Romanian.
Okay, well, we're just spitballing here, so...
Okay, there's always:
"You got a real nice place here.
Be a shame if something happened to it." That angle.
What are you talking about?
Violence?
Attitude adjustment.
Oh, no. That, no.
That is not at all what I meant. I-- We do not do that.
That's not who we are, right?
Yeah, no, no, no. She's right.
Look, do I need to state the obvious?
I mean, there's gotta be dozens of car washes in this area.
Who says it has to be this one?
I do.
I say it has to.
Why?
I just do.
God.
Well, that clears things up.
I don't like him. Bogdan. Oh.
He was condescending to me, rude about you, and I do not like him.
Simple as that.
Hey, nobody appreciates a passionate woman more than I do.
But in this business--
And Walt can back me up on this.
-the number one rule is don't take things personally.
What do you mean, rude about me?
Something along the lines of you weren't man enough
to face him yourself.
What? That you had to send your woman
to do your business for you. Ha, ha.
Speaking as your lawyer, I'm gonna go on record and say this is a bad idea.
Now, I advise against-- It's this one. lt's this one.
Okay, so, uh...
All we have to do is think of a non-violent, unsuspicious way
to purchase the car wash, that protects the innocents
and doesn't cost $20 million.
Don't everybody speak at once.
I like it. Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Hi.
Can l answer any questions?
Oh. Spoons. Yes, the owner is quite the collector.
Aren't they something? One for each of the 50 states.
Puerto Rico is technically a territory. Huh.
You know, maybe they were thinking, "Someday."
So no basement?
No basement. Sorry. That's a problem.
My brother's in the Peace Corps and won't be back for 1 8 months
and I said I'd hang on to his furniture.
Well, if you're looking for storage space, there's an attic area.
Oh. Well, an attic might be even better, as long as it's dry.
Let's take a tour. Okay.
Actually, I have a handout for you.
It has all the information.
I'm Stephanie Doswell, by the way. Charlotte Blattner.
So nice to meet you, Charlotte. You too.
So I told him point-blank.
You're my husband and I love you, but you're 53 years old.
This job has just gotten too stressful and difficult, and it's time to quit.
And, miracle of miracles, he listened.
What a fascinating career that must have been for him.
It was.
I mean, NASA was like a second family to us,
but, you know, it was time for a new adventure.
So between his pension and the income I bring in from hand modeling,
we're, you know, comfortable. When were these floors redone?
Two years ago. The counters are brand-new.
I can tell. Travertine.
Nice.
Any children? No.
I don't really want kids.
Is that horrible for me to say? Not at all.
Not everyone has to have children.
You should talk to my husband. Ha, ha.
Garbage disposal?
âª This will never end 'Cause I want more âª
âª More, give me more Give me more âª
âª This will never end 'Cause I want more âª
Check it out. Score, yo.
âª Give me more âª
Come on. Come on. What you got?
You're going down!
âª If I had a heart I could love you âª
âª If I had a voice I would sing âª
âª After the night when l wake up âª
âª l'll see what tomorrow brings âª
âª If l had a voice I would sing âªâª
I really love your home.
Oh, well, thank you, Mimi.
It has a very European feel.
You think?
Oh, I lived in London for years,
so, yeah, this feels familiar.
Where in London? I was stationed at Upwood in the '60s.
Downtown, but we were almost never there.
My husband is an illustrator. We traveled a lot. Paris, Italy, Denmark.
It was before the kids were in school, so it was easy to pick up and go.
That was before my youngest, Lucy, was diagnosed with endocarditis.
Oh, my. Gosh, is that--?
It's a bacterial infection of the heart valves. It's...
Yeah, it can be...
Oh, that's terrible.
Is she all right?
Your daughter. Is she okay?
Yes. Thank you. Um--
The doctors put in a prosthetic valve, so she's-- Lucy's fine.
Running and walking, riding horses.
Thank goodness.
Yeah.
We're very lucky.
Excuse me, miss. Very nice, thank you.
I just called the police. Okay, then.
I know you stole that spoon.
What are you talking about?
You're a thief.
Excuse me? And a liar.
Making stories up. What's wrong with you?
No, what's the matter with you?
You better just back off, okay?
My husband is a DEA agent. Oh, I thought he was an astronaut.
Or an illustrator. Get your crazy lies straight.
You know what, fatty? You are so lucky
that I am late for an appointment. You're not going anywhere.
Let go of my purse!
Not until the police get here.
Let it go!
Let it go! Let it go!
You are in big trouble.
Yeah.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just slow-- Hey, just-- Slow down. Start from the-- You're--
You're where?
Why the f--?
Why are you--?
Are you seriously doing this to me again?
Jesus, just--
Would you stop crying?
I'll make a phone call. Just sit tight.
Where they got you?
So good news. The officer spoke to the homeowners.
They're not gonna press charges.
Good. l won't either.
Okay, then. So we're good to go.
You ready?
Marie, you wanna go home?
Marie?
Yes, it's Skyler White calling for Saul Goodman, please.
Yes, it is important.
Thank you.
Sorry. Same as before.
But this is not right.
You cannot shut me down. You cannot do this.
I've checked your wastewater inside and out.
I've checked your runoff gutters, and now out here, more contaminants.
Ammonia, acetone, benzene, nitrobenzene.
No, no, no, this is a mistake.
Where is Gary? He'll tell you my soap is very good, very green.
Your soap is not the issue, it's your filtration system.
The very least, you'll need to retrofit.
But if you're leeching into the groundwater,
which is a real possibility here,
you're gonna need to replace your system.
Replace?
Do you know what cost that is? Two hundred thousand dollars.
It's a hardship.
If you like, we can give you a list of approved vendors.
If you get going, your downtime shouldn't be any more than five weeks.
Okay. So sorry, you are right.
From now on, we will be extra careful and clean.
No more pollution, okay? Yes? No, I'm sorry.
The state requires you to suspend all activity
until these levels reach the mandated minimums.
Where is usual man? Where is Gary? Got transferred to Las Cruces.
If you'd like to file an appeal-- I have done nothing wrong.
Tell me why you shut me down.
What laws did l break? What laws? Several.
Tell me exact specific laws or I refuse. Right now.
Tell me what laws l broke. The specific laws
Hold on. Okay, hold on, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.
Okay. The New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act of 1 978,
section 74, chapter four, part 1 3 states:
"Whenever the disposal of solid or hazardous waste presents"...
-an imminent or substantial endangerment,
the offender may be fined
not more than $5000 each day in which the violation occurs.
All right, okay.
Now the...
Okay, baby.
All right. The EPA can cite him under the Toxic Substances...
-Control Act of 1 976.
U.S. code, title 1 5, chapter 53--
"--subchapter 1 "...
-section 2606.
Satisfied?
Was that specific...
-specific enough for you?
Threw one in the channel in the 1 0th.
I guess they're even now.
Yep.
And they're even in this match. Both have...
All done with lunch?
Hm.
You hardly touched this.
I'm not hungry.
Well...
I'm leaving the rice pudding.
I'm not hungry, Marie.
So don't eat it.
Speaking of babies, he has a new one, Joseph, and a son, Anthony.
Hey, Marie. How you doing?
I'm okay. Is there a problem? No, no.
Everything's fine.
I'm here for Hank, actually.
Oh, you're so sweet. Hank'll be thrilled.
Hard and straight.
And makes it the wrong way.
Sweetie.
You have a visitor.
Oh, Jesus.
What now? She rob a bank?
Hey, buddy. How you doing?
Oh, well...
Can't complain. You know, every day a little better.
That's good. You're looking good. Yeah, well,
handsome was never the hard part.
Come on in, grab a seat.
Yeah, just throw that stuff anywhere.
Listen, uh...
thanks again for the other day. You know, this whole thing, it's, uh...
It's been hard on her.
Forget it. Glad to help.
So rock collecting?
They're minerals, but, yeah.
It's cataloging. You know, sort them, label them.
It's actually a lot of work. Yeah.
No, it looks like it.
So, what's up? Well...
Actually, I could use your help on something.
Homicide. Possibly drug-related.
You want my help on a case? What am I, Ironside? Heh-heh-heh.
No, you're a drug cop who knows the local talent.
And a pal I just did a favor for, so let me pick your brain a sec.
You ever come across a guy by the name of Gale Boetticher?
No.
Someone came along and shot him in the face.
Okay. No signs of forced entry,
no signs of robbery.
Okay, so it's a crime of passion. Where's the drug angle?
We found a notebook at his place.
I made a copy for you, in case you're interested.
Looks like it pertains to some kind of methamphetamine superlab.
Yeah.
It's filled with scientific formulas and chemical purchase lists,
drawings, pages and pages of this stuff.
It looks big-time, but I'm no authority, so I wonder if you might take a look?
Come on, Tim, seriously?
What is this, some sort of a charity thing?
Your expertise could be useful here.
I'm lying here like third base,
living from bowel movement to bowel movement.
I'm not even useful to myself.
Want my advice?
You take this to Steve Gomez.
He'll help you out. I give this to Steve Gomez
and all of a sudden it becomes a DEA case, what good does that do me?
If you could just take a look, tell me what I got here.
I'd really appreciate it.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Thanks, man.
Take it easy.
That's what I do. Heh, heh.
No, no.
The three, seven, nine. He says, "No."
Well, it was a good try.
Here we go. Time for your nap. Yeah.
Okay.
So...
Nail salon sounded promising. What do you think?
I think we wait.
Wait?
Skyler, it has been five hours.
He'll call.
Just wait. Just wait.
Look...
It was a good idea. It was a great idea, but it didn't work.
So why don't we simply chalk it up as a learning--
White residence.
Oh, hello, Mr. Wolynetz.
Am l still interested?
Well, I think that depends.
Yes, 879 was the original offer, but that seems high to me now.
Now l'm offering 800. No, no, no.
No, don't do that. Why?
Well, because you're an unpleasant person, Mr. Wolynetz.
You were rude, disrespectful towards my husband.
Furthermore, l've met with quite a number of sellers
and the market seems much softer than I thought, so 800.
Uh-huh. Hm.
Well, I understand that you're disappointed, but that is my final offer.
I'm sorry we couldn't make it work. Goodbye.
What are you doing?
I'm negotiating.
Why?
Because l want to pay less.
Oh, no.
Seventy-nine thousand dollars less?
Who cares? Do you know how much I make?
Yeah, but that's the very reason we need to negotiate.
We don't wanna arouse suspicion by not trying to get a good deal.
Look, I get the logic, l do, but you just went too far with it.
You're calling him names?
I didn't call him names. I said he was unpleasant.
Well, he's not calling you back.
I mean, you didn't honestly think that worked?
Yeah, I do.
No way. Sorry. No.
So look, it's time to move on.
Okay? l'm gonna call Saul.
Where's my phone?
No. What?
No, just-- What for?
Wait. Wait.
Oh, my God.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Wolynetz.
No one's paying attention to where these things are.
There's gotta be thousands of them all over the world coming right for us.
And put one inside an ice cream truck, drive it into San Francisco.
I'm not even that scared of burning up and cannibalism.
To me, the thing that worries me is getting trampled
or shoved up against a chain-link fence.
If you think about it, if you're against a chain-link fence
and you've got a lot, I mean, a lot of people trying to escape,
pushing hard enough forward, Unh.
you are gonna get squeezed right through the chain links.
Like Play-Doh or some kind of soft meat.
And this is inevitable, okay?
And there's nothing you or me or anyone can do about it.
And if the fence posts are stuck deep, really deep with the cement,
way down inside the ground,
it's definitely happening to you.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, bitch.
Somebody got shot. Somebody probably got shot.
Like soft meat, man.
Right through. Squeezed through there like soft meat.
Like soft meat.
Right through the chain links, right through the chain links.
Hey. Hey.
Money!
That one was mine.
Take it easy!
Hey, you took mine, man!
Yeah!
Ooh.
Whoa.
Aww...
Nice. Yeah.
To clean cars and clean money.
Hear, hear.
You see?
I told you we'd get it.
Did you? Mm-hm.
Wow. Ha, ha.
Seriously.
It was really great work.
It's impressive.
Thank you.
And Saul finally came through. Ahem.
Well, I mean, he found the guy, right?
Well, yes, he found the guy, but l told him what to do and what to say.
You're right. That's the hard part.
But, yes, Saul was finally useful. Ha, ha.
Throw him a bone.
Mm. Oh, my God.
This is truly amazing. Yes, well, it better be.
Three hundred twenty dollars a bottle.
What?
"CuvÃ©e Pol Roger Sir Winston Churchill."
Apparently, it was his favorite champagne,
so they just named it after him.
How did you pay for it? What do you mean?
Ah. No. Cash, I paid cash.
No, I'm asking how did you, Walter White,
an unemployed schoolteacher, pay for it?
How do you explain it? Skyler.
No one saw me.
Whoever sold it to you did.
And that's not the point. The point is we're broke, remember?
I'm waiting for your unemployment check so I can pay the phone bill.
I asked for an extension from the power company. Why?
Because on paper, we have no money. You are completely overreacting.
I'm not apologizing for wanting to celebrate in some small way.
I'm not asking you to apologize, Walt.
I'm asking you to be smart.
I bought one bottle of champagne.
One single bottle, Skyler.
I paid cash. That's it.
That's all it takes, okay? I mean, look at Watergate.
One piece of duct tape on a door
brought down the president of the United States.
What? l'm Nixon now? No.
What l'm saying is the devil is in the details.
One little mistake, one slipup in our story,
that could ruin us.
Fine.
Gotta destroy the evidence.
And when l look at this image that is part of the record,
I am very concerned about what sort of distraction that could be,
whether it's from any sort of signage,
but especially signage that's changing every five seconds.
Thank you.
Any other questions?
We have a motion and a second on the floor to grant the appeal.
All those in favor, raise your hand and say yes. Yes.
There's four in the affirmative. Those opposed?
There's five no's and the-- That motion fails.
I would like to make a motion to uphold the decision
and the findings of the EBC.
And the motion, then, is seconded by Councilor Cook. Any questions?
I see none. All those in favor, signify by saying "yes" to deny the appeal.
All those in favor, signify by saying "yes."
There's five in the affirmative. All those opposed, say "no."
There's four in the negative. Now, that passes.
ï»¿11
You want me to open the doors?
Here. The keys. Take them.
Why you talking?
No! No, no, no--
Gambling destroyed my life.
Me, my family, everything l loved.
It was like a robbery, only l was the thief.
It's amazing the stories you tell yourself to justify it.
The lies that lead you to just one more hand, one more spin,
one more roll of the dice.
This is our deal, okay? Marie, no.
You guys are not lifting a finger. I mean it.
Yeah, we're bringing everything. So-- This is not up for debate, okay?
Great.
Sweetie, don't worry. We're not gonna say one word about the bills.
We just wanna bring everyone up to speed.
All right, I'll see you soon. Bye.
So...
tonight's the night. No turning back.
Well...
Okay. Let's do this.
Okay. So first, I assign point values.
Correlate to the effect of removal.
You're gonna split the eights? Skyler, please.
Now, the mathematical principle known as the Kelly Criterion,
upon which I devised my own strategy--
Not dissimilar to the MlT system--
Walt, you're not teaching them.
You wanted me to be thorough. Play. You're taking too long.
You don't think it behooves me to be able to explain any of this?
It behooves you to be a pro, that's all. That's the fiction. So chop-chop.
Don't "chop-chop" me. Walt.
Now, we both know that the first decision
is whether or not to split or to surrender.
On eights. Split them.
Good on both.
Next decision is whether to double down or not.
Which you should be doing. On an 1 1 , yes. Double.
Okay, this hand over here, we have a soft 1 8.
The final decision is whether or not to hit or to stand. Hit it.
Becomes a hard 1 5. Dealer has a nine.
I see that. Hm.
Hit it. Oh.
Okay, let's see what I got.
And 21 .
Damn. Yup.
Okay, the key thing to remember here is that it's not about any one hand.
The key is the number of hands per hour.
Mm. Let's go again.
Zero, minus one, 0.6.
Okay.
Walt. It's not as if I don't know how to play.
I certainly more than understand how to count cards.
Let's just keep going.
No, you know what? I'm in recovery, remember?
I shouldn't even be playing.
And that is the fiction that we should be sticking to.
You know what?
You're right. Yeah. Wow.
Okay. Um-- We're not leaving anything to chance.
All right. Let's get started. Got a lot of, uh--
Walt. We got a lot of ground to cover. What is this?
We have to get our story straight. We've gotta be on the same page.
A script? Bullet points.
Bullet points? We got a novella.
This is smart. You really wanna try to sell a DEA agent
some full-of-holes story about how we suddenly
have enough money to buy a car wash?
Am l supposed to memorize this? We need to practice.
We need to be word-perfect. Within reason.
We need this story to be solid
and sympathetic and, most of all, completely believable.
The story that you already told Marie.
You think that she hasn't told Hank? Ha.
Come on, this is Marie we're talking about here.
No, she hasn't. Heh.
She hasn't.
Hank thinks his insurance is paying for everything.
Marie's not telling him we are paying his therapy bills.
And neither are we. And why is that again?
Really? If we have the gambling story...
Did you take money, Walt? You remember Gretchen and Elliot?
I seem to recall that you'd rather sell drugs than take help.
Fine. Marie will tell Hank in her own time.
And at least we'll have laid the groundwork.
And coming clean with Hank and Juni--
Appearing to come clean will be the best thing for everyone.
We talked about this.
Okay? We agreed about this. Yes, we did. lt's just...
What?
Never mind. Just--
Okay. So I really think we should tag team the narrative, okay?
We'll each be responsible for certain portions of the story and then we can, uh--
We can hand off so we don't leave anything out, and it'll seem natural.
Okay. So I'm gonna launch with the exciting news
that we are buying a car wash.
Yay.
The next logical question Hank will probably ask is:
"Where are you getting the money?" To which I'll say:
We wanna tell you the whole story. It's a doozy,
so hold onto your hats.
Do you like that?
Sure.
It accomplishes two things. It keeps it light while letting them know
to expect something big. Uh-huh.
Yeah. No. lt's a doozy.
Okay. Anyway, that's where you will take over, starting with your diagnosis.
Pages one and two. Okay. And it's--
It's pretty much gonna run parallel to the truth, which makes it easier.
But just make sure to really hit the cancer.
Really touch on the fear and despair.
It's good to remind them and to get their sympathy.
We want them to understand why you could do something so stupid.
Now, after that, per pages three and four, after you say:
"Gambling became an addiction and I just couldn't control it."
Do you see that? Yes.
In the middle. Okay.
I put in that line about robbery, from the GA meeting. That was good.
So next, I'll chime in about how it affected our marriage,
starting with the confusion, the deceit, why we couldn't tell anyone--
I'm terribly, terribly ashamed of my actions.
Yeah. Two "terribly"s?
It's to show contrition. Well, I just wouldn't use that word.
I would never say the word "terribly."
Phrase it however you want. Okay? You're jumping ahead. Now--
And why--? And why am I so ashamed?
Do I really need to answer that?
I was, and am, providing for our family.
Let's just pick up where we left off. I'm weak, I'm out of control.
This makes me look like crap.
This has to be a warts-and-all story.
That's how we'll sell it. We both look bad.
Oh-- How do you look bad exactly?
Where is the "I slept with my boss" bullet point?
I can't seem to find that anywhere.
For a fired schoolteacher who cooks crystal meth,
I'd say you're coming out pretty much ahead.
I don't like it. I don't want Junior thinking less of me.
At least you won at gambling. I'm the bitch mom who wouldn't cut you slack.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I put you through all of this.
How's that sound? Hm?
Here.
Two "sorry"s.
I believe we were on page five.
So after you say how very sorry you are, in your own words, of course,
we're almost to the end.
And then I say how proud I am of you for joining a 12-step program.
And this is where I think we should enact how we're feeling, you know?
Just a suggestion. You might look down at the floor with remorse.
Hm?
What? You don't have to mean it.
You just stare down at your feet, Walt, okay?
Then I'm gonna--
I was thinking of taking Marie's hand and saying something emotional like:
It's such a relief to tell you.
We're glad we have a strong family to help us.
That we can all support each other. And then maybe I'll tear up a little.
I don't know. We'll just have to see what happens in the moment.
You're gonna cry on cue?
I said, I don't know. Maybe. When you dab your eyes,
you gonna do it with your right hand or your left?
One tear? Two tears? How many? This has to be convincing.
Especially to Hank. I'm doing the best I can here, Walt.
And yes, l'm thorough.
Maybe lying doesn't come as easily to me as it does to you.
Guys! Come on in! Hi!
Hey.
Good to see you! Hey.
Hey, you little punk! Hey.
Hey.
Great to see you. How you doing?
Aw, look at my little princess. She's getting big, huh?
Yeah. And heavy too.
Oh, is that actual food I'm smelling?
I might get an honest-to-God meal here?
You look good. Thank you, sweetheart.
Your Aunt Marie, she's cute, but she could burn water. Ha, ha, ha.
You are so hilarious. Show the boys your rock collection.
We're gonna get organized. It'll be 20 minutes.
You have a rock collection? It's a mineral collection.
Just something I've-- You wanna see it?
Sure. All right. Let's go see it.
Ooh, hey, let me-- Hey, no. l-- l got it.
Come on, guys. It's down the hall here.
Now, that one there, that's rhodonite.
Okay? lt's manganese inosilicate.
Cool. What makes it be all pink like that?
Well, that's the manganese part. Okay? lt oxidizes, you know, like rust.
Manganese can have an oxidation state
of between minus-three and plus-seven,
which takes it through a range of colors. Purple, green, blue.
But its most stable state is plus-two, which is usually pale pink.
So...
Exactly. Whatever the hell he said. Heh, heh. Anyway, you, uh, get the idea.
Yeah, it's interesting.
Interesting stuff, that. Really.
Oh, hey. Uh...
Yeah, give me that.
Give me that file, will you? You gotta check this out.
I've been working on something here. I'm doing a little consulting.
You know, weighing in on a case for A.P.D.
Put that in for me. Put that in over there.
Hank, what is this? It's not a dead body--
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing like that. No.
Seriously, you guys you gotta check this out.
This is good. Ready? Let me get it going here.
Look at this guy.
âª Standing there alone âª
Look at-- Heh.
âª All systems are go âª
âª Are you sure? Control is not convinced âª
âª But the computer Has the evidence âª
âª No need to abort âª
âª The countdown starts âª
Oh, man. You can't make this stuff up.
Who is this?
That, my friends, is Albuquerque's public enemy number one.
âª Calling, calling home âªâª
It's such a relief to finally tell you.
We're just so glad that we have a strong family to help us through this.
That we can all support each other.
Jesus. l don't even know where to-- Holy shit.
Yeah.
Walter H. White.
Man of hidden talents.
Dad, you're such a stud. How much did you win exactly?
Dad? I don't think I have exact figures.
It's enough to-- After taxes, of course, to buy the car wash.
Maybe even pay for
a couple of halfway reasonable college educations.
Damn, Dad, why'd you quit?
I can totally get a car for my birthday now, right?
Son, l'm terribly, terribly ashamed of my actions.
Would you excuse me, please? I need to use the restroom.
Wow. Heh, heh.
Walt?
Hey. Whoa, whoa.
Oh. Sorry.
Thought you might have fallen in. No, no, l just, uh...
Hey, man, that was some big stuff back there.
No, we wanted to be thorough, so...
Yeah, well, it was quite a tale. Couldn't have been easy to, you know,
talk about.
You know, Walt, if you--
You can always bend my ear, right? I mean, if you ever need to talk,
or just blow off some steam, I'm here.
Not going anywhere, so...
Thanks, Hank.
Same goes for me, you know. If you ever wanna bounce anything off me,
I don't know, casework, anything, really.
Sometimes just talking something through,
you know, really can make a difference.
We're definitely not talking bathtub crank here. This is a big-ass operation.
You know, hundreds of pounds a week. Maybe more.
So, um, who is this person? What do you know about him?
Other than he's deader than a Texas salad bar
and has a decent set of pipes?
I'd say he's my guy. Your guy?
There's this mystery man I've been chasing for the better part of a year.
Cooks the purest meth that me or anyone else has ever seen.
Goes by the name of Heisenberg.
Hm. Yeah. Pretty weird, huh?
I looked him up. It was one of these physic-- One of Hitler's guys.
You know, a physicist named Werner Heisenberg. Heh, heh. Real cute, huh?
I figure with a handle like that, my guy's gotta be some sort of--
Some sort of an egghead. No offense.
And here we go. Gale "Major Tom" Boetticher.
Anyway, I just wanna see if l'm, you know,
not barking up the wrong tree, chemically speaking.
As far as I can make out, he's writing about a phenylacetone cook, right?
Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty rare these days,
but it does jibe with the blue stuff I've been tracking.
"Two sticks dairy-free soy margarine, two-third cup turbinado sugar."
It's a recipe for vegan s'mores. Heh. There's all kinds of crazy crap in there.
Yeah, like, you know, top-ten recumbent bicycles,
indoor composting tips.
All right next to the mother of methamphetamine syntheses.
This guy was a, uh... Man, he was a real character.
Yeah, he seems unique.
Yeah. Let me show you something. Give it here.
Right here at the, uh... Right here at the top it says:
"To W.W. My star, my perfect silence." Heh.
W.W. Heh, heh, heh.
I mean, who do you figure that is, huh?
Woodrow Wilson?
Willy Wonka?
Walter White?
You got me.
W.W. Hm.
Wait a minute. Let me see this...
for a second, because l think I remembered...
Ah. Here.
Yes.
Yeah.
"When l Heard the Learn'd Astronomer."
Learned.
And from time to time Look'd up in perfect silence At the stars
It's a poem by Walt Whitman.
Your W.W.
You freaking brainiac.
Ha. You freaking brainiac.
I must have skipped that day in school or something. Heh, heh.
I been chasing my tail about that one. Bet you're right.
Well, I'm glad I could be of help. Yeah.
Walt Whitman. Huh.
So you think this Gale person is your Heisenberg?
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.
God, I wanted to get this guy.
It looks like you did.
No, I mean, you know, me personally, you know?
I wanted to be the one to slap the handcuffs on him, that kind of shit.
Popeye Doyle waving to Frog One.
If I recall, at least from the first French Connection,
Popeye Doyle never actually caught him.
Yeah, I guess me and old Popeye, huh?
Day late and a dollar short.
What about the person who killed him?
A.P.D.'s problem, not mine.
Any leads? My buddy Tim says
they got some fingerprints they're trying to ID.
Eyewitness saw a person of interest. Might get lucky there.
Somebody knows something. They'll track the shooter eventually.
Jesse!

Now.
Go ahead.
Would you stop doing what you're doing, please?
I'm not done, yo. And that dude's next.
What the hell? What is wrong--? We have business to discuss.
So discuss. Jesus.
Let go of me.
Gale's murder is being investigated.
Uh, duh.
And I have it on good authority that they found fingerprints at the scene.
Not mine.
We done here? No, we are not done here.
What if they are yours? How can you be so sure?
Because l'm here. Your brother-in-law's got such a hard-on for me,
if the cops found my fingerprints-- Shh.
If the cops found my prints within five blocks of that place,
they would've picked me up by now.
What about the casing?
Oh, my God. Or casings?
How many times did you shoot him, anyway?
Jesse, did you pick up the casings?
Did you pick them up?
No.
Yeah, well...
Listen, we gotta go over this step-by-step, everything.
Tell me exactly what happened from the moment you got there.
I got in, l got out. No.
No, I need to know specifics. Now, we'll start from the beginning.
You drove there. You drove over there. You went to his door, right?
Jesse, l need you to concentrate.
This is very important. Did you knock or ring?
Knock or ring? Unh!
Knock.
Good, good. That's very good. Now, listen.
Assume that Gale answered the door. What happened after that?
Did he recognize you?
Did you say anything to each other?
Did you walk into the room or did you shoot him right then and there?
What?
Who wants to make a hundred bucks?
Yeah.
Huh?
Look, the kid's probably right.
If they had anything on him, he'd be locked up already.
What about my brother-in-law? He suspects Jess--
Hell, he knows Jesse is involved in the sale of blue meth.
That was Hank's one-and-only lead. What if he puts two and two together
and he goes after Jesse for the murder?
Goes after him how, on his Rascal scooter? Ha, ha.
Ahem. That perhaps sounded insensitive. Uh...
But if he goes after him, I'll sue his ass for police brutality,
harassment, assault and 1 6 other things.
No, history those two have together, being what it is,
gotta figure your brother-in-law's smart enough not to go down that road.
Goose egg. Bubkes. That's what the cops got.
I wouldn't worry about it. Ugh.
Yeah, what else should I not worry about, Saul? Hm?
Should I not worry that Gus plans to murder me at the first chance he gets?
That my drug-addicted partner doesn't seem to care whether he lives or dies?
You should see his house. It's like skid row.
He has actual hobos living there.
Now, how long before Gus decides that he's too big of a risk?
Jeez, l got Mike, that grunting, dead-eyed cretin
sucker-punching me in the face. I've got Gus wielding a box cutter.
I mean, Western Union, message received.
Let me ask you. When did this stop being a business? Hm?
Why am l the only person capable of behaving in a professional manner?
No, any way you slice it, everyone is in danger.
I mean, how can l protect anyone?
My family, Jesse, myself?
My name never comes up with those guys, does it?
And meanwhile, we're buying this stupid car wash.
Oh, yeah. That ship has sailed, bon voyage.
We are committed.
We already told our family about it.
And now Skyler, I'm sure she believes--
She needs to believe that everything is neat and tidy.
And she's telling herself that I work in this nice, quiet little lab
with a white lab coat and a pocket protector
and when my contract is up, I'll just simply hang it all up,
tip my hat and walk away.
Oh, God.
How did everything get so screwed up?
Yeah, you do have a little shit-creek action happening.
You know, FYl, you can buy a paddle.
This is a last-resort, back-pocket kind of thing,
but if you really gotta protect yourself, uh,
disappear...
Poof.
There's a guy who can make it happen.
They call him a, uh, "dissapearer."
For a substantial fee, and I do mean substantial,
you and your loved ones can vanish. Untraceable.
I mean, he sets you up with a whole new life.
What, like a witness protection kind of thing?
Beyond. I mean, off the grid.
New identities, new everything. No one would ever be able to trace you.
Now, be clear. This is an end game, if you get my meaning.
I mean, there's no coming back.
So you want his card?
God, there's gotta be something else that I can do.
Some way to keep everything from spiraling out of control.
Well, from what you told me,
it sounds like Pinkman is first up in the imminent-demise department.
Gus won't risk letting the police find Jesse.
I know him. He won't.
l'm not kidding. If you really think about it, you can't even see it.
How can you know how bad radio frequencies, microwaves,
and cell phones are getting you?
You could be strolling through security at the airport--
Hey, wake up, bitches.
You get waved through a x-ray scanner.
Next day, you could be dead or dying from all the radiation they say is safe.
But there's no way it could be. It has to deliver a concentrated dose.
Enough to penetrate clothes.
The accumulated amount could be dangerous to susceptible individuals,
especially from a rural area. Hey, yo.
The ozone layer is already thin because of the cow farts.
Yo!
Oh, hey.
Make sure there's pizza here when l get back.
All right? Enough for everybody. Oh. Oh, yeah.
I can do that. I can definitely do that.
Not a problem. I can get the stuff, the pizza and stuff.
But as far as the financial situation, you know...
Just hang on. Hang on. Yeah, yeah.
And you know, the concentrated doses,
it's gonna fuck with your bone marrow and it's gonna mess up...
Because-- Because especially if you have cancer.
You know, because if you gotta get a bone-marrow transplant,
your odds are 60 percent. You got a 60 percent chan--
Hey.
Oh.
Hey, hey.
Huh?
Get some dipping sticks too, yo.
Yeah, I can definitely get dipping sticks.
All right. I can get them.

Downstairs. Now.
Where is everybody?
I invited your guests to leave.
Know who this is?
Nope. You ought to.
He's been at your house for three solid days.
Okay.
He stole your money.
Okay.
That $78,000 or so look familiar?
This is it? That's it.
Okay. Thanks.
Wanna know what's next for Little Miss Pissed-in-His-Pants?
No. You sure, now?
Yep.
Don't even wanna take a wild guess?
You're gonna kill him.
Is this the part where I'm supposed to beg you not to do it?
Oh, please, please.
And then what?
I'm supposed to promise, cross my heart,
to straighten up and fly right or toe the line,
or some other crap that I'm not gonna say?
Is that what your little show here was all about?
You're on thin ice, you little shithead. You know that?
You ain't gonna smoke that dude in there.
You know how come I know?
Because you went through the trouble of putting a blindfold on him.
I'm going back to bed.
Let yourselves out.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
How's the ear? Mending.
What can l do for you?
It's Pinkman.
He's become increasingly incautious.
He's a risk. A liability.
I know he and Walter come as a team and that Walter won't like it,
but something's gotta be done.
You gotta be kidding.
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.
Right. This is message number three.
You'd better be ready in two minutes, because l am right outside your door.
Jesse!
Damn it.
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.
Oh, great.
Jesse!
Oh. This is perfect.
You are a piece of work, you know that?
Jesse?
Jesse.
Jesse?
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.
Where is he?
Gonna ask where we're going?
Nope.
ï»¿3
Say you understand.
You understand?
Tell me you understand, Saul!
Every dollar. lf you don't hear from me in 24 hours--
No, look. Shut-- Saul. Saul, shut up. Shut up and listen to me.
I want you to give her every dollar. I don't care if you stuff it in trash bags.
Just make sure she gets everything. All right? Just make it happen.
Hi. You've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.
Uh... Hey.
It's me. Um...
I...
I just wanted to say that I was thinking about you and the kids, and, uh...
I love you.
Hello, would you like
to try our breakfast chicken chalupa combo meal?
Gus Fring.
Excuse me?
Gustavo Fring, your boss, now. Please.
Mr. Fring isn't here right now. Is--? He's here.
His car is parked out front. He's here.
He was here. Mr. Fring was--
You just go in the back and you tell him it's Walter White. Understand?
He'll know what it's about.
I'll wait.
Yeah, let me get a chalupa special.
Hello?
Walter, what exactly are you doing?
Where is Jesse?
Jesse's with me. He's fine.
What, do you expect me to just believe that?
I'm crossing my heart, Walter.
Where is he? Hold on.
Yo.
Jesse?
Yeah. What's up?
Jesse, where are you? With Mike.
I know you're with Mike.
Are you all right? Does he have a gun on you?
No.
What's going on, then?
We're driving. Driving.
Driving where?
I don't know. Um...
North.
Why is he driving you? Where is he going?
Beats me.
I don't-- Put Mike back on.
Hello again.
Mike, tell me now exactly what is going on.
Jesse's with me today.
So, what you need to do is go back to your lab and get on with the cook.
You're gonna have to muddle through this without him.
That's what's going on. But it doesn't--
Goodbye, Walter. Mike--
Sir.
Excuse me. Hey. You're not allowed back there.
Excuse me, sir.
As l said, sir, Mr. Fring is not here. This area is for employees only.
I have to ask that you leave immediately.
What you told Mr. White, that's...
It's just bullshit, right?
What, you figure on just leaving me in some ditch?
What do you care?
I don't.
But l'll tell you now, you better shoot straight, old man,
or I'll slice off your other ear before this is over.
You coming?
We gotta do this six more times today with a lot of miles in between.
I'd like to finish before dark.
This freaking guy, I tell you what.
It's like Scarface had sex with Mr. Rogers or something. Heh, heh.
Who does this, you know?
Your boy Heisenberg, thought we had him already.
Yeah. Keep dreaming.
Yeah, no. Getz busted him a few months back.
Yeah, well, no offense to Detective Doogie Howser there,
but all he caught was a dipshit lifer by the name of Jimmy In-'N-Out.
This one, he's your Heisenberg?
Yeah, I believe he is.
So, what are you thinking? Rival drug gang taking out the mastermind?
Any names I should check out?
I wish I could help you there.
Only two people l know connected with the blue stuff.
One is a beanie-wearing jizz-stain
by the name of Brandon Mayhew, street name "Badger."
Definitely not a player. Heh.
And the other one is, uh,
Jesse Pinkman.
He and l have a history.
Yeah.
You see Pinkman as a shooter?
That would surprise me.
Well, we have a composite of a person of interest.
It's a guy the neighbors saw at Boetticher's place
right after the shooting.
Yeah. Sorry. No, hang on to it, just in case.
We got a couple of prints we're hoping to ID.
If I get any kind of hit, I'll keep you in the loop on that.
You know, um,
Tim, look, I appreciate what you're doing, really,
you know, keeping me involved and all,
but, you know, finding this guy Heisenberg dead like this...
I have to say, it, uh...
kind of feels like closure to me.
Hank, you really are a big help here.
No, I know. I get it, really.
But l'm done.
You don't need to do that.
This is why I'm out here, right?
To be, like, your backup?
Uh-huh.
So if l'm out here in a guard-type capacity
to watch over the money, that means l need, like, a gun, right?
Nope.
I mean, isn't that, like, idiotic for me to be out here without a gun?
You haven't said dick about what I'm doing here.
Now l'm supposed to do it without a gun?
How does that even make sense?
What? l can smoke, right?
Not a chance.
âª Fallacies âª
âª None for you and two for me âªâª
It's finally hitting me what the plan is here.
It's to bore me to death,
so mission accomplished because it's totally working.
Great job.
You know, I really do get what's going on
with all the dead drops
and bags of cash.
Me and my boys had the exact same system when I was running things.
My crew.
Nowhere near the same cheese you guys are slinging, but same theory.
You know, maintain separation between dealer and supplier,
reduce risk,
et cetera.
Look, don't you think it'd be good if there was some communication here?
You got me riding shotgun to every dark anal recess in the state.
Be nice if you clued me in a little.
I mean, I'm here to do a job, right?
And, l mean, yo, like, if I'm the guy,
then you should just tell me what the hell is up.
What? You are not the guy.
You're not capable of being the guy. I had a guy, but now I don't.
You are not the guy.
Then what the hell am I doing here? I don't know.
It's not my call. I just do what I'm told.
And now you're gonna do what you're told, which is to sit here,
shut up, and stay in the car till we finish our pickups. You got it?
Oh!
We having second thoughts? Every hour of every day.
Heh. Let me tell you, that is perfectly normal.
But your expectations are realistic.
You have a good, solid business plan. I'm feeling very confident.
You have an excellent shot at making this work.
Walt?
Hm? Are you good?
Yeah.
All right.
Well, my congratulations to the both of you.
Thank you very much, Alan.
It is my pleasure.
Ah.
Mr. White.
Best of luck. Thank you.
I'm bringing the car over first thing next week for a wash and wax.
We'll be looking for you. l'll be there.
Thank you again.
You're welcome.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Wow. lt's official.
How are you feeling?
I'm...
Well, I'm-- How do you feel?
Um...
Nervous.
Scared.
This is a big step, Walt.
If we don't do this right--
We'll be fine.
We will?
Tell me again.
We will be fine. Believe it.
If we're gonna do this, I mean, really gonna do this,
then we have to promise each other
no more secrets.
There can't be any mistakes like before.
There has to be complete honesty.
I'm all for that.
Good.
Well, then, um,
how about a drink to celebrate?
Well-- Well, we own a big-ass car wash now.
We do. I guess that merits a celebration.
Nothing too expensive.
Right. Right. Non-fancy liquor it is. Yes.
Just as long as it gets the job done. Ooh.
Uh, it's me.
I just wanted to say that I was thinking about you and the kids, and...
I love you.
Okay. Okay.
Just take it off. Just take it off. Okay. Okay. Okay.
The sheets, they smell different than l remember.
Hm? Don't they?
Oh.
New fabric softener. Mm.
Yeah, I like it.
I, uh, also got a new haircut. Don't know if you--
Oh, yes, l was gonna say something.
Were you, really?
I do like it.
Thanks.
So, um.
dinner tomorrow night?
I told Marie that we'd come over and eat with them.
Uh--
Think maybe you'll be free?
Yeah.
Yeah, we can do that. That'll be nice.
Good.
Marie says it's about the only thing that'll get Hank out of his room.
Mom?
Ooh.
Hey, Mom? Dad?
Hey, son.
Where are you?
Uh, we're back here.
We'll be out in a minute.
Oh, God.
Seriously?
I'm parked in the driveway.
This is going to make for some very interesting dinner conversation.
He is definitely gonna ask about our living situation now.
Maybe, um...
Maybe you should move back in.
You know, just so it's easier to explain to everyone.
You think?
I have to get back to work.
You know, schedule.
Yeah.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Damn it.
Hey!
Hey! This is a two-man job. I can't do it alone.
I'm done. That's it.
Finished. Nothing else happens until l get my partner back.
Jesse?
Where is Jesse?
I need him. You people have me down here
trying to complete a two-man operation by myself.
It's unacceptable. It's dangerous and counterproductive.
Jesse operates the forklift, not me.
That's one of the many, many things he does around the lab
that keeps us on schedule, so I suggest
that you get him back down here as soon as you--
Are you listening to me?
Hello?
Where do you want it?
This is it, right? Last stop?
Last stop?
Hey, I've been counting, yo. No more pickups after--
âª Fallacies âª
âª Fallacies âªâª
âª Fallacies âª
âª One for you and two for me âª
âª Fallacies âªâª
Yeah. I'm gonna need to be picked up. Now.
Garcia's on Central. Honk once. I'll meet you in the parking lot.
Cancel that.
Hey, this dude--
This dude was coming right at me with a shotgun.
They blocked the alley and they were gonna rip us off. I didn't have a choice.
I had to put it in reverse, slam into the guy's car, and just--
I saw.
You saw.
Ah, Jesus.
I just--
I don't know.
Go ahead, kid.
Smoke up.
Hmm.
Morning.
Hey. Good morning, son.
You want me to pour you some juice?
I'll take a coffee.
Didn't know you started drinking coffee.
Yeah. I also started tying my own shoelaces too, all by myself.
Go grab a mug.
Milk? Sugar?
Just black.
Black. I like it.
Uh, hey, Dad, l just gotta say...
I just wanted to say it's really cool to have you here.
Thank you, son.
It's cool to be back home.
It just feels...
Mom said you're moving back in this Tuesday.
She...?
She said that?
Yeah.
Tuesday, is it? Huh.
How about that?
Jesse. Jesse.
Yo, what's up?
What are you doing?
Uh, breaking ice.
I mean, what are you doing here?
Where's your car? Mike dropped me off.
Jesse.
Jesse!
What happened yesterday? Where were you?
I was out with Mike, helped him make pickups.
Picking up what? Cash. Dead drops.
Mike made the pickups and I guarded him.
You guarded Mike?
What is this, a joke?
Hey, know what? Two dudes tried to rob us and l saved the stash.
I took care of business, just like l'm taking care of business right now.
You wanna stand there dicking around, or you wanna suit up and get to work?
Get in gear, yo, because l'm meeting up with Mike this afternoon.
What, again? Why?
Guess l have two jobs now.
Los Pollos Hermanos, can l take your order?
Any injuries?
Twisted ankle, nothing too bad.
It all went like you thought it would, more or less.
I will, of course, reimburse you for the damage to your vehicles.
Questions? Uh-huh.
More than a few, yeah.
But l know better than to ask.
Anyway,
just like you wanted.
The kid's a hero.
Just the idea of owning a car wash seems so daunting, but I have to...
Who is just the most beautiful little girl in the world? You.
So coming into a business that's up and running,
fully operational, puts us way ahead of the game.
We're gonna still have some changeover time.
We'll have to hire some people. But we do have a staff in place,
so, you know, we'll be able to hold on to most of Bogdan's employees.
We might lose a few to the UltraWash across town, though.
They're making a grab, I hear.
Ah. Gonna put the kid to work? I've got school.
Not you. l'm talking about your baby sister. l wouldn't let you near my car.
Ha, ha.
Hey, that's not a bad idea, you guys.
You should put Holly on the sign.
Like a mascot? Like the Gerber baby.
I would get my car washed there if l saw her face out front.
What about me?
The goal is to bring customers in, not scare them away, so...
Walt, there's another bottle in the kitchen. Just help yourself.
Good.
Um, maybe we could roll Uncle Hank through the car wash.
He could be the first customer.
The wipe-down crew would clean you up good.
I got your wipe-down right here.
Hank, can we get through one meal without you grabbing your crotch?
So, what are you gonna do with Holly? You can't take her to work
with all those chemicals and migrants hanging around.
Marie-- What? That can't be safe.
Fortunately, five minutes from the car wash
there is the top child-care center in the city.
The National Child Care Association gives it high ratings.
So that's a huge relief and, you know, we could walk there if we had to.
Sky, I gotta tell you, l'm just-- I'm really, really impressed.
You came together on this. I'm happy that it's working out for you.
It's been a little scary, but it needed to be done.
And we get possession of the keys tomorrow.
Oh, that's awesome.
I can't wait to see what kind of car I'm going to get for my birthday
now with all this money rolling in.
You've been spending too much time around your Uncle Hank.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
Right, Uncle Hank?
Squeaky and greasy.
That's you, my friend.
Hey, Nick the Greek, you gonna share that bottle or what?
Yeah. Sorry.
Who's Nick the Greek?
He's a famous big-time card player.
Hank, that's not funny.
What? lt's a compliment.
That's even worse, then.
You're giving positive reinforcement
to behavior that Walt is working very, very hard to change.
Right, Skyler? Yeah.
I don't see how it's bad. Dad's raking in the beaucoup bucks.
You know, I just think maybe we could change the subject?
Yeah. Sure. You know. Absolutely.
Hey, Uncle Hank, what about that case you were looking at
with that crazy singing guy?
Ah. l'm off that. I gave my assessment to A.P.D. I'm done.
The case of the crazy singing guy. Hmm.
Sounds like an Encyclopedia Brown story.
Crazy is the wrong word.
This guy, Gale Boetticher, he was eccentric.
A real character, you know? He's dead now.
Huh. Who was he?
He was a meth cook.
Uh, he was a meth chef. Heh.
I mean, we're talking five stars. Candles and white tablecloth.
Hey, I can't believe these words are gonna come out of my mouth,
but he was a genius, plain and simple.
I mean, boy, if he had applied that big brain of his to something good,
who knows, he could've helped humanity or something.
I mean, how many actual geniuses are there in the world, right?
If he'd kind of taken his life in a different direction, who knows?
Hank,
not to tell you your business, but l'm not sure l agree.
What do you mean? Well, I mean,
you showed me that notebook, and from what l saw--
And this is just my humble opinion.
From what l saw on those papers...
Genius?
Not so much.
I mean, there was no reasoning, no deductions in those pages.
So to my eye, all his brilliance
looks like nothing more than just simple rote copying.
Probably of someone else's work.
Believe me, l have been around enough students to know.
Oh, this genius of yours...
maybe he's still out there.
Hank.
Hey, babe.
Uh, Tim stopped by. He brought over some file boxes on that case.
Thought I'd take another peek. That's great.
Sorry about the mess.
No, no, no. Don't be.
You want me to make some coffee?
Yeah.
Yeah, that'd be good.
Hmm.
You find something?
Oh, just this guy l'm looking at.
You know, everything he buys and eats
is organic, fair trade, vegan.
Since when do vegans eat fried chicken?
ï»¿7
No, no, no!
Hey.
Uh, it's me.
I just wanted to say that I was thinking about you and the kids, and, uh...
I love you.
Uh, it's me.
I just wanted to say that I was thinking about you and the kids, and, uh...
Morning. Afternoon.
Oh, really? Jesus.
You shouldn't have let me sleep.
You needed it.
Skyler, I don't entirely remember what happened last night.
I mean, I might have said some things that--
Did you know this Gale Boetticher person?
Skyler, I can't even focus on-- Gale Boetticher.
Did you know him? Heh.
My God. What--?
What exactly did l say last night?
Just enough.
Did you work together?
Who killed him?
Was it the people you work for?
Definitely not.
Was it somebody who,
at some point, might wanna do the same to you?
I seriously doubt it. No.
Ugh. God.
Oh, God.
I think I know what happened last night, Walt.
Mm. I know exactly what happened last night. I drank too much wine.
You told Hank
that the man he was looking for might still be out there.
That it might not be this Boetticher after all.
And I was up all night, wondering why you would say that to him.
Mm. Because l was drunk, Skyler.
No, but then I was remembering
your black eye.
Your, uh, business disagreement that you don't wanna talk about.
Look, I don't want to talk about any of this. Ever.
The firewall, all right?
Church and state.
That's how we need to approach this thing.
And then I remembered the message you left me the other day,
when you said you loved me.
When I heard that, I thought that maybe you--
I don't know, that you were regretting what's happened between us.
And I get that.
After last night, l...
Walt, I think you're scared.
I think that message was some kind of goodbye.
No, Skyler.
I think last night was a cry for help. Oh, Jesus.
A cry for help?
I think some part of you wants Hank to catch you.
Wow. That is just...
That is it exactly. Yes.
You're like Dr. Joyce Brothers here.
God.
At least this would all be over.
Yeah, yeah, oh, there's a tremendous weight just lifted off of me.
Now l understand myself.
Thank you. Thank you.
Walt, I've said it before.
If you are in danger, we go to the police.
I don't wanna hear about the police. I do not say that lightly.
I know what it could do to this family.
But if it's the only real choice we have, if it's either that or you getting shot--
I don't wanna hear about the police.
You're not some hardened criminal, Walt. You are in over your head.
That's what we'll tell them, the truth.
That is not the truth. Of course it is.
A schoolteacher, cancer, desperate for money.
We're done here. Roped into working-- Unable to quit.
You told me that yourself, Walt.
Jesus, what was I thinking? Walt, please.
Let's both of us stop trying to justify this whole thing
and admit you're in danger.
Who are you talking to right now?
Who is it you think you see?
Do you know how much l make a year?
I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it.
You know what would happen if l decided to stop going in to work?
A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up.
Disappears. It ceases to exist without me. No.
You clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in.
I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger.
A guy opens his door and gets shot, and you think that of me? No.
I am the one who knocks.
Look, I was...
Skyler?
Here we are, hm? Just like you left it.
And where is your pretty wife?
She has other business to attend to.
Well, like l say to her, place sells as is. Understand?
Yes, l understand.
Good, good.
I don't want her coming back with more demands.
She gave me hard time when we settled on price.
We're all on the same page, Bogdan.
So here is everything you need.
I keep very good files. Thank you.
So you are the boss now, huh?
You think you're ready?
Yes, l think so.
Being boss is tough.
I know you think I was hard on you,
but you'll learn.
Being in charge is not easy.
It takes hard work.
You've seen me work hard, Bogdan. Yeah?
I don't know.
Not so much, maybe.
But maybe when you are the boss,
you will just keep your feet up and relax.
Mm.
The real important thing--
And not everyone knows this.
-is to be tough.
Boss has to be tough.
Has to say no to people.
Has to make cashiers wipe down cars,
even if they don't want to.
Can you be tough, Walter?
I am sure you can handle.
And if not, you can always call your wife, no?
Always sticky. Yeah.
No problem.
As is.
Who'd have thought that someday l would be handing these keys to you?
Many years. Almost forgot.
Bogdan.
As is.
âª Exactly everything âª
Thank you.
Mm-hm.
âª But l can't believe âª
âª She gives it all to me âª
âª Arms that reach âª
âª To hold me tenderly âª
You okay there?
I'm fine.
Just not using is...
âª She gives it all to me âª
âª She gives me more âª
Eat something.
âª Than any one man deserves âª
âª l who have everything âª
âª Am nothing without her âª
âª Somehow she knows âª
âª l need her desperately âª
âª She gives it all to me âªâª
Yeah?
That's right, both of them.
All right.
I'm on my way.
You need any help?
No.
You want me to call her back?
No. No.
What exactly did she say? I mean, exactly.
Just, you know, she asked if l was okay and not to worry.
Like that.
Hm. Any rough timetable on this thing, as to when she's coming home?
It's about the gambling, right?
Well, it's kind of hard to--
Dad, she can't understand.
It's not like you're doing this on purpose. You can't help it.
It's not that simple.
Look, you have a disease. It's like you're an alcoholic, right?
No, it's not. Not at all. Yes, it is. l read online.
She's not even allowed to be mad at you.
She can't be mad at you about the cancer, can she?
Son, these are two very different things.
Not really. Gambling addiction is a sickness.
You can't-- Listen, what is going on with me
is not about some disease. It's about choices.
Choices that I have made.
Choices I stand by.
You're not moving back in, are you?
No.
Hey, you know what? School can wait.
Why don't we take a little detour?
What kind of detour?
You'll see.
Charlie, pick up line three.
Line three, Charlie.
I think it's time we got you your own car. What do you think?
What?
I think if you're gonna buy me off,
buy me off.
Get an attendant over to the lot.
âª Make songs that monarchs know âª
âª Ti-ti-ti-la-so-fa Mi-mi-mi-mi-re-do âª
âª Call me Aloe Blacc 'Cause I need that dollar, yo, ha, ha âª
âª Hic-hic-hiccup Blame it on the liquor âª
âª l came through like a stickup Now I'm ballin' like a kick up âªâª
Wow.
Amazing. It's amazing. Yeah. It's good-looking.
That's good. I'm glad you like it.
I do. Thank you, Dad. All right. You're welcome.
So you're here.
Yeah.
You're actually here? To work?
Yeah, man. Jesus.
Jesse.
Come here.
All right, I need an update.
Update on what?
An update on these little field trips that you've been taking with Mike.
I told you already.
We pick up money. Check on things. Stuff like that.
And you're his bodyguard, right? What? That's what you said.
I said l guarded him.
Like backup, like a second set of eyes.
Everybody needs backup, right?
And this has to be you?
It can't be, I don't know, Tyrus or any of the couple dozen muscle-heads
that Gus has working for him?
It has to be Jesse Pinkman.
Why? What, is there something about you that I don't know?
Are you a former Navy SEAL?
Your hands registered as lethal weapons?
Register this.
All l'm saying is that do you not even question this?
Do you really believe that you mean anything to these people?
Not trying to insult. Just trying to make you see things.
I see they can't outright kill me, but they don't want me getting high.
I see this thing probably started as Gus getting Mike to babysit me.
But you know what?
I saved Mike from getting robbed, even killed, maybe.
So maybe I'm not such a loser after all.
I mean, what if it--? Oh, God.
All right. What if it's all just a setup? What?
What if this robbery that you stopped wasn't even real?
I mean, think about it. Your first day out guarding Mike.
He steps out for one second and what happens?
You immediately get robbed. You are such an asshole.
Keep your friends close, your enemies closer.
Like you said, Gus can't kill you because of me, he knows l won't stand for it.
He hates the fact that he needs me.
What does he do? He goes to work driving a wedge between you and me.
If you'd been there, you'd know it wasn't a setup.
Wait a minute. How long did those guys chase you, huh?
Because the way you describe it, they gave up pretty damn easy.
No, no, this whole thing, all of this...
it's all about me.
Hello?
Uh, look, just hang on.
Yeah?
I'll be right up.
What? I gotta go.
What? Am I supposed to clean all this on my own?
Hey.
God--
Ah!
Buenos dias, ladies, buenos dias. Do you speak English?
No. No, okay. Um...
Ah! Help, help. Uh...
I need help to clean. Yes.
Yes, muy bueno. It's just this-- No.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, no, ladies.
Let me see, let me see. I tell you what. I tell you what. Look, look.
Universal language.
This one for you. Yeah, sÃ­.
SÃ­, Presidente Grant. Very important man.
Mas dinero after the--
Are we good?
I think we're good. I think we listened to you. Please, por favor, por favor.
Please, por favor, por favor.
Ah! Yes.
What's the deal?
Well, the deal is, we're watching that house.
Couple down on the left with the tree in the front.
Yeah? What for?
A little birdie told me there's some guys
that have 3 pounds of our product which they're selling.
And which they sure as hell didn't get from us.
So, what's the plan?
I just told you.
We sit here and watch that house
until one of our entrepreneurs pops his head out.
Then we ask a few questions and get our property back.
Why don't you just go break the door down,
pistol-whip those bitches and show them who's boss?
Because a little birdie also told me these guys are into the product
and most likely armed.
Now, what you may not know about meth-heads--
Or maybe you do.
They're kind of unpredictable.
I don't care for unpredictable. So we wait.
Sorry to burst your bubble, kid, but that's 90 percent of the job.
Don't worry. I brought sandwiches.
Yes, sir. Heh.
Uh...
Pimento cheese. How's that sound?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?
You said they're selling right? Maybe I'm looking to buy.
Who the hell are you?
Tucker! Tucker!
I'm here to buy.
Will you shut the damn door?
Not my question.
Name's Diesel. Heard you maybe had some of the blue.
Tucker. Shut the door, Tucker!
I just-- Just looking for a teenth, yo.
Tucker! Tucker!
Come on, help a brother out.
Tucker!
Will you shut the damn door? We don't sell to strangers.
Tucker!
Get off the porch, asshole.
Will you shut the door? All right already!
Tucker!
Guess we'll go with Plan A, then.
Pop the trunk, would you? Why?
There's something in there l need. And what would that be?
I'm getting those pricks out of that house.
Oh, your first attempt being such a wild success?
You may know this whole PI sit-in-the-car business,
but l know meth-heads.
What are you doing?
Digging.
Why?
You know why.
How deep are you going?
I don't know. How deep do you think it is?
Pretty deep.
Hey, uh, you mind taking over for a minute?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, uh, mind if l use your john? Yeah.
Tucker.
Tucker!
Who the hell are you?
I just-- Who the hell are you?
It's cool. Hey, I'm a friend of Tucker's.
What do you want? I just wanna buy some of the blue.
It's not for sale.
I know you were selling it earlier--
Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
Uh, Tucker told me.
Yeah, Tucker needs to learn to keep his damn mouth shut.
Tucker! Tucker!
So, uh, you gonna hook me up?
Don't have enough for all of Tucker's asshole friends. Tucker!
You know, I think he's outside. You wanna just go outside--
Tucker! Tucker!
Hey, hey. Let's go find Tucker.
Okay? Let's go outside.
I don't have enough for you, all right?
Yeah. yeah. Yeah, l get it. Okay.
I don't wanna start any trouble. Trouble? What's that mean? Trouble?
No, no, no. I'm just saying we're cool, okay?
We're good. What?
You can't know that. What does that mean?
You don't put thoughts in my head.
You don't put thoughts in my head. Absolutely. You're right. You're right.
Tucker?
You--
Here you go, Maria.
Veronica.
Ilia, gracias.
I missed that one. I'm sure it was good.
Wait, where you taking them?
Come on, Tyrus, what are you doing? I'm putting them on a bus.
Why? What bus? One that takes them back to Honduras.
Hey, wait a second. Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. This was my idea. Don't punish them.
You tell Gus to blame me, not them.
He does.
âª But I'm not different I'm just me âª
âª And that's the only way That l know how to be âª
Give us a minute, will you?
âª You know, I ain't never Asked for a lot âª
âª And that's about all That l ever got âª
âª But there's one thing That l sure would like to see âª
We won't be too long.
âª When l cash in my final chip âª
âª And they lay me down For my last trip âªâª
The crew that hit our truck gave away the cargo
to a couple local nobodies.
Very disciplined of them, not keeping anything for themselves.
It was all about sending a message.
Which they did, literally.
It was written on the bucket lid.
"Ready to talk?"
That, I believe, is the English translation.
I know you're not really asking for advice.
But let me hire 1 0, 1 5 more good operators.
Then we hit them hard. Hit them where they live.
No. This war stays cold for now.
What about their message? What's the answer?
Set up a meeting. Let's see what they have to say.
How did he do today?
I hear you can handle yourself.
I guess.
Good night.
Hey, excuse me?
Why me?
I like to think I see things in people.
Slow down. The car is not going anywhere.
Mom.
Hey, sweetheart.
Hi. Hey.
Whew.
So did you see what's in the driveway? There you go.
Uh, yeah, l saw.
Hey.
So that's yours, huh?
Yeah. Dad got it for me.
Well, that was very nice of him.
Yeah. Heh.
I know it looks like...
well, awesome, but it's super safe.
Dad made sure.
And I promise to always go the speed limit. Or below.
Way below.
And it gets great gas mileage.
So Dad said l can take it around the block a few times. That okay?
Just around the block.
Yeah. Just around the block.
And be careful, okay? I will.
Bye.
It's really-- lt's really great to have you home, Mom.
Hey, seriously, be careful. Okay?
I will. Okay.
I guess we should talk.
Well, I think you said plenty the other day.
Look, about that, it just...
Did you get the car wash keys?
Um, yes. Yes. Here.
Skyler, I may have overstated things earlier
and I'm sorry to be so forward.
But l just-- l want you to know something.
I want you to--
I need you to understand
that you are safe.
You, Junior, Holly. You are completely safe.
Everything that l do, everything,
I do it to protect this family.
So buying that car, that was protecting your family?
Okay. I...
All right, maybe it's a little flashy, but he needed a car,
and I'm his father, and I should be able to get what he wants.
It goes back.
Tomorrow.
Skyler, it will crush him.
That car directly contradicts our story.
And if you're so invested in protecting this family,
it means protecting the story.
What do you think the neighbors are gonna say, Walt?
What about Hank and Marie?
How about the IRS? What were you thinking, Walt?
I was thinking that l wanted to do something nice for my son.
Look.
I just worry that he'll blame you for this.
Oh, he will.
Once again, he'll blame his bitch mother
for taking away what his loving father has given him,
so thanks for that.
But you know what, Walt?
Someone has to protect this family
from the man who protects this family.

lt came out of nowhere.
You gotta help us.
Look at all this damn water.
Don't drink that.
Ain't no telling if it's gonna be poison.
Nothing new over here.
âª Catch me now l'm falling âª
âª Falling in love âª
âª Two hearts beating in time The rhythm as one âªâª
How's Junior?
Well, exactly what I expected.
He hasn't said a word since we told him it was going back.
I, um, spoke to the dealership, they didn't wanna take it.
What?
It's in perfect condition.
It's got 1 7 miles on the odometer. I know.
I spent an hour sweet-talking the manager down to a restocking fee.
Eight hundred dollars.
Eight hundred dollars? For two days?
Well, the law says they don't have to take it back at all.
All right, here's the registration, the window sticker, the receipt.
Oh, make sure you talk to the general manager.
His name is Glenn.
Glenn.
Call me if there's a problem. And please just don't--
Don't tangle with anyone.
Fine.
Walt.

Yes, hello.
I need a cab.
Yes, thank you. The name is White.
Uh, I'm at the Pavilion parking lot on University.
Oh, yes, that's right. Just south of the airport.
Oh, that would be great, thank you. Oh...
How long do you think that would take?
No, I'm sure he'll see me.
Thank you.
Contrition?
Hey, there is total contrition here.
There's mountains of contrition.
"Fan-tan-tastic." I will messenger them over right away.
Oh, and, ahem, about that other thing unrelated, yes, l can get you in.
But l gotta warn you, the eighth hole is murder.
Oh, yeah. You wanna make it interesting?
Great. Tee time is 7 a.m. sharp.
Prepare to have your ass handed to you.
Okay. Bye.
He was headed for destruction of property.
Since it's your property, I sweated him down to misdemeanor trash burning.
Now, the only thing is it's not gonna be free.
There's a 5 grand fine, 600 for towing and disposal,
3 grand to steam-clean the blacktop.
So bottom line, your little joyride is gonna set you back
about 52,000 bucks.
So was it worth it?
I don't need to hear the blow-by-blow. Just tell me it's done.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did l wake you?
I caught this thing before it got into the system.
Your record stays clean, the wife never finds out.
I've been working magic here. I could at least get an "attaboy."
Fine. Rebel without a cause, give.
What is it? Fring?
He will see me dead.
And there's nothing I can do about it.
All that's left is to wait.
And we're sure about this.
Because Pinkman says he needs you too much.
"Pinkman says." Heh.
"Pinkman says."
Unless...
you could help me find a third party.
What third party?
Someone who can ameliorate the situation.
Let's ditch the thesaurus, all right?
You talking about a hit man?
Assuming that's still what they're called.
Bzzt! Wrong answer.
That's what the kids call "epic fail."
All l would need is a phone number. I'd do the rest.
Saul, there'd be a finder's fee.
A big one.
If you held my feet to the fire, I could come up with names.
One or two guys west of the Rockies who do this work.
But guess what. These guys,
they know Mike and Mike knows them.
Mike knows everyone who does this?
Who do you think gave me their names?
All right. Okay, plan B. Look, we go outside my network.
Craigslist. Soldier of Fortune.
Let's say we get lucky. I mean, incredibly lucky,
and find a guy who's not a cop
or some kind of survivalist nut-job wannabe.
You gotta ask yourself: How good is good enough?
Whatever goombah we buy is gonna come head-to-head with Mike.
And Gus Fring?
Hey, just winging that guy is not gonna "ameliorate" your situation.
Not by a damn sight.
I've tried to solve this, but l can't get anywhere near him.
You can't get near him?
Why don't you ask your partner?
Yeah, I saw him.
And you tell Saul before you tell me?
Look, he's my lawyer, same as yours.
Every time l go over there, Saul hassles me about Mike.
He's still scared the dude's gonna come break his legs.
So I give him the latest.
What happened exactly?
I was at a diner with Mike and he just shows up.
They send me outside and the two of them talk.
That's it.
So this is, like, a regular thing?
How close were you to him?
Close.
I mean, closer than you and me right now.
Did he speak to you?
It was over in 1 0 seconds.
Would you just answer?
He said he sees things in people.
What things?
What people?
Me.
He said he sees something in me.
A month ago, Gus was trying to kill both of us.
And now he pulls you out of the lab and employs you as what?
An assistant gunman?
A tough guy?
Does that make any sense to you?
He says he sees something in you.
What kind of game is he playing?
Does he think you're that naive?
He can't truly think that you'd forget--
Well, let alone Gale, let alone Victor,
and all the horror that goes along with all of that.
What about this girlfriend of yours
and her little brother?
I mean, the man looked you straight in the eye
and told you, "No more children." But that very night, that little boy,
he just--
He winds up...
Gus can't possibly think that you'd forget that.
Okay. All l'm just saying is that
is it possible that he would think that you're that weak-willed?
Drop the sales pitch.
I'll do it.
You'll do what?
I'll kill him.
First chance l get.
âª Maybe someday âª
âª Saved by zero âª
PiÃ±a colada? More like stale bubblegum.
Does anyone want their car to smell like the bottom of a 6th-grader's desk?
Okay. Hemp? Really?
I know. But you know what they say. "The customer is always right."
Speaking of customer, it's not too late to have a grand opening.
I was thinking huge party, balloons, bouncy house for the kids.
You know, make a splash, get on TV.
Let people know they won't face the eyebrows of doom when they come in.
Marie, how's Hank doing?
You know what? He's doing better.
Is he? Yeah. He, uh--
Lately, his mood's improved and he's like a maniac with his PT.
That's fantastic.
Yeah, don't get me wrong, he's got a long way to go, but he--
Yeah. Oh, hey.
Hey. Hi, Walt. It's good to see you. Hey. You too.
Hey, your cashier here is quite the salesperson.
She just talked me into something called the Orbital Paste Wax Buff.
Oh, yeah, it's very important to maintain your clear coat.
Boy, once that's goes...
Oh, yeah.
Um, hi.
Hi.
âª Maybe l'll win âªâª
Bogdan was averaging 1 9 cars during rush hour,
and we are already up to 22. Twenty-two actual cars.
Last night I deposited $3800.
Jesus.
How much is that?
Two hundred seventy-four thousand dollars, give or take.
Give or take? Yeah.
I haven't counted it.
Wait.
Two hundred and seventy-four--
And this is how often?
Every two weeks.
Thursdays good for a drop-off?
But, Walt,
are you telling me you make $7,125,000 a year?
Seven and a half even, before expenses.
But l can't--
That-- This is too much.
So it's more than you thought,
and this is somehow bad news?
No, that's not the point.
I mean, there's no car wash in the world
that could do this kind of business.
I mean, this is nine months' work here, minimum.
Seven million? That could take years.
So set some aside. Save it for a rainy day.
Save it? Where? Save it where?
I can't go to the bank with it. I sure can't leave it here.
Oh. Oy.
Wait a minute.
Is this all 50s?
Who pays for a car wash with a 50? Skyler, I didn't ask you to do this.
I was under the impression that you had this under control.
I just didn't expect this amount of money.
The 50s are gonna be a problem. That's what this is, problem solving.
This is a simple division of labor.
I bring money. You launder money. This is what you wanted.
I never wanted any of this.
I've gotta go.
If you want out, just say that you want out.
Okay, then.
You're telling me you made this in the lab?
Why not?
Making it in his own lab seemed appropriate.
There's not much of it.
We had more for Tuco.
It's enough.
This is still the best way.
You go after him with a gun, you'll never get out of it alive.
But with this,
you slip it into his food or drink.
There shouldn't be any taste or smell.
Thirty-six hours later: "poof."
A man his age, working as hard as he does,
no one will be surprised.
What about Mike?
Mike can have his suspicions, but that's all they'll be.
Please, one homicidal maniac at a time.
I don't know when I'm gonna see Gus again.
I mean, if ever.
Keep it with you.
When you have the opportunity,
be ready.
What if they search me?
Will they do that?
It's the wrong way around.
It's my lucky cigarette.
Well...
whatever you do, don't smoke it.
You know they have a drive-thru, right?
No, this is good.
Could use the exercise, get the blood pumping.
Don't worry, you're not gonna have to pick me up.
Might take me a while, but l'll get there.
Jesus, ain't we a pair.
Hey, you must really like chicken.
V-8, 470 horses, 20-inch rims, satellite radio, Bluetooth.
Zero to 60 in 4.7 seconds.
Whoa, whoa, what do you mean, on a lark?
Spur of the moment, your dad ups and buys you a brand-new Challenger?
Yeah, I barely got it around the block
and Mom said we couldn't afford it, so they took it back.
Do you know how long l had it? Fifteen hours.
Well, hey, buddy, let me tell you something.
When I was your age,
I'd have given my left nut to drive a car like that for 1 5 minutes. Heh.
Seriously, how does that happen?
Well, we were looking at used cars and l kind of--
Ah, you guilted him into it. I know. I hear you.
You pulled the old, "Poor little me and my troubles," am I right?
Maybe. You flew too close to the sun.
You'd have let him buy you a clunker, you'd be driving now
instead of borrowing mom's hooptie.
Agent Schrader.
Hey, how you doing? Well, thank you.
Good to see you. Do you remember Mr. Fring?
How are you? Well. Nice to see you again.
It's a pleasure to see you. You're looking well.
Yeah, well, you know, chalk it up to clean living and vitamin pills.
I must apologize. If I had seen you come in,
there'd have been no question of accepting your money.
In the future, feel free to ask for me.
A DEA hero should never have to pay for a meal at Pollos Hermanos.
No kidding? Well, l'll take you up on that, for sure. Ha-ha-ha.
And how are your mother and father?
They're good.
The chicken is great. Thank you.
If ever you're interested in rewarding part-time work,
perhaps something after school, my door is open.
Sounds good.
Uh, I don't know about this one. He might eat up all your profits.
I'll let you finish your meal. Can l get you anything else?
A refill, perhaps? No, thank you. I'm good.
Sure. Take a Diet Coke, thank you. Of course.
So where are we going?
Oh, big doings today.
The order of the day is eyes open, mouth shut.
What's up?
Test.
You got me?
Count off.
Let's go.
Right here. Leave the wrap on, please.
You know how to make coffee?
Sure.
There you go.
You want a rundown? Please.
Three guys up at the gate, two visible, one in the blind.
We got five guys down here with a backup out of sight.
I got Tyrus down in the tree line with a Barrett .50.
Planted him there last night, in case we had any early arrivals.
I don't have an extra holster.
Stick this in your pocket. Keep it out of sight.
If you're gonna be here today, you're gonna have a gun.
It's loaded?
I don't wanna see that in your hand unless you see me with mine.
Emergency only.
First car is coming.
All right, what's the order of the day?
Eyes open, mouth shut.
A lot of guns.
Nobody's asking you to give up yours.
You wanna sweep the place before you bring in your guys?
I am the guy.
All right, then.
Welcome.
Where is the rest of your party?
I am the only one coming.
And why is that?
My employers feel l can adequately represent their interests.
Please, sit.
This is my offer.
In consideration of our previous relationship...
I will make a one-time payment
of 50 million U.S. dollars.
In return, our business is concluded.
No further payments. No further contact.
An absolute severance.
You have no response?
This is my response:
Yes or no?
You know what the Cartel wants.
Anything else would be a waste of time.
Is it to be yes or no?
A hard way to begin a negotiation.
This is not a negotiation.
You got something of mine?
Glove box.
Figure I better teach you how to shoot.
Could be things are gonna get hairy.
What is this?
I mean, you're giving me a gun,
and now l'm, like, part of the team, or whatever?
He said he sees something in me.
Like what?
If I had to put it in a word,
I'd guess loyalty.
Loyalty.
Only maybe you got it for the wrong guy.
Jesse?
Hey. Hey.
Long time, no see.
How you doing?
Yeah, you know, uh, good.
Good.
Okay, we're gonna get started. You coming in?
So the truth is, we can't change the past, what's done is done.
We've gotta own our actions. But putting ourselves on trial,
acting as our own judge, jury and executioner, it's not the answer.
A lot of the time, all that judging does
is just ensure that we're gonna repeat the cycle.
Right?
"l'm such an asshole.
It's totally hopeless, what's the point?
I think I'll have a hit."
Jesse,
what's going on with you these days?
I, uh, went back to the crystal.
You sober now?
Yeah.
Four days.
Big whoop, right?
Hey, four days is four days.
You're here.
You still
working at the laundry?
How are things there?
Sucks ass.
Anything you wanna talk about?
Um...
A couple of weeks back,
I, uh...
I killed a dog.
You hit it with your car?
No, I, um...
I put him down.
I watched him go.
I was looking him straight in the eye.
He didn't know what was happening. He didn't know why. He--
He was just scared.
And then he was gone.
He was suffering.
It was a kindness.
No, he wasn't sick.
No. He was just, like, uh...
I don't know, like,
a problem dog.
What did he do?
Bite someone?
No, this dog never--
Never bit anybody.
You pick up the rock, you go right to the dark side.
Anything can happen.
It ain't no rock that made me do it.
What was the problem? Why did you kill him?
Watch the crosstalk, please.
Maybe it's not the details that matter, right?
How do you feel about what you did, Jesse?
I don't know.
Who cares how you feel?
What kind of person kills a dog for no reason?
Colleen.
Put an ad in the paper, drop him off at a shelter.
You don't just sit there and talk about killing a helpless, innocent animal.
We're not here to sit in judgment.
Why not?
Why not? Maybe she's right.
Maybe I should have put it in the paper. I should've done something different.
The thing is, if you just do stuff and nothing happens...
what's it all mean?
What's the point?
Oh, right, this whole thing is about self-acceptance.
Kicking yourself doesn't give meaning to anything.
So I should stop judging
and accept?
It's a start.
So no matter what I do,
hooray for me because l'm a great guy?
It's all good?
No matter how many dogs I kill, I just, what, do an inventory and accept?
I mean, you back your truck over your own kid and you, like, accept?
What a load of crap? Hey, Jesse.
I know you're in pain.
No, you know what?
Why l'm here in the first place...
is to sell you meth.
You're nothing to me but customers!
I made you my bitch.
You okay with that?
Huh? You accept?
No.
About time.
Jesse.
Bring a light over here, will you?
Do you see any residue there?
Where?
Here. On the bottom, right there.
It's been a week. What's going on?
I haven't seen him.
I didn't think so. But I'll just give it another shot anyway.
Hey.
Hey, buddy. Look at that.
Graduated to doorman. Finally found your calling. Heh-heh-heh.
Ooh, little whiskers, Marie.
What did you do?
Show your barber a picture of a dog's ass and said, "l'll take that"? Heh-heh-heh.
Charming as usual.
Welcome back.
Looking good, Marie. Oh, thanks, Steve.
Good to see you. How you doing? He's fine. We can take it from here.
Yeah. If you wanna hold his elbow.
No, no, no. You keep your mitts off me. I'm good. I'm good.
Hey.
Good luck.
Let's go, we're running late. Come on.
Hank, seeing you walk in here, I can't tell you what that means to all of us.
Your progress, it's incredible.
Yeah, well, chalk it up to clean living and vitamin pills.
Steve tell you his news? What?
Finally got your period? Heh.
I made GS-14.
Wow, that's all right, man.
Next stop: Washington, D.C. Sitting behind a desk,
papers piled so high, you can't see over them.
Hey, better you than me, buddy.
Seriously, congratulations, buddy.
Thanks.
Steve said you might have something for us.
Yeah, maybe. You guys are gonna have to tell me.
Remember my pal Tim Roberts?
APD detective?
Yeah, well, he's working on a murder case.
The victim's a 34-year-old male Caucasian
by the name of Gale Boetticher.
One night last month, Boetticher opens the door, and, bam,
takes a bullet to the face from a person or persons unknown.
Now, this Gale Boetticher is a bona fide chemistry genius.
I mean, he's got degrees up the wazoo, right?
And, well, as you might expect, he's a nerd's nerd.
Vegan, sandals and socks kind of guy.
As it turns out, he's also an A-number-one meth cook.
And what caught my eye is his specialty product is blue.
So, what are you thinking?
This is your Heisenberg?
No. What I think we got here is, uh, ahem, Heisenberg's former cook
and maybe a line on Heisenberg himself.
Anyway, lo and behold, amidst all the hippie-dippy nonsense, ahem,
I find this.
Now, this here, I do a little Google-fu
and I realize it's a parts number, specifically for this baby.
That there is a high-volume HEPA industrial air filtration system.
That's a 300,000-dollar gadget.
Perfect for a pharmaceutical plant or microchip factory
or maybe the biggest meth lab north of the border.
Okay.
So this little dingus here is manufactured
by a big international concern: Madrigal Electromotive.
I call their Houston office, I get through to the nicest little 20-year-old temp.
I use the Schrader sweet-talk. Before you know it, she's pulling files.
Six months ago, one of these systems was shipped to a depot here in ABQ.
Who signed for it?
Gale Boetticher.
So I asked my new girlfriend, "Who paid for it?" And she says, "Nobody."
They have no record that anybody actually paid for this thing.
So I go back and push more and before you know it
the temp's gone, there's no address.
I'm talking to some snot-nose lawyer who's asking me for my badge number.
Brick wall.
So I take a peek into Madrigal Electromotive.
Now, Madrigal is based in Hanover, Germany,
but they're what they call "highly diversified."
Industrial equipment, global shipping, major construction
and a tiny little foothold in American fast food,
specifically a local chain.
Pollos Hermanos.
Okay. So what, right? Boetticher's dead.
I got no line on who's been bankrolling him
or where his lab was.
The whole thing's a snipe hunt, right?
But now I get this crazy idea
and I can't shake it.
I mean, I stay up nights staring at the ceiling,
trying to make sense of it. That napkin.
I told you Boetticher's vegan.
We're talking this guy makes his own fermented lentil bread,
or whatever the hell that is.
What's a vegan doing in a fried chicken joint?
Maybe he's meeting somebody.
Like who?
Well, like, maybe...
this guy.
I mean, what do we know about Gustavo Fring, huh?
This whole friend-of-law-enforcement thing? Eh.
Could be a case of "keep your friends close but your enemies closer."
He's got the money to finance this operation.
Maybe he's got the connections too. Maybe, just maybe...
he's our guy.
Hank, no offense, but l think you're really reaching.
If your guy had his meeting at KFC,
you wouldn't immediately assume he's sitting down with Colonel Sanders.
You know, I-- Ahem.
I couldn't agree more, guys. Heh.
Gustavo Fring, blue meth, you know.
The whole thing is off-the-map nuts.
I ought to be wearing a tinfoil hat, you know?
Except...
I can't seem to wrap my mind around this one little thing,
and that is, what are Gustavo Fring's fingerprints
doing in Gale Boetticher's apartment?
ï»¿1
Are we done? Listen, I--
This attack on my brother-in-law, I don't know what it means.
Please.
I fear for my family.
I'm sure they'll be fine.
I'm told the assassin that survived is gravely injured.
It's doubtful he'll live.
Now, thank me and shake my hand.
Uh-- Thank you. Thank you again.
You're quite welcome, Mr. White.
Guys, guys, hurry up.
Can we go now?
Upstairs, come on.
What's happening?
Eight forty-three.
Time of death, 20:43.
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.
One of the gunmen died at the scene.
The second succumbed to his wounds earlier this evening.
Agents with the DEA and FBl
in conjunction with APD are working with Mexican law enforcement
in an attempt to identify the deceased suspects. Both--
I can give you the highlights.
Your nephews grew impatient.
They continued to press me for my permission to kill Walter White.
When I wouldn't give it, they settled instead for DEA Agent Schrader.
But a phone call was placed
to Agent Schrader moments before the attack.
Thus giving him the upper hand.
Marco was shot in the face and died instantly.
Leonel lingered for several hours.
The warning call to the DEA agent,
Juan Bolsa may have some insight
into who placed it.
Yesterday, feeerales raided his hacienda.
And in the confusion, Juan was shot dead.
An accident, perhaps.
A mistake made by his own men.
Though we may never know.
At any rate, l thought you should hear it from me.
This is what comes of blood for blood, Hector.
So is this the loud one?
What?
I can never remember.
Is this the loud machine with the magnets?
No. This is the PET/CT scan.
Positron emission tomography.
They've paired that
with computed x-ray tomography.
Quiet. No magnets.
Right, okay.
Yeah, thanks.
I'm still pretty new at this.
One minute, I'm starting a new business,
my wife and I are thinking about kids.
Walk into a doctor's office and suddenly...
I mean, life as I know it-- Excuse me.
Yes. l'm waiting to hear a progress report
on the thing we discussed, so call me.
Anyway, so for me, that's been the biggest wake-up call.
Letting go, giving up control.
You know, it's like they say, "Man plans and God laughs."
That is such bullshit.
Excuse me?
Never give up control.
Live life on your own terms.
Yeah, no, l get what you're saying,
but cancer is cancer, so...
To hell with your cancer.
I've been living with cancer for the better part of a year.
From the start, it's a death sentence. That's what they keep telling me.
Well, guess what?
Every life comes with a death sentence.
So every few months, I come in here for my regular scan,
knowing full well that one of these times--
Hell, maybe even today.
-I'm gonna hear some bad news.
But until then,
who's in charge?
Me.
That's how I live my life.
This residue here is why we descale with cool water
from the walk-in and not water from the tap.
Do it again, please.
Pollos Hermanos, where something delicious is always cooking.
Yes, detective.
Yeah.
Gustavo, thanks for coming.
Pleasure.
How's Kathi? Much better, thank you.
And you know Hank Schrader? Ah. Yes, indeed.
And Steve Gomez? How was your meal?
Agent Schrader and l had a chance to catch up at one of my restaurants.
I'd eat there every day but I wouldn't fit through the door.
Well, should we get started?
Yeah.
I'd like to record this conversation. Of course.
The DEA is working on an investigation which may overlap with my own
so I've asked them to sit in.
Gus, we all appreciate your coming in here to talk to us,
but you have the right to have an attorney present.
Oh, well, l can't see how that would be necessary.
But then, I have no idea why I'm here.
So you wish to continue?
Please. I'm very anxious to find out what this is all about.
Sir, your fingerprints were found at a crime scene.
Really? That's surprising.
A drug-related homicide.
Gale Boetticher's apartment.
So you knew the victim?
Fifteen years ago, I established a chemistry scholarship at UNM.
I named it after Maximino Arciniega,
a dear friend of mine who died young.
Gale was a recipient of this scholarship.
He was perhaps one of three dozen.
I see.
And Mr. Boetticher graduated in...
1 999.
That sounds right.
And you kept in contact with him over all this time?
Oh, no. l hadn't seen Gale for years until I ran into him a few weeks ago.
Ran into him where? At the restaurant.
Uh... Well, "ran into" isn't quite accurate, as l assumed
he came by to re-establish contact with me. We caught up briefly.
He invited me to dinner the following night and l accepted.
It was perhaps a week later when l read about him in the paper.
Drug related, you said? lt's a good possibility.
The paper made no mention of that.
I assumed that it was a random crime.
So after years with no contact, he shows up in your restaurant
and invites you to dinner? He wanted money.
Gale Boetticher asked for money?
He didn't say that.
He spoke in terms of a vague investment opportunity.
But it was my suspicion, yes, as to why he invited me into his home.
He was a very, very talented chemist, but for reasons l never understood,
he was more interested in taking shortcuts
than what would or could have been a very promising career.
Personal shortcomings notwithstanding,
he was a warm, gentle person
and I thought a lot of him.
At any rate, I declined his business offer
and after what was a very pleasant meal, left.
Can you tell us where you were
on the night of Wednesday the 23rd at around 8 p.m.?
Not an accusation, just a question. No, I understand. Let's see.
Twenty-third.
Ah. l was at a fundraiser at Presbyterian Hospital.
I was there from 7 to about 1 0.
Anyone else?
Uh, sorry, yeah. Just one other thing. Um...
Is Gustavo Fring your real name?
Is it my real name?
I know you're a Chilean national,
but there are no records of you ever living there.
Really?
I mean, records show that you immigrated to Mexico in 1 986
and years later, you were granted an entry visa to the United States.
But there's no record of Gustavo Fring ever having existed in Chile,
which I find, l don't know, strange.
Well, no, really, it isn't.
Pinochet's government was guilty of many sins.
First and foremost were human rights abuses.
But it was also notoriously unreliable at keeping records.
I'm sure if you keep digging, you'll find me.
Okay, I think that's it, Gus. Um, thank you.
I hope that I was of some small help.
You were, absolutely. Thank you. You're very welcome.
Good to see you again. Oh, no.
No, please, please. Don't get up. Thanks.
Gentlemen.
So are we buying?
This thing with his name? What are you thinking there?
Sure, the record-keeping in South America's hit or miss.
I mean, we run into that all the time, right?
But we usually find something. Before '86 this guy's a ghost.
If State Department wasn't satisfied, they wouldn't have naturalized him.
Well, maybe, but he emigrated from Mexico in '89.
State just wasn't as tough on background checks pre-9/1 1 .
I don't know what this has to do with the case at hand.
I was curious when his print showed up at Boetticher's apartment.
For me, the scholarship explains it.
I'll admit to a certain degree of bias.
This man has been a longtime friend of DEA.
But that being said, uh, I thought his story was credible.
Well, I agree. I think it was a good story.
Still, why are we hearing it now?
What do you mean?
Well, like you said, he's a-- This man is a big law enforcement booster.
He's reading the newspaper and sees that someone he had dinner with,
someone he thought a lot of was murdered.
He reads this and he doesn't make a phone call?
Didn't call you or one of his other cop friends
to share his connection with the case or ask about the investigation?
We can't predicate a criminal investigation
on a person not making phone calls.
What do you think, Tim?
Well, I wanna follow up on the scholarship, the alibi,
but my overall impression?
I believed him.
Nice touch. Birdbath. Heh.
Hey, tiger, how's it hanging? Good.
Yeah, so very nice.
What's the damage?
Twelve hundred a month. I did a lot of research.
That's a pretty good deal. You kidding me? That's a great deal.
Speaking of which, ahem,
that's for the week.
Plus there's a little extra in there for any move-related incidentals.
Thank you.
Hey, champ, how's the new school? Good.
I loved school when l was your age.
Heh, seesaws, story time, chasing girls with sticks.
It wasn't until the fifth grade that I found out she liked me too,
but by then her family had moved to Scottsdale, so...
Carpe diem, okay? Okay.
All right. Good boy. Heh.
So you'll thank Jesse again from both of us?
You got it.
So is he-- How's he doing? Jesse?
He's good. He's, uh, busy.
How is it?
Space, lots of light. It's-- Little garden out back. It's nice.
And Brock? How's he doing?
Hey, look, I don't mind dropping checks off every week
like Ed McMahon,
but if you wanna know how they're doing,
why don't you go see for yourself?
I'll catch you later.
Hey, you gonna need a ride home?
No.
Great.
Anyway, I'm proud for not losing my cool.
Plus, it shows our crew that I will support them
if a customer's being rude.
You're really taking to this whole be-your-own-boss thing.
Yeah. I guess I am.
Actually,
I'm thinking about making the move up to management.
Mm.
Oh, Jesus. Corporate America, look out.
Excuse me, l would be a vast improvement.
No one in Kleinman's entire front office knows about giving an x-ray,
which is just... Ugh.
Hey, Dad, whatever happened with your scan?
Did you get the results back?
Yeah, I did,
and I'm still in remission.
So you're all gonna have to be stuck with me for a while longer.
Cheers, buddy.
What about you, Hank? How you feeling these days?
Ah, you know, getting there.
The other day, he had a big powwow with all the DEA muckety-mucks.
What was that about?
Nothing. Just a dead-end.
He won't tell me, either.
Apparently, it's all very hush-hush.
Hey, Walt, do me a favor?
Uh, Marie's working tomorrow and there's a gem and mineral show
opening at the fairgrounds. I wondered if you could give me a lift?
Yeah. Sure.
I had a collection of my own in high school.
I mean, nothing fancy. Just entry-level beryls and garnets,
one passable black tourmaline.
Turn right here. Okay.
But l did have one piece of morganite that was very special.
It'd been heat-treated, so it had that classic cast to it.
That rose, almost salmon hue, you know?
Hey, Walt, there's no rock show, okay?
I just said that so Marie wouldn't freak. Here. Take a right here.
Freak about what?
Hank, where are we going?
Are you hungry?
We're not here for the chicken.
Kill the engine.
All right. Ha-ha-ha.
You ready for your mind to be blown?
Uh, sure.
Gustavo Fring, remember him?
He came to the hospital after the shooting. Put up the reward?
He sponsors the DEA Fun Run every year. You've met him?
Yeah, the Fun Run guy. Yeah. That guy, yeah. What about him?
Well, I suspect-- I can't prove it, mind you, but l suspect
the man's a drug dealer.
Hmpf.
Yeah. Methamphetamine.
I mean, honest to God, I really believe
that this guy may be one of the biggest movers in the southwest.
Remember Gale Boetticher?
That sad sack from the karaoke tape? Yeah.
And you said that he didn't strike you as being the boss-man type?
That there was a bigger guy out there.
Hank, that was just speculation.
Doesn't matter. It made me keep at it.
And guess what I find?
Chicken Man's fingerprints at Boetticher's murder scene.
So we bring him in-- You think that Gustavo Fring
killed Gale Boetticher?
Probably not.
These guys usually get a dunce to pull the trigger, right?
But his fingerprints being there was enough to bring him in. So I--
So you brought him in to the police?
Right. He sits down to talk with us, the problem is that--
What did you ask him? What did he say?
Walt, will you let me finish my story here?
Sorry, l'm just, uh, interested, you know?
All right. Whatever. So we bring him in and he proceeds to kick our asses.
Okay? He's got an explanation for the fingerprints.
He's got an alibi for Gale's murder. He's got reasons for everything.
This guy is Terms ofEneearment convincing.
So he's not guilty?
Yeah. As far as DEA and APD are concerned, he's not.
Officially, Fring's not a suspect.
But l'm telling you,
something deep down says he's my guy.
Just gotta prove it.
Hank, why are you telling me this?
I need a favor.
What favor?
You see that Volvo station wagon over there?
The guy drives a 1 0-year-old Volvo. It's brilliant.
Anyway, listen,
what I need for you to do,
stick this on it.
GPS tracker.
Wifey thinks hubby's screwing around on her but she wants to be sure?
Stick this on the car-- This part here, it's a magnet.
-and see where he goes.
Cool, huh?
Two eighty-nine from SkyMall. Ha, ha.
It's not live-view, so we gotta come back later
and take it off and stick it in the computer.
Still, a pretty amazing time we're living in.
Hank, isn't that illegal?
I mean, isn't there some sort of unlawful search and something--
It's known as extralegal. But trust me, it's our little secret.
Look, it's easy, okay? Here's what you do.
You untie your shoelace and you head toward the restaurant.
You're walking past the car,
look down and, "Hey, darn, my shoe's untied." Okay?
Now, when you bend down to tie your shoe,
you stick this into the wheel well.
Then you go inside and I don't know-- Hank, I don't feel good about this.
I know that this kind of thing is outside your comfort zone--
No, I mean it. This is a mistake.
Walt, I need you to help me out here, okay?
This is really important to me.
Are you gonna make me beg? Come on. Just stick it in there.
Yeah.
Just act normal.
May I help you?
I-- I--
Sir, may l help you?
I didn't do it. See?
I didn't do it. Do it.
Do it.
May I help you with your order?
What the hell is he...?
Just, uh, made sure it was secure.
Hey, where's my soda?
Just kidding. Let's go. Let's go.
Yes, that one.
I swear to God, I thought I was driving the man to a gem and mineral show.
And all of a sudden he has me pulling into your restaurant
and telling me that he's investigating you.
Look, you and I, we've had our differences,
but l would never--
Look, my brother-in-law, evidence-wise, has nothing.
He's operating on pure conjecture.
And no one, not one person that he works with
thinks that you are anyone other than an owner of a fast-food chain.
But if something were to happen to Hank?
That would only draw their attention to you and therefore, to me, as well.
We have a mutual interest in resolving this without violence.
I will make sure that he discovers nothing.
Jesse!
What? Oh, hey. Don't wait to be, like, invited.
Are we alone?
So where do we stand? Where do we stand on what?
Where do we stand with the thing that you were supposed to do?
I assume you haven't done it.
You didn't lose it, did you? You would tell me if you lost it, right?
Oh, Jesus.
Asshole. You're creaming to get it done, go do it yourself.
If he didn't see me coming like he's some kind of...
All right, look. Our timetable has advanced.
You have got to make this meeting happen this week.
Tomorrow. Tonight, if possible.
Oh, tonight. Wow. What are you, high?
My brother-in-law, my DEA agent brother-in-law?
He's onto Gus.
Huh.
Did you hear what I just said? My brother-in-law is onto Gus.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, l got it, your brother-in-law. Okay, I'm thinking.
Look. Um, so, what if this is like math or algebra?
We add a plus douche bag to a minus douche bag
and you get, like, zero douche bags.
I've got some math for you.
Hank catching Gus equals Hank catching us.
Hank, he's relentless, all right? He won't quit.
Yeah, well, he's got nothing, is all l can say.
How would you know that? Because he's still above ground.
Think a dude like Gus would let your boy anywhere near him?
He'll break out his box cutter on his sorry gimp ass.
So you haven't even seen him since that time at the diner?
Okay.
Think. All right.
They've got to be figuring that we've talked.
So you need to tell Mike that you are worried about Hank's investigation.
Okay? Hank already knows who you are, by the way.
And besides, you actually did kill Gale, so there's that.
This is all good fodder for you to request a sit-down with Gus
so you can discuss what you would say for questioning.
Okay? Now, you just say that you want to be--
No, that you need to be able to be properly coached.
Then, when you're near him,
you put this to use.
Mike's just gonna tell me to shut my mouth if I get busted.
He ain't gonna set up no meeting. Well, then insist on it, damn it!
Act panicked.
Gus' ass is on the line.
He'll meet with you if he thinks you're a liability.
No. He will waste me if he thinks l'm a liability.
You know what?
Whatever, man.
I'm gonna take a piss.
I think you, um, got a phone call.
Anything important?
Yes?
I did some digging around.
And?
Neither the DEA
nor the APD considers you a person of interest.
Schrader is looking into you totally on his lonesome.
A voice in the wilderness. Does he have resources?
Just him, his credit card and his chauffeur Walter.
He'd be committing career suicide if he were to mention you to Merkert again.
No warrant for that tracking device?
No.
The guy has gone totally maverick. He's Miss Daisy with binoculars.
We watch our backs, we don't throw him any bones.
He'll never make a case.
What about Chile? If l can't find any trace before '89,
I seriously doubt Schrader can.
Seems to me the bigger problem is the cartel.
Now, we can handle them if that's all we've got on our plate.
But dealing with both Schrader and the Mexicans at the same time?
If he happens to be watching when they make a move,
it could be the perfect storm.
Thank you.
I'll be in touch.
I don't know how many grandmas and grandpas we got.
Is there a couple of them out there in viewing land?
Well, it's "The Grandparent's Polka."
Hello, Hector.
Hm.
The cartel has given me its ultimatum.
To which I've said no.
DEA Agent Schrader, he's a concern.
He's looking into my past.
âª Now it's time to do The grandparent's polka âª
âª And maybe tell a story or two âª
âª About the great times That we had together âª
âª And all the things That we used to do âª
Is today the day, Hector?
Gustavo, sit down.
You're making me nervous.
It's a good plan. Trust yourself.
Everything is going to be okay.
Are you crazy?
The boss is gonna rip your balls off!
What, you gonna tell?
And you?
They ain't gonna say nothing.
They like what they see.
You're not going to offer our guests anything?
Who says they're guests?
If the boss wants them to drink,
they drink.
So...the Chicken Brothers.
I like your restaurant.
Dark meat and white meat?
Don't look like no brothers to me.
At last! The master chefs!
You two...
That chicken you cook...
I swear, it has got to be the tastiest chicken in all of Mexico.
Thank you, Don Eladio.
It's a great honor.
Max is the chef.
The compliments are all his.
Gustavo is too modest.
There'd be no restaurant without him.
Well, however you two do it, keep it up.
Your chicken, it's so...zesty.
Piquant.
But it does not taste like a Mexican style.
It's a recipe I learned in Chile
which I've modified a bit for the Mexican palate.
I bet we like a little more chili than you Chileans.
We Mexicans like a good hard kick!
So...if your partner is the chef,
then who are you?
Don't tell me you are just the taster!
I handle the business operations.
Gustavo is a brilliant businessman.
Ahh. Es el businessman. Ha, ha.
Good, good. Mm.
But tell me something.
That chicken, so fabulous,
so excellent...
Besides that, what else do you have on your menu?
We have several side dishes.
Rice. Beans.
Sometimes we prepare a carnitas entrÃ©e
if we come across fresh beef in the market.
Anything else?
Come on, be honest.
There is nothing else you offer? A little taste of something else?
Something on the side?
Because when I send my men to your restaurant,
they come back with more than just chicken.
They come back with drugs.
Regresan high.
You are selling them narcotics.
Methamphetamine.
With all due respect, Don Eladio.
I didn't sell it to them.
I gave them samples.
Samples.
Some businessman.
I gave them samples to give to you.
To introduce you to our product.
Don Eladio, Gustavo meant no offense.
But he... That is to say we
could think of no other way to get your attention.
We want to work with you, Don Eladio.
I know all about methamphetamine.
That's poor man's cocaine.
Only bikers and hillbillies use it.
There's no money in it.
May I, Don Eladio...
I am a biochemist by training.
The methamphetamine we make is much superior
to the so-called biker crank you know of.
It is crystallized, like glass.
Purer.
And the chirality of the molecule,
its very structure, is different.
The narcotic effect is far more potent.
This product is the drug of the future.
Ahh.
It'll triple your profits.
Perhaps quadruple.
They're not only good cooks,
they're great at shoveling manure.
Right now, you deal almost exclusively with cocaine.
But the coca plant can't grow in Mexico.
You are no more than middlemen
for the Colombians.
They cut you a percentage for smuggling across the border.
But the lion's share of the profits goes to them
despite your assumption of all the risk.
This new crystal methamphetamine...
It's stronger, more addictive than cocaine,
which means it will move in higher volume.
But most importantly, it's completely artificial.
We can show you how to manufacture it
right here in Mexico.
And you keep all the profits.
My men do like your product.
Hector,
what is wrong with you?
Why did you not get glasses for our guests?
Go on.
You are quite the talent.
I bet you learned cooking from your mama. Isn't that true?
But...what about the chemistry?
I studied at the University of Santiago.
Gustavo paid for my education.
Oh, really?
I have degrees in both biochemistry and chemical engineering.
With minimal capital investment,
we can set up a factory-grade laboratory for you.
Train your own people to manufacture large quantities
of highly pure methamphetamine.
Fantastic!
Tell me one thing, though.
If you're the cook...
Why do l need him?
SeÃ±or?
You.
Businessman.
Why should l negotiate with someone who doesn't respect me?
Who insults me by dealing under my nose without my permission?
Who manipulates me into a meeting
in front of my own men?
What do l need you for?
Don Eladio. Please.
I didn't sell anything.
I apologize if you are offended
by my method of obtaining this meeting.
I merely took the initiative.
I meant no insult.
Don Eladio, Gustavo didn't mean to offend.
I know Gustavo like a brother.
He's an honorable man.
The most loyal man I have ever known.
He rescued me from the Santiago slums.
He made me the man l am today!
Gustavo is a genius. He will make you millions!
Just find it in your heart to forgive him this one small mistake.
Please...
He's my partner.
I need him! l swear to God!
Look at him. You did this to him.
Now, look at him.
Listen to me.
The only reason you are alive and he is not
is because l know who you are.
But understand...
You are not in Chile anymore.
My advice...
Stick to chicken.
Huh?
âª Right here in Verona with you âªâª
Look at me, Hector.
Look at me.
Maybe next time.
ï»¿5
I got it, I got it.
You're like a bee at a damn picnic, Marie.
Bzzz.
Morning. Hey, buddy.
Ready to get your rocks on? See? I knew it.
"Mineral show" is just some sort of guy code for "strip club." Huh?
Yeah. You got your singles? Heh, heh.
Got it? Yeah.
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?
Cram one more giant geode in here, we'll be sleeping in the garage.
Got it. I got it.
I'm sorry.
Christ. Longest week ever. Ha-ha.
Here's just hoping we get something good.
Keep your fingers crossed.
Relax, buddy, this ain't no spy movie.
It's more like Rocky, you know?
Get the bad guy.
Yeah!
âª 'Cause it's the eye of the tiger It's the thrill of the fight âª
âª Rising up âªâª
But-- But-- What are you doing, buddy?
Leaving.
You gotta go inside, order something like last time. Avoid suspicion.
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.
We'll use the drive-through.
All right, baby, let's see what we got.
What the hell? Look at this. Bump, bump, bump. bump, bump.
That's work. That's home. That's work, that's home.
What, this guy,
he goes two places every day, all week?
It's unbelievable.
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.
Hank, is it possible that maybe, just maybe,
he's not your guy?
A guy this clean has got to be dirty.
What's the play here, buddy?
How do l get this guy?
Yeah.
How?
Yes, hi.
I live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place and I want to report
a very suspicious man lurking in my neighborhood.
He's sitting in a blue sedan,
and he's been staring at a particular house for a very long time.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
If you would, l would appreciate it.
All right.
I guess we'd better get started.
I already did.
Yeah?
Hey, uh...
Got one of those for me?
One of those what? Cigarette.
Look, it's still in there, all right? I didn't get a chance yet.
Just give me one.
Hmm.
So, what have you been up to?
What?
You know, just a day in the life. What do you do after work?
Go home. Watch TV.
What do you watch?
I don't know, stuff.
Well, like what?
Like, uh, Ice Road Truckers.
Ice Road Truckers.
What happens on that one?
Guys drive on ice.
Hmm.
Heh.
I am gonna do it.
You gotta inhale, by the way.
What the hell, man? Don't you have enough cancer already? Look.
I said
I'd do it. l'll do it.
Yeah, well,
what does it matter?
We're both dead men anyway.
Hi.
Hi.
Am l catching you at a bad time?
No. I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm-Almost-Sixteen-Leave-Me-Alone
doesn't want a big birthday, just wants to hang out with friends,
which is fine by me. You? Fine by me.
Okay. So l figured a low-key family dinner, no official party,
and we bite the bullet,
and buy him a car.
Used, I was thinking, would be best.
But no more than five years old. Airbags, safety-rated, all that.
Do you have any thoughts on what kind?
Or should I just go ahead and--
Yeah. You just go ahead.
Okay.
Listen, on another subject, I just wanted to tell you
that business is good.
Really good.
So good that l'm thinking, maybe,
you don't need to even work
your second job.
You're turning a profit? We're coming close.
Give us another month or two and, uh, yeah, we'll be there.
All of this to say,
maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
I'm working on it.
Okay.
Hello?
Hey, buddy. Wake you?
No, Hank. I'm up.
Oh, good, uh... What you doing?
l'm, uh...
Hey, listen, I'll cut to it. Another favor to ask.
I'm thinking about Gus Fring. How he never goes anywhere.
One restaurant, home, back and forth? I'm even more convinced it's bullshit
because he owns 1 3 other restaurants. Right?
So I start thinking about this little empire of his.
Fourteen restaurants. Who supplies them? What's the base of operations?
So I do a little digging, and bingo.
Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center.
lt's not far from town.
The place is huge. I mean,
I'm looking at it online now. It's a big warehouse
and rows of these long, poultry buildings,
or hatcheries, whatever you call them.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity. Sounds promising, right?
Huh.
So, what do you say, buddy? Got another field trip in you? Heh-heh.
Uh...
You know, Hank, I'm-- I'm-- l'm--
I mean, it sounds great, it really does. But l'm--
You know, I won't lie. Um...
You've caught me somewhat...
indisposed.
What do you mean, like taking-a-dump indisposed?
Yeah. That's embarrassing.
That's it. Um--
You know, it's just upset stomach and, you know, everything--
Yeah. lt's out of control.
And it's really explosive. Bad Tex-Mex
at the mall. Yeah, yeah, yeah. l get it.
You don't have to paint a picture.
One guy in a diaper is enough for this trip.
Yeah, and I'm sorry, Hank. Hey, don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately. I appreciate it. I'll find another ride.
Uh...
Another ride? Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me. Uh--
My trainer, Chuck. Maybe I'll ask him.
Well, look, I'm-- This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
Maybe 48 hours at the most.
And do you think you can possibly hold off for a day or two?
Jeez, buddy, l mean, l, uh...
You know, I just-- I would just really
love to be the one to be able to take you there.
And, l mean, l've just really
enjoyed, you know, the time with you
and helping you and-- Well, yeah.
Okay, sure. If it means that much to you. Ha-ha.
Just, you know, give me a call when you're feeling up to it.
Thank you. l will. Okay.
Bye.
Yeah.
Uh, Mike, listen.
I just want to say first off, don't be angry.
What is it, Walter?
My brother-in-law, my DE-- He...
Soon, he will probably, in the near future,
take a ride out to a certain distribution center
to look around for things.
Just...
look around for things. And, yeah.
Uh...
Mike?
Where's this all going? Elsewhere.
Thank you. Please give this to your car-care professional.
âª And they're messing With my heart âª
âª Won't stop messing With my heart âª
âª Ripping me apart âªâª
So a hand wax for you today?
Okay, great.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
And the black Explorer, we could shampoo your floor mats,
but deluxe detailing is the best for your buck.
Oh, and SUV's are extra.
And please give this to your car-care professional.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
Hey, Sky.
Oh, my God. Ted.
What are you, uh...?
Someone from the office, uh,
said you worked down here. So I thought I'd come down and say hi.
Wow. Well, uh,
hello. Ha-ha-ha.
You look great.
No. No, l don't. I probably just look crazed.
Not at all. You look happy.
Last time l saw you, um...
Hi, there.
Um, l guess, Skyler, um,
I'm gonna need to talk to you.
Uh, Ted, I really don't think we have anything to talk about.
Actually, we do.
An audit? Wait, an audit tomorrow?
How long have you had this? Um, a while.
I debated, you know, contacting you.
Contact me? What about a lawyer, Ted?
Ted, this is...
This is the CID.
The criminal division.
My God, you're facing a felony charge here.
A $1 00,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe,
plus five years in prison. Yeah. Ahem.
It's bad. Yeah.
It most certainly is.
Look, here's the thing. I was wondering, maybe,
if you could help with this.
Help?
Help how?
Well, with your knowledge of how the books
got the way they are, maybe there's some way
you could undo what's in there.
You want me to uncook your books?
Maybe there's some method or some accounting trick you could use--
Ted, it doesn't work like that.
The damage is already--
My name.
My signatures
are all over those books.
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.
Let me explain what's going to happen here, okay?
Once the ClD sees this is willful tax fraud,
they will build the strongest possible case against you.
Once they start down that path, they have an 80 percent conviction rate.
That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail,
and tap your phones, and not just you, Ted,
everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay? They're after me.
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
No offense.
I'm sorry. l, uh...
Look, I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'm going to figure out a way through this, somehow. Okay?
Here.
So is he gonna kill him?
Is who gonna kill who?
Gus.
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
I mean, he's the reason for all of this here, right?
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
A-hole DEA agent poking around your junk.
Who needs that, right?
Makes sense to get rid of him for good.
But killing a cop,
I don't know.
It could look suspicious
if the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
Then there's-- There's Mr. White,
who would be even more apeshit if he had family getting murdered.
He'd never cook for Gus again.
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
If something were to happen to him, would you have a problem with that?
Who really cares what l think?
Son of a bitch.
You get comfortable, kid. We may be here a while.
Hey.
Get down!
Tell them...
...the answer is "yes."
Should I even ask? I wouldn't.
So, what? ls this going to be a regular thing now?
Meth cooking and corpse disposal? Jesus.
Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
What was it this time?
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
Or did Gus need to send another message?
Shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse. Just get the barrel.
And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again,
you go ahead and get two barrels.
Yo. Like, um...
I guess l never thanked you for what you did.
Thanks.
Next time don't stand there like an idiot.
Move your feet. Running and so forth.
But seriously, what--?
What was the deal with Gus? The deal?
That Terminator shit. Walking right into the bullets.
What the hell was he doing?
The cartel needs Gus.
His distribution network. They're not looking to kill him.
But, what? The rest of us are like open season?
Is he doing anything about that, or do we keep hanging out
for target practice while he--? Kid.
Enough. You got questions, ask him yourself.
And here again.
Unreported income.
That's more than a year straight so far.
You want to say something about this? I'm having a hard time figuring it out.
I'd have to, um,
have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke. That's why we're here.
Oh, I am so sorry l am late.
I got lost. Hey, Ted.
Sky. Whoo.
This building is so confusing.
There are doors everywhere.
Hi. You are...? Special Agent James Bekaris.
Ooh. "Special." Skyler White.
Ms. White, you are the accountant of record
for many of these reports, is that correct?
Guilty as charged. Can you shed light
on this history of missing revenue?
Missing? No, it's there. Mm-hm.
No. Revenue most definitely flowed through this company,
but it's not all accounted for in your reports.
Huh.
Mm. Let's take a look.
Mm. Oh, well, you know,
this account here, that is Mr. Keller's account.
And Mr. Keller is an old friend of Ted's dad.
He always sends an electronic payment,
which I hate, because l'm a real-paper person.
Mr. Keller is one of those environmental people.
Since there wasn't a physical check,
I didn't enter it into the book. But the money is there.
Ms. White, you've read Section 61 of the IRC?
I did not follow what you just said.
How gross income for a business is defined, you're not allowed to do that.
Well, I think I am. No, you're not.
Well, you know what they say about opinions, right? Everyone's got one.
But seriously, I am.
It doesn't matter if it's an electronic check or a paper check,
income is income. You're not allowed to not declare it.
When I input everything into the Quicken,
nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?
Quicken. Mm-hm.
You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.
I did. Do you guys use that here? Because it is the best.
It's like having a calculator on your computer. Amazing.
Ms. White, how did you get this job? Ted hired me.
No, I mean your qualifications.
What are your qualifications? Where did you get your training?
Ooh. Well, I haven't had any training, per se.
I've always been naturally good with numbers.
Got a good instinct for them. Right, Teddy?
Uh...
Right.
This is all falling into place now.
Ms. White, l just have to ask. You're not managing accounts
anywhere else, are you? Right now? No.
I'm a cashier at a car wash.
I'm not really clear about what happened in there.
What happened was good news.
Ignorance of the law
doesn't equate to criminality. It equates to ignorance.
Pay your back taxes, pay the penalties,
and move on from this. Just put it behind you.
Pay with what?
I owe them $61 7,000. What am l--?
Look, just figure it out, all right? And you've just dodged prison.
Sell your assets. Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage--
Second mortgage? I have a lien on my house.
I don't have any assets. There are no assets left to sell.
Ted, if you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation,
and that little fiction l just spun up there is gonna completely unravel.
You have to settle.
Wish I could.
Come in.
I hope you brought an appetite.
Yeah, I guess.
Mike mentioned you have some questions.
Yeah.
We'll eat first, and then we'll talk.
Right on.
What am I doing here?
I know you have concerns.
What happened yesterday, to my man at the farm,
it was a terrible thing.
The dude getting his head blown off? Yeah.
I've invited you into my home,
prepared food so we could sit and talk.
Discuss what's going on in this business,
our business, like men.
And I will explain everything that is happening.
I will answer your questions.
But first,
I need you to answer one question for me.
Can you cook Walter's formula?
What?
Walter's formula.
Can you produce his product without any help? Alone.
No.
Why?
You're asking me if I can cook Mr. White's crystal?
Without him?
Me?
The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago.
This your plan? Huh?
Invite me in your house, make whatever this is,
be my buddy,
and make me feel important.
Then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. White?
You wanna-- You wanna talk like men?
Let's talk like men. You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
That is not what I asked you.
You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.
I need you to help prevent an all-out war.
Now, if you would,
answer the question.
Hey, you headed out?
Yeah.
Yo, Mr. White, hey. I really gotta talk to you. l don't know if you're
with your family or whatever, but this is important,
so l'm hoping you could come over.
Thank God. Come on in.
You-- You want a beer or something? No.
Should I sit down? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, go ahead.
Okay, so, um...
Okay, so word has come down that they--
They want me to go to Mexico.
There's some-- Some sort of war brewing
between Gus and the cartel. "Word has come down"?
The cartel has been-- Has been messing with Gus' operation.
Like jacking trucks to, like, send a message.
And yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab.
I mean, they shot him right in front of me. Just blew his head open.
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
Anyway, they've been holding them off.
But between the cartel taking potshots
and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal,
it's like what you call a rock-and-a-hard-place situation.
So, Gus is-- Is gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation,
and they want your formula. And he's gonna give it to them.
Well, I-- I gotta give it to them. I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico
and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
You know, and Gus doesn't trust you,
so I gotta go. I mean, you're the chemist, man,
you know, not me. I mean, let's say l go down to--
You know, go over there. Go to the jungle or whatever,
and they got like actual chemists,
like cartel chemists asking me chemistry stuff
that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you.
And what if all the equipment is in Mexican instead of English?
You know? I don't know. Ugh. I don't know.
I mean, if l mess this up,
I'm dead, you know? All of us.
Mr. White, look, l need-- I need your help.
Okay, maybe you could-- Maybe you could coach me
or something, you know. Or give me some notes.
Mr. White?
So you saw Gus?
What? No.
You didn't see Gus. No.
Then who told you all of that?
It was passed down, like I said.
"Passed down." By whom?
By, uh... By Mike and them.
I mean, they did. They-- So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus. You haven't seen Gus. You haven't spoken to Gus.
Why are you--? You weren't at Gus' house last night.
What?
What the hell? Jesus.
Still here.
It's still here. Jesus.
You look me in the eye and you tell me
that you weren't at his house last night.
I, um...
Look, I didn't have a chance, all right?
Okay? l knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me.
That's why I didn't say anything.
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew.
He just made this one big pot and we both ate from it.
What was l supposed to do, poison myself?
Two hours, 1 8 minutes, and you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him?
He never left the room. You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do, one thing.
That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives,
and you were right there. You were in his house,
and you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 1 8 minutes?
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?
This. This is how l knew.
You bugged my car? 7:1 0 to 9:28 p.m.
Two hours and 1 8 minutes. But you had no intentions, did you?
Not the slightest intention.
Everything that l have done for you. Ugh!
You put a bug on my car?
I'm sorry, after everything you've done for me?
What you've done for me?
You killed me, is what you've done!
You've signed my death warrant! Now you want advice? I'll give you advice:
Go to Mexico and screw up like l know you will. Wind up in a barrel somewhere!
Argh!
You son of a--
Can you walk?
Yeah.
Then get the fuck out of here and never come back.

Oh, my God. Christ!
Shit.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Think, think, think.
Oh, my gosh.
Okay. Come on, come on, come on.
Come on.
My name is Walter Hartwell White.
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.
To all law-enforcement entities,
this is not an admission of guilt.
I am speaking to my family now.
Skyler.
You are the love of my life.
I hope you know that.
Walter Jr.
You're my big man.
There are... There are going to be some things...
Things that you'll come to learn about me
in the next few days.
I just want you to know that no matter how it may look
I only had you in my heart.
Goodbye.
Money before the panel earlier this year.
Happy birthday.
Oh.
Look at that.
That is veggie bacon.
Believe it or not. Zero cholesterol
and you won't even taste the difference.
Mm.
What time do you think you'll be home?
Same time.
I don't want him dicking you around tonight.
You get paid till 5, you work till 5. No later.
Aha.
Hey.
Hey, happy birthday. Well, thank you.
You're late again.
There was no hot water again.
I have an easy fix for that.
You wake up early,
and then you get to be the first person in the shower. Hm.
I have an idea.
How about buy a new hot-water heater?
How's that idea? For the million-billionth time.
Did you take your echinacea?
Yeah.
I think it's getting better.
What the hell is this?
Hey. It's veggie bacon.
We're watching our cholesterol, I guess.
Not me. I want real bacon. Not this fake crap.
Too bad. Eat it.
Phew. This smells like Band-Aids.
Eat it.
So how does it feel to be old?
How does it feel to be a smart-ass?
Heh. Good.
Eat your veggie bacon.
You're all set? Yeah, I'm fine.
All right, see you at home. Okay, see you.
Chemistry.
It is the study of what?
Anyone?
Ben. Chemicals.
Chemicals.
No.
Chemistry is...
Well, technically, chemistry is the study of matter.
But I prefer to see it as the study of change.
Now, just... Just think about this.
Electrons.
They
change their energy levels.
Molecules.
Molecules change their bonds.
Elements. They combine and change into compounds.
Well, that's... That's all of life, right?
I mean, it's just... It's the constant, it's the cycle.
It's solution, dissolution, just over and over and over.
It is growth, then decay,
then transformation.
It is fascinating, really.
Chad.
Is there something wrong with your table?
Okay, ionic bonds.
Are you done?
Ionic bonds. Chapter six.
One, two, three makes 10, and 10 makes 20.
There's your receipt.
Just hand this claiming disc to your car-wash professional.
Thank you. Come again.
He's not coming. He says he quits.
I'm gonna run the register.
Bogdan, no. We talked about this.
I'm short-handed, Walter. What am I to do?
Walter?
What am I to do?
Hey, Mr. White.
Make those tires shine, huh?
Oh, my God.
You will not believe who's cleaning Chad's car.
Mr. White.
From chemistry.
Surprise!
Happy birthday, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
Oh, you're so very late.
Really, I'm serious, Skyler.
I mean, you're flat as a washboard.
Oh. You look awesome.
She's not showing at all, is she?
She's showing a little.
Carmen, this is my sister, Marie.
Nice to meet you. Hi.
Glock 22, that's my daily carry, okay?
I mean, unless you're talking, what, Plus P Plus loads,
you can forget the 9 mil, all right?
Shit, I seen one of those bounce off a windshield one time.
Yeah, with you shooting. Hey.
If you're gonna bring a gun, baby,
you gotta bring enough gun.
Forty caliber.
Uh...
This is awesome. Nice, isn't it?
Yeah. Dad, come check this out.
Yeah, I see it.
Come on, take it.
Yeah. Check it out, Walt.
Ooh.
No, no, it's just heavy.
That's why they hire men.
Hey, it's not gonna bite you.
Looks like Keith Richards with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he?
Hey, Walt. Everybody, listen up, listen up, listen up.
I'm gonna give a toast,
a little toast to my brother-in-law. Come here.
Walt, you got a brain the size of Wisconsin
but we're not gonna hold that against you.
But your heart's in the right place, man.
Your heart's in the right place. We love you, man. We love you.
Everybody, to Walt.
Oh, shit. Turn on channel three.
At which point, we apprehended three individuals
and placed them into custody.
I'm proud to say the outstanding professionalism
of my fellow agents at the Albuquerque District Office
resulted in a substantial amount of methamphetamine
being taken off the streets.
Were any shots fired?
No, ma'am.
Our agents took the suspects by surprise.
Damn. The TV does add 10 pounds.
Ten pounds?
Hey, sit and spin, both of you.
Hank. What?
Sorry. You didn't see that.
So charming.
Clearly an ongoing operation. One which was well-organized...
Hank, how much money is that?
It's about 700 grand.
It was a pretty good haul.
As I say, it's a good day for the citizens of Albuquerque
Wow.
When we can put this big a dent in the local drug trade.
Well, that's unusual, isn't it? That kind of cash?
Mm. Well, it's not the most we ever took.
It's easy money, till we catch you.
Heh-heh.
Walt, just say the word and I'll take you on a ride-along.
You can watch us knock down a meth lab, huh?
Get a little excitement in your life.
Yeah, someday.
Which one's this?
Um, that faux-Lalique vase I picked up at the Super-Swap.
Oh.
How's it doing?
Well, I met my reserve and there's still two minutes.
Oh.
What's up?
You tell me, birthday boy.
Oh, hey, so, what's up for Saturday?
Mm. Car wash. Bogdan says he needs me.
Till what time? Noon, 1 -ish?
Probably 2, more like it.
And then what after that?
Um, actually,
ahem, I was thinking of driving up to Los Alamos.
They've got this...
The visitor center has an exhibit on
that's really supposed to be...
You're not gonna paint? No, I'll paint.
It's just that this...
You know, this exhibition
on the Mars-rover photographs are...
I mean, the detail really is just supposed to be amazing.
It's just that I really need you to paint at some point.
The sooner that back bedroom gets finished...
I know.
And I'd do it myself, except you said you don't want me standing on the stepladder.
I will paint. Okay.
What is going on down there? No, it's...
Is he asleep?
No, it's...
No, it's nothing. He's just...
You know. Well, you gotta be careful about the baby and...
Well, don't worry about the baby. This is just for you.
We are just doing you tonight.
So just close your eyes,
relax, and let it...
Close your eyes. Oh, okay.
Okay.
There you go.
That's it.
There you go.
Keep it going.
Keep... Yes! Fifty-six. Oh.
This is so embarrassing. I am fine, honestly.
It's just some bug going around.
First, my wife had it, then my son, and now me.
It's just... It's just like a chest cold.
Could be some low blood sugar as well.
I didn't have the greatest breakfast this morning.
Honestly, I didn't.
Hey, listen, can you do me a favor? Can you just, uh,
drop me off at a corner somewhere?
Uh, no, sorry.
It's just that I don't have the greatest insurance.
Take a couple of deep breaths for me.
Is there anybody you want us to contact for you?
Ha. No. God, no.
Lean forward for me, would you?
Mr. White, are you a smoker?
No, never.
Why do you ask?
Mr. White?
Mr. White?
Yes?
You understood what I've just said to you?
Yes.
Lung cancer. Inoperable.
I'm sorry. I just need to make sure
you fully understand.
Best-case scenario, with chemo,
I'll live maybe another couple years.
It's just
you've got mustard on your...
Right there. You got mustard there.
Right there.
So my records show that I paid it
and I certainly don't feel that we owe any late...
Yeah, all right. Um...
Well, I'll check with the bank and maybe the post office
if they lost it or something.
Yeah, let me look into that. Okay.
Thank you.
Hey.
Um,
did you use the MasterCard last month?
Uh, fifteen eighty-eight at Staples?
Um... Oh, we needed printer paper.
Walt, the MasterCard's the one we don't use.
Okay.
So how was your day?
Oh, you know.
I don't know. It was, um,
fine.
Hey, Walter.
Walter.
Walter. Tomorrow night I'm shorthanded.
I need you outside to do wipe downs.
Come on. What?
I said I need you outside to do some wipe downs.
Are you here to work, or to be staring at the skies?
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, man.
Fuck you, Bogdan.
What?
I said, "fuck you." And your eyebrows.
Wipe down this!
Yo.
Uh, Hank? Hank, it's Walt. Hey.
Oh, listen. I didn't wake you, did I?
Oh, good, good.
Oh, no, no. Nothing's wrong. I just...
I've been, uh, thinking about that offer
of that ride-along.
It's the last house on the right. See it?
Not the two-story one, the one next to it.
Kind of, uh, I don't know what do you call that? Um,
green?
Sage.
"Sage?"
Do you work at the fucking Pottery Barn? Jesus.
Sage. That's the word for it.
My fault the only word your dumb ass knows is "green"?
"Cheese-dick." I know that one. How about that?
Anyway, it's the, um, sage one. See it?
So, what tells you it's a meth lab?
Just our snitch.
Says some dude who goes by "Cap'n Cook"
lives up to his name in there.
Says he always adds a dash of chili powder. Heh-heh.
Ah, you exuberant Mexicans.
Uh-uh. "Cap'n Cook?" That's a white boy's name.
Dopey as hell too.
Yeah? I'll tell you what.
I got you 20 bucks that says he's a beaner.
All right. You're on.
All right. Come on, come on, come on.
All right. School bus is clear. You got the green light.
Copy that.
Watch this. Makes them shit.
Go, go, go, go!
Meth labs are nasty on a good day.
You mix that shit wrong and you got mustard gas.
Phosphine gas.
I think. Yeah, exactly.
One whiff will kill you. That's why the respirators.
House is clear. One suspect in custody.
Copy that. The suspect,
might he be of the Latino persuasion?
Driver's license says "Emilio Koyama."
Asian. Pay up, sucker.
Hey, hey. First name, Emilio.
That's at least half a beaner.
Tell you what, I'll let you off for a 10.
Whoa. Heh, heh.
Cheer up, Gomey.
You people still got J. Lo. Hank.
Do you think I might get to go inside?
See the actual lab?
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah, I'll tell you what, we're gonna go peek our heads in
check it out first.
Stay here a minute. Let's go, Frank.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Pinkman?
Hey. Uh, it's me. I'm alone.
How'd you find me?
You're still in our filing system.
So your... Your aunt owns this place, right?
I own it.
Look, no one's looking for you.
Why are you here?
I was curious.
Honestly, I never expected you to amount to much...
but methamphetamine?
L...
I didn't picture that.
There's a lot of money in it, huh?
I don't know what you're talking about.
No? Not a clue.
Cap'n Cook?
That's not you?
Like I said, no one is looking for you.
Look, I don't know what you think you're doing here,
Mr. White.
I mean, if you're planning on giving me some
bull-winder about getting right with Jesus or turning myself in.
Not really. High school was a long time ago.
You ain't Welcome Back, Kotter, so step off. No speeches.
Short speech.
You lost your partner today. What's-his-name.
Emilio?
Emilio is going to prison.
The DEA took all your money, your lab.
You've got nothing.
Square one.
But you know the business
and I know the chemistry.
I'm thinking
maybe you and I could partner up.
You, uh... You wanna cook crystal meth?
You.
You and, uh... And me.
That's right.
Wow.
Either that,
or I turn you in.
What the hell is this?
Damned if I know.
I described it as mosaic folk art.
And somebody bought it?
Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis.
Fourteen dollars plus shipping. Yes.
At this rate, in 50 or 60 years you'll be rich.
So how goes the novel?
It's not a novel, actually, which I...
You're not writing a novel?
You told me you were. No. Short stories.
I said that if eventually I have enough good ones,
that maybe I'll try
and publish another collection.
Those really didn't sell.
I just thought a novel would be easier to sell.
Yeah, well, maybe so.
Ever want me to read anything, I could critique it for you.
Oh.
No.
I mean, I'm just not at that stage where I...
No.
Open offer.
So, what's up with Walt lately?
What do you mean? He's fine.
He just seems,
I don't know. Quieter than usual.
Well, turning 50 is a big deal.
I mean, I'm sure as hell not looking forward to 40.
You're gonna be a complete basket-case.
So it's a mid-life crisis.
No. He's just quiet.
How's the sex?
Marie, Jesus.
I guess that answers that.
You just gonna sit there?
Look at this. Look at this.
Kjeldahl-style recovery flask, 800 milliliters. Very rare.
You got your usual paraphernalia, Griffin beakers,
there's your Erlenmeyer flask. Butthe piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance,
a round bottom boiling flask, 5000 milliliters. Huh?
I cook in one of those. A big one.
One of these?
No, this is a volumetric flask.
You wouldn't cook in one of these.
Uh, yeah. I do.
Uh, no, you don't.
A volumetric flask is for general mixing and titration.
You wouldn't apply heat to a volumetric flask.
That's what a boiling flask is for.
Did you learn nothing from my chemistry class?
No. You flunked me, remember?
No wonder. Prick.
And let me tell you something else. This ain't chemistry.
Okay, this is art. Oh, ha.
Cooking is art,
and shit I cook is the bomb, so don't be telling me.
Shit you cook is shit. The shit.
I saw your setup. Ridiculous.
You and I will not make garbage.
We will produce a chemically pure and stable product
that performs as advertised. No adulterants.
No baby formula. No chili powder.
No, no. Chili P's my signature.
Not anymore.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.
What the hell is this?
Lab safety equipment.
We're also gonna have an emergency eye wash station.
These chemicals and their fumes are toxic.
In case you didn't know that.
Well, you can dress up like a faggot if you want. Not me.
Listen, this stuff
doesn't stay more than a day.
What? I thought we were gonna cook here.
No, we're not gonna cook here.
Okay, this is my house. I don't shit where I eat.
Well, then where are we gonna work?
You tell me. This is your deal, man.
You wanna smoke it up, smoke it up at your house.
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
Well,
what if we rented one of those self-storage places?
You know, those little orange garages? Worked out of there?
No, they're onto that. They've got dogs that sniff around.
RV, that's what you want.
What, like a Winnebago?
Yeah.
I know a dude who wants to sell his.
He just goes camping with it.
But a mobile meth lab? That'd be the bomb.
I mean, you can drive way out in the boonies.
Be all evasive.
Dude, this isn't even seven grand, all right?
My guy wants 85.
This is all the money I have in the world.
You're a drug dealer. Negotiate.
You are not how I remember you from class.
I mean, like, not at all.
Yeah, well, I gotta go.
Wait. Wait. Hold up.
Tell me why you're doing this. Seriously.
Why do you do it?
Money, mainly.
There you go.
Nah, come on, man.
Some straight like you, giant stick up his ass
all a sudden at age, what, 60, he's just gonna break bad?
I'm 50. It's weird, is all.
Okay, it doesn't compute. Listen,
if you've gone crazy or something,
I mean, if y... If you've gone crazy, or depressed.
I'm... I'm just saying.
T... That's something I need to know about.
Okay, I mean, that affects me.
I am awake.
What?
Buy the RV.
We start tomorrow.
How's it coming in there?
Fine.
Do you want me or your dad?
Dad.
So how are those feeling in the waist? Are they too tight?
You don't want to get them if they're too tight.
They're... They're pretty shrunk.
Are you sure you don't want to get the...? Like a different kind?
Like, you know, the skinny jeans,
because those are in style. The skaters wear them.
Do I look like a skater?
All right.
Mom, get them, my big boy pants.
Mommy, could you zip up my big boy pants?
Don't.
What?
Don't.
Walt.
Where...? I have no idea.
No, you know what? Don't even look at them.
They're obviously very stupid. Yep.
Yeah.
I think that, um... I think those jeans look really good on you.
I think you should get them if you like them, okay?
You know what? Why don't you hang out here for a second. I'll be right back.
Fine.
Hey, Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf
in my brand new big boy pants.
What are you doing?
What's wrong, chief? Having a little trouble walking?
Get off me! Get off me!
I'll mess you up, man.
You'll have one shot. You'd better make it good.
What, are you waiting for your girlfriends? You better go.
You'd better go. Take it. Take your shot. Take it!
Come on. Come on.
Come on, let's get out of here. Let's go.
Psycho.
Yeah, nothing but cows.
Got some big cow house way out that way, like two miles,
but I don't see nobody.
"Cow house"?
Yeah. Where they live.
The cows.
Whatever, man. Shit, yeah. Let's cook here.
Cow house.
God help me.
Uh, what are you doing?
These are my good clothes.
You can't go home smelling like a meth lab.
Uh, yeah, you can. I do.
Those?
Wow. Those, uh... You're keeping those on, right?
Come on. Daylight's burning.
Oh, my God.
Wow, this is... This is a good look for you.
I mean, you're maybe only the world's second-biggest homo.
Would you shut up and help me?
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Work it. Baby, work it.
Turn that off.
This is glass-grade.
You got...
Jesus, you got crystals in here two inches, three inches long.
This is pure glass.
You're a goddamn artist.
This... This is art, Mr. White.
Well, actually, it's just basic chemistry,
but thank you, Jesse. I'm glad it's acceptable.
Acceptable? You're the goddamn Iron Chef.
Every jibhead from here to Timbuktu's gonna want a taste.
Man, I... I gotta try this.
No. No.
No. We only sell it. We don't use it.
Okay, since when?
Listen, you've been watching way too much Miami Vice.
That ain't happening.
So, what now?
How do we proceed?
We cook more tomorrow.
Meantime,
I know just the guy to talk to.
Get him. Come on.
Hey, yo. Kraze, how you doing, my man?
Hey, you got a new dog. Right on, man.
What's his name?
Yeah, I had a dog like that once,
except maybe like twice as big.
Super-purebred.
Now, me personally,
I would train him to go straight for the nutsack.
Just shut your mouth and show me your money.
I ain't buying, ese.
I'm selling.
Tell me that ain't the finest scante you ever laid eyes on.
Go ahead. Try it.
Hey, poochie. How you doing?
Jesus Christ.
Yeah. Booya! See, what'd I say?
It's all right. It's all right?
It's all right? Yeah, it's all right.
So what? You're back in business?
Hell, yeah, I'm back.
With a vengeance. Vato loco gotta make a living.
You know, with your cousin gone away and all...
And listen, homes, about that...
Really broke me up about Emilio.
That dude is like my brother.
You okay? You talk to him?
Yeah, I talk to him.
Said when the feds came,
you were out sticking it in some neighbor lady.
Hey, you know, I got lucky twice.
I don't know, man.
Emilio...
he thinks maybe you dimed on him.
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. That is bullshit.
That is bullshit, Krazy-8.
I should kick his punk ass for even thinking that.
You know what? Next time you talk to Emilio,
you tell him for me, all right?
Why don't you tell him yourself? Made bail this morning.
Go ahead, pendejo.
Kick my ass. Hey, listen...
Where did you get this?
Hm?
Because I know your little punk ass didn't cook it.
Damn, man. What are you, some kind of nudist?
Yeah, that's some stone-fine tick-tick you been cooking there, ese.
How about you come work for me?
I'd be willing to sell it to you
if... If the price is right.
Out here all by yourself, huh?
Hey, I know you. He was there when I got busted.
He's with the DEA. No.
You rata snitch motherfucker.
Run, Mr. White! Run!
Ah.
I say we cap them both.
You really cook up that batch?
Yeah.
You an artist.
It's a damn shame. Wait.
Wait a minute.
Listen to me. I'll teach you my recipe, huh?
What do you say? You wanna cook like me?
You let us both live,
and I will teach you, huh?
Put the cigarette out.
Please...
Move it, homes. You got all day?
Okay.
Shit.
Shit!
What happened?
Hey, what'd you do to them?
Red phosphorus in the presence of moisture
and accelerated by heat
yields phosphorus hydride.
Phosphine gas.
One good whiff and poof.
We gotta...
We gotta clean this up.
Where were you?
Walt...
I don't know what's been going on with you lately
but... Nothing, honey. I'm fine.
Whatever it is, I'll tell you this.
I do not like it when you don't talk to me.
The worst thing you can do is shut me out.
Walt...
Oh, Walt, is that you?
ï»¿1
Are you okay?
You are a lifesaver.
Yeah, man.
Yeah, we can't thank you enough.
No, hey, mad... Mad props.
I could have sworn the guy said south.
But then all of a sudden we're off the main road
then I'm trying to read the map while I'm driving,
which is a bonehead maneuver.
And then all of a sudden, bam, we're... We're in that ditch.
Yeah, bam. I'm like, "What the hell?" You know?
Yes. Oh, yes, and my coffee mug. Of coffee? My mug of coffee.
It spills all over my pants, I mean... Just a nightmare.
There's your Sony GPS, I mean, for real.
Let's just...
Like I said, we couldn't be more grateful.
Can't we just dump them here?
What, and somebody finds them?
Then what?
People have seen us.
Hey, you're... You're gonna flood it, man.
I'm not gonna flood it. She's not going to flood, all right?
We're just gonna stay positive, right?
We're gonna clean up this mess. And you, start.
Goddamn it. See, you flooded it.
All right.
All right. You know what? The RV is going to start now.
The RV is going to start right now.
It's gonna start and we're gonna drive it over to your house.
My house? Yes. Your house.
We're gonna drive it over there and park it overnight. And then tomorrow...
Uh-uh, man, not my house.
Shut up! Shut up!
After we finish cleaning up this mess,
we will go our separate ways.
Our paths will never cross.
And we will tell this to no one.
Understood?
Oh, what, I can talk now?
Fine. That goes double for me.
Okay. Okay.
Be good to me.
Yes!
Yes. Okay. Okay.
Thank you.
Oh, shit.
Walt?
You coming out?
Mm-hm.
Yeah, absolutely.
We got looky-loos in both directions, Dan.
Better plan on being late if you're going in that direction.
This is Lisa in the Skycopter,
we'll have more Albuquerque traffic on the hour.
Hey, um, you wanna hear something funny?
We had a... A faculty meeting last Thursday
and the topic was senior-class photos
and how we had instituted a new rule last year
that seniors are allowed to have photos taken
by a photographer of their choice.
You know, not necessarily the photographer
that the school hires, right? So...
Um, eh,
so anyway, uh, some of the senior girls
were going to that, um, Glamour Shots place
to have their photos taken.
And now they're bringing us all these photos,
and Joan Everman... You know Joan.
Suddenly has to go through all these photos
and turn them down because they show cleavage.
Did you get enough pancakes, sweetie?
Yeah. L... I'm good.
Okay.
You know, even the small-busted girls
have cleavage.
Apparently there's some new type
of brassiere or something.
The Wonderbra.
It's the Wonderbra. Yeah?
Okay.
Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.
We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave us a message.
Hello, Mr. White.
This is AT&T calling.
Are you happy with your current long-distance service?
Because if you're not, I would definitely really, really love
to talk to you as soon as possible about...
Hello? Hello? Hello, this is Walter White speaking.
You said he was practically dead, okay?
You said he would die any minute.
Listen, uh, I am having breakfast
with my family right now
and I... I really don't appreciate these sales calls.
Well, too bad, man, because guess what.
He's still not dead.
I went and put my ear to the RV. I can hear him, like,
rolling around in there, all right?
I... I... I think he's awake, man.
I think he's trying to get loose.
Where the hell are you? I'm freaking out over here.
Calm down, damn it.
Are you gonna help me clean this up?
Huh? We got loose ends here.
Calm down.
I will be there after school.
Huh, after school. Are you shitting me?
Ditch it, man. Call in sick.
Listen, uh, that is just not gonna work for me.
I'm... I'm not interested in that at all.
And, uh, I would appreciate it if you don't call here anymore.
Damn. They're so annoying, those people.
You have a good day, sweetie.
Okay, Mom. You too.
Okay. Bye, honey.
Drive safe. Okay.
Yo, yo, yo,
1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3 to the 6 to the 9,
representing the ABQ.
What up, beyotch? Leave it at the tone.
So the term "chiral"
derives from the Greek word "hand."
Now, the concept here being that
just as your left hand and your right hand
are mirror images of one another, right,
identical and yet opposite,
well, so, too, organic compounds can exist
as mirror-image forms of one another
all the way down at the molecular level.
But although they may look the same,
they don't always behave the same.
For instance...
Uh, I'm sorry. Uh, for instance, uh...
Thalidomide.
The... The right-handed isomer of the drug thalidomide
is a perfectly fine, good medicine
to give to a pregnant woman to prevent morning sickness.
But make the mistake of giving that same pregnant woman
the left-handed isomer of the drug thalidomide
and her child will be born with horrible birth defects.
Which is precisely what happened in the 1950s.
So chiral, chirality,
mirrored images, right?
Active, inactive, good, bad.
Uh, so.
Yes, Ben.
Is this gonna be on the murder?
What?
Is this gonna be on the midterm?
Uh, chirality on the midterm?
No, no. Well, maybe. Maybe. Yes, you know...
But prepare for it to be on the midterm.
Can't hurt to know it, right? So...
Knowledge is power.
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. No.
Not good. Not good, not good.
What the...?
Hey. Hey. Hey, you.
Hey, listen, you.
No, no, no, no!
Oh, God.
Okay.
MILFs?
The hell is a MILF?
Now what?
Lock the other one out in the RV.
He's, uh:
You're sure? Yes.
You're positive? Hey, you know what?
Feel free to go check it yourself.
Hey, yeah, Good idea. Maybe I should do that
before he, too, wanders off down the damn street.
Okay, you know what? I am sick...
Just... All right. All right!
Just...
The one downstairs, tell me about him.
Oh, come on. Anything. Something.
Start with his name, at least.
Krazy-8.
Krazy-8. What the hell does that even mean?
I don't know, man, okay?
It means, like... Like, Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.
So you work with him regularly.
No, not him so much.
His cousin, mainly. Who's his cousin?
The... The guy out in the RV.
All right, all right, all right.
Krazy-8's one level higher.
One level higher.
Yeah, you know. Not, like, street level. Higher.
You know how there's, like, a Starbucks on every corner?
Krazy-8 is like the dude that sells Starbucks' beans.
Okay, so he's a distributor.
Okay, so is he? I mean, is?
In other words, what is his reputation for violence?
Well, um, he did try
to kill us both yesterday, so there's that.
Look, what I'm trying to say
is that he's a distributor, right?
He's a... He's a businessman. He's a man of business.
It would therefore seem to follow that he is
capable of acting out of mutual self-interest, yes?
What?
Do you think he is capable of listening to reason?
I mean, what...? What kind of reason? You mean, like,
"Dear Krazy-8, hey, listen, if I let you go,
you promise not to come back and waste my entire family?
No Colombian neckties?" You mean that kind of reason?
No, man, I can't say as I have high fucking hopes
where that's concerned.
What was that?
What was what? Shh!
Come! What?
We didn't tie him up.
Why the hell didn't we tie him up?
Oh, God.
Because he was out cold.
Yeah, but what... What if he's faking it?
You know, like, if it was me,
I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo.
And then, when the coast is clear,
I'd be up looking for weapons and shit.
Ready to pounce.
Shh, shh, shh.
No, see. Now, if it was me
and I couldn't find a decent enough weapon,
I would just lie back down and bide my time.
So now what do we do?
You keep asking me that
like you think I have some answer.
Well, you gotta do something.
No, we.
We have got to do something, and I am open to suggestions.
Man, uh, okay, this whole thing was your deal.
Don't you dare put that on me.
You brought those guys out there.
This is your responsibility.
Oh, like I came to you, begging to cook meth.
"Oh, hey, nerdiest old dude I know,
you wanna come cook crystal?" Please.
I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny
but her wheelchair wouldn't fit in the RV.
What about the, uh... The... The... The phosphate gas?
The phosphine gas. What about it?
Well, do... I mean, do you think it still might kill him?
You know, with, like, a delayed reaction or something?
I... I don't know.
You're supposed to be a scientist.
Look, this isn't even the issue
that demands immediate attention.
We have got a body in that RV.
And it's getting warmer outside.
Understand?
And we have got to do something about that soon.
And in a way that no one will ever find it.
Now, that... That last part is very, very important.
Therefore, it seems to me
that our best course of action
would be chemical disincorporation.
Dissolving in strong acid.
Oh, man, that's messed up.
I mean, ahem, you're not serious.
You serious?
Well, who's gonna do that?
And don't look at me.
I guess we'll both do it together.
No, Mr. White, okay, I'm not... I'm not good with dead bodies.
Look, we are in this fifty-fifty. Okay?
I guess the only other fair way to go about this would be
that one of us deals with the body situation
while the other one of us deals with the Krazy-8 situation.
In a scenario like this, I don't suppose it is bad form
to just flip a coin.
Heads or tails?
No, I'll... I'll do the body in the acid, okay?
Heads or tails?
Heads. Heads.
Best two out of three?
Yo, yo, yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3
to the 6 to the 9, representing the ABQ.
What up, beyotch? Leave it at the tone.
Hey, Mr. White, it's me. Pick up.
I got a container question.
Hello, Mr. White. Pick up the phone, man.
Yes. Yo, what kind of plastic, man?
Polyethylene.
Well, how the hell am I supposed to know that?
Because I told you.
Look, just...
Look at the bottom for a triangle
stamped LDPE.
It should be molded right into the plastic.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, LDPE. Right on, got it.
I don't know, man. This feels kind of flimsy.
Any decent acid's gonna eat right through this.
Not hydrofluoric. Why not?
Look, you skipped, clowned around
or otherwise jerked off through every lecture I ever gave.
As far as I'm concerned, your chemistry education is over.
Oh, okay, be a dick about it. Jesus.
So, hey, have you, um?
Have you done the...? The thing?
Yeah, I'm...
I'm working up to it.
You know what?
I bet he doesn't even wake up.
You know, not even if you took him to the hospital right now.
Now, if it was me,
I would just try and think of it like I was...
I was doing him a favor.
I need a check approval on checkstand eight.
Approval on checkstand eight, please. Thank you.
Yeah.
Who's there?
What, you fucking break in? Show me who's there.
Yeah. I see you.
What you gonna do?
Hey.
Hey...!
Hey!
I need water.
Hey, hello.
Bring me some water, would you?
Please.
You don't like the crust?
Where's my cousin Emilio?
He dead?
Oh, I'm a coward.
Hey, Mr. White.
Hey, Mr. White?
Oh, fuck.
Are you smoking weed? Oh, my God.
Wait a minute, is that...? Is that my weed?
What the hell, man?
Make yourself at home, why don't you?
So, what'd you end up buying?
Nothing.
No store in town sells a plastic bin big enough for a body.
I don't suppose you could buy two bins?
And, uh, just:
Legs in one, torso in the other?
Oh, God.
I don't suppose you could kiss my ass?
So, uh,
how'd it...? How'd it go?
You didn't do it?
Not... Not yet.
Oh, God.
Oh, damn. I gotta go. Hey, hey.
What? No, no, no. Come back here.
Sorry. I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.
Tomorrow?
I've got a doctor's appointment. I gotta go.
Look, stay away from him. He's awake.
Hey, man, we flipped a coin.
We flipped a coin!
We're... We're good?
We're very good. We're excellent, I'd say.
Oh.
Oh, would you look at that face?
Smile, peanut.
So who's up for knowing?
Oh... Uh...
It's... It's... Uh...
Yeah.
Girl.
Girl?
You sure?
Pretty sure.
Wow.
Oh, God. Can I tell you, that's exactly what I was hoping.
Yeah? Yeah.
You remember you said that when she's 16 and starts dating.
Looking fabulous.
Let me see if they're done with the blood sugar,
then we'll get you out of here. I'll be right back.
Who's Jesse Pinkman?
Jesse?
Jesse Pinkman.
He... He called just this morning.
Walt, please don't deny it.
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It... It says on his MyShout page he attended Wynne.
What, was he one of your students?
Yeah.
He was nobody.
Who...? Who is he to you? Why...? Why is he calling?
What is this big secret
you seem to be discussing with some druggie burnout?
You don't come home last night until 2 in the morning.
You don't tell me where you've been.
You spent the entire night in the bathroom, Walt.
Tell me what's going on with you.
Don't you think you owe me that?
Who is this Jesse Pinkman to you?
He sells me pot.
He sells you pot?
Marijuana, yeah.
Not a lot. I mean, I don't know.
I kind of like it.
Are you out of your mind?
What...? What are you, like, 16 years old?
Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.
What...? What is wrong with you?
Look, Skyler,
I just haven't quite been myself lately.
Yeah. No shit. Thanks for noticing.
I haven't been myself lately,
but I love you.
Nothing about that has changed.
Nothing ever will.
So right now, what I need
is for you to climb down out of my ass.
Can you do that?
Will you do that for me, honey?
Will you please, just once,
get off my ass?
You know.
I'd appreciate it. I really would.
Stop.
Stop in... In 15 minutes.
Your face is too sharp.
Powder. Powder!
Take a powder, go on.
Nice. Beautiful talcum powder.
Lucky you, number eight.
Just meat, it's all just... Just a bunch of meat.
Oh, Jesus.
You're cool, you're cool.
You're all good, you're all... You're all good. You know it.
It's fine. It's just a bunch of meat.
Come on. You're good.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. You. Yes, you.
May I talk to you?
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.
This is private property.
Just a minute. I... I wanna talk to you.
No, no, not interested. Come on.
Hey, don't touch me.
Do not touch me.
All right, all right, look, not touching, okay? Not touching here.
Look, lady, whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, yo.
Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.
My husband is Walter White, yo.
Uh-huh.
He told me everything.
Seriously?
That's right.
And just so you know,
my brother-in-law is a DEA agent
and I will not hesitate to call him.
Not if I have to. Understood?
This is your one and only warning.
Do not sell marijuana to my husband.
Okay. I mean it.
Don't call our house again.
You stay away from him, or you will be one sorry individual.
You get me?
L... I, uh, think so, yeah.
Um, no more marijuana. Mm-hm.
I can... I can dig it.
You can dig it. Wonderful.
Not that it's any of my business,
but you might wanna consider a different line of work.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's go to your house, you know.
Makes perfect sense.
Let's, uh...
Let's completely screw up your house
so you never wanna spend another night in it.
Sure. You know, why not?
Yeah, and how's about I send over my psycho-bitch wife
to, uh, you know, break your balls and threaten you?
God, that would be hilarious, you know.
And then, you know, the killer in the basement,
the one who's completely my responsibility,
hell, let's just let him live down there.
Just, I don't know, make sure to feed him, like,
three times a day.
Sure, why not? It's been really amazing.
Thank you so much for the opportunity.
I always dreamt about, I don't know, melting bodies.
You got a brother in the goddamn DEA?
What?
You said you were just doing some ride-along.
Yes or no, do you have a brother in the DEA?
He's a brother-in-law.
Oh, well, there's a load off my mind.
Where did you hear that?
Your freaking wife told me
when she was here all up in my shit.
Yeah, that's right.
She almost caught me moving Emilio.
Good job on wearing the pants in the family.
And why'd you go and tell her I was selling you weed?
Because somehow it seemed preferable
to admitting that I cook crystal meth and killed a man.
Is that what I think it is?
Yeah. Yeah, it is. I smoked a bowl.
So what? My house, my rules.
Hey, no, no. Hey, don't give me that, okay?
I held up my end.
I already took care of Emilio.
You're still diddling around trying to get your nut up.
Yeah, well, boo-hoo.
I have the truly awful job here.
Oh, you wanna... You wanna talk awful? You wanna go there?
Try dragging 200 pounds of stink up a flight of stairs.
I barely got him in the bathtub.
Bathtub, what? What do you mean, bathtub?
You know, and that's another thing.
Why you got me running around town
trying to find some stupid piece of plastic
when I have a perfectly good tub I can use?
Oh, God.
Hey. Hey.
I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes.
That stupid plastic container I asked you to buy.
You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic.
It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic.
So there's that.
Here I go.
ï»¿1
Let's break it down.
Hydrogen. What does that give us?
By mole, we're looking at 63 percent.
Sixty-three? Wow. Mm-hm.
That is a big bite.
My next step's gotta be oxygen. Oxygen, 26 percent.
Twenty-six. There you have your water.
Carbon, 9 percent. Carbon, 9.
For a total of 98 percent. Right.
Nitrogen, 1.25 percent.
One-point-two-five.
That brings you to 99 and a quarter.
Which only leaves you with the trace elements
down where the magic happens.
Oh, wait a minute. What about calcium? Calcium's not a trace.
Got a whole skeleton to account for.
You would think, right?
Right.
Calcium. Calcium's only 0.25 percent.
What? That low? Uh-huh. Mm-hm.
Seriously?
Damn, I never would've thought that.
Okay, so where does iron fit in? Iron.
Wow, okay,
0.00004 percent.
What? You can't have hemoglobin without iron.
Apparently, it don't take much. No doubt. Go figure.
Ah, sodium.
Sodium, 0.04.
Phosphorus, 0.19.
Point-one-nine.
There we go.
So the whole thing
adds up to...
99.888042 percent.
We are 0.111958 percent
shy.
Supposedly that's everything. Yeah?
Mm-hm.
I don't know, it just...
It just...
It seems like something's missing, doesn't it?
There's got to be more to a human being than that.
I hate these shoes.
Shoes make me look like I should be changing bedpans,
like I should be squeaking around
bringing soup to some disgusting old person,
then take the bus home to my 16 cats.
Then why are you wearing them?
I like the support. My arches happen to be extremely arch-y.
Yo, what's up?
Hey, can you call me, like, in two minutes?
Thanks, bye.
I gotta go take this.
Ooh. Female?
Louis.
Not like it's any of your business, though.
Just be quick about it. No.
Oh, and, um, please don't say, "Yo."
You can't know how much I hate that.
You missed a spot, right there.
Should you be up on that ladder?
You're more than welcome to take over for me up here.
I don't see why you don't get Walt to do it.
Yeah, there's an idea.
So um, I'm, uh, I'm working on this new short story
and there's this stoner character in it
and I'm trying to... um...
Well, you know, actually, let me back up.
Um, you, uh,
you smoked your fair share
of pot in college, didn't you?
I mean, you at least tried it.
Come on.
I perhaps tried it. Why?
Do you remember it having an effect on your mood?
Like, changing it in any major way?
It made me more serious.
Really?
Because I mostly remember
it made me lightheaded, that's about it.
I was just wondering if...
If it maybe could, um...
Um, you know,
it's just a character thing I'm stuck on. Never mind.
Walter, Jr.'s on pot? What? No.
No. No.
What would make you even...? Where's he getting it from?
Marie. Seriously. Is it this Louis person?
What are you gonna do about this?
Marie, you need to look me in the eye.
I am strictly asking
about a story that I'm writing, that's all.
Right hand to God, Walter Jr. Is not on pot,
certainly not as far as I know.
Not as far as you know?
Marie.
Hey, look at me.
Hey, turn around and look at me.
This... This here.
I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.
This is degrading.
I'm sorry.
You hope I'll make it easy and just drop dead, don't you?
But I won't.
So either kill me, or let me go.
You don't have it in you, Walter.
How do you know my name?
Jesse.
He told Emilio and me.
I came by to sell your meth.
So, what, did you threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him? Not even close.
What else did he tell you?
Pretty much everything he could think of.
You were his high-school teacher.
One time you taught about carbon dioxide
by making grape soda in class.
You have a son who's retarded,
or in a wheelchair or something.
It shouldn't come across as some news flash.
That partner of yours,
he's got a big mouth.
Walter,
I don't know what you think you're doing here,
but trust me,
this line of work doesn't suit you.
So I should just let you go, then?
Just unlock you
and adiÃ³s, huh?
I don't see what real choice you have.
If it's between that and cold-blooded murder.
Besides...
your real problem's sitting upstairs.
Occupied.
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off in here.
Just give me some privacy, would you?
Okay. What the hell, man?
What are you doing, man?
You asshole. What...? You told him my name.
Says who, him? My name, where I work.
You told him about my son. Hey, don't touch me.
Damn junkie. No, give me that. That's mine.
This is going down the toilet. Watch it go.
No, that's worth 40 grand, you stupid shit.
It's worth nothing when you smoke it all.
Get off the toilet.
Get off the toilet! No.
Get off the toilet.
Stop it.
No. No way.
No.
No, no, no.
Jesse, where the hell do you think you're going?
Back off, man. Jesus.
We've got work to do. No, no.
You... You got work to do. I did my part.
You mean that obscenity I spent the last two hours cleaning up?
That is your contribution? Kiss my pink ass, man.
I didn't ask for any of this.
How am I supposed to live here now, huh?
My whole house smells like toe cheese and dry cleaning.
Because you didn't follow my instructions.
Oh, well, heil Hitler, bitch.
And let me tell you something else.
We flipped a coin, okay?
You and me. You and me.
Coin flip is sacred.
Your job is waiting for you in that basement,
as per the coin.
Fucking do it, already.
That's what she said. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, I think we have some of those.
Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
Hello? Seven and a half, maybe.
I don't know. Excuse me.
Do you have these in black?
Uh-uh.
Anyways, so like I was saying,
I went to the party the other night. Yeah, Tony was there.
Whatever.
Hey, where have you been? I called you two hours ago.
Sorry, baby, I'm, uh, kind of busy here. What's up?
Well, kind of a lot, actually,
and it's a delicate subject.
So I need you to focus, and...
Hey, sit down! Sit down!
Damn it, Hank.
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle of something here.
Get...
Sit down! Sit your ass down, comprende? You too, sit down!
Shit.
I'm back, babe. What's up?
Walter Jr. Yeah, what about him?
Marijuana. He's smoking it. Bullshit.
Excuse me, his own mother seems to think so.
Skyler told you that? She inferred it.
She inferred it, huh?
She strongly inferred it.
Like, "Doctor, my friend
suffers from erectile dysfunction."
Please, come on. All right.
I want you to talk to him. Walt should talk to him.
Hell, Skyler, better yet. She'll kick his butt up and down the block.
I think it ought to be you.
You know, tell him some horror stories.
Maybe show him some autopsy pictures.
An autopsy of a pot overdose? Come on.
I don't know, baby, it's just that, you know,
I figure his dad should be the one doing this thing, don't you think?
Hank, he respects you.
Yeah, all right. Well, listen, I mean,
I'll swing by their place after work.
Good. Scare him straight. Yeah, yeah.
Hey, where's my sugar?
Hm. Muah.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies before you try those on.
I'm extremely clean.
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.
Hey, sorry about that. Yeah, I'll check.
You know, I hid a pair for you last week, gray ones.
My manager found them and we put them back on the floor.
I know.
Hey.
I'm going.
What do you think?
About what?
This look like a nice place?
No, not really.
Think you'd like to live here?
No.
Sure about that? Yeah, pretty sure.
I thought we were going to Cold Stone Creamery.
Yeah, yeah, well, we took a little detour.
Figure we'll come over here and check out how the other half lives.
This here is what we call the Crystal Palace.
You know who lives in the palace? Meth-heads.
Nasty, skeevy meth-heads
who'd sell their grandma's coochie for a hit.
Oh, you think that's funny? That's funny, huh? Yeah.
Let me tell you something. Every one of these
miserable wastes of skin got started how?
Hm?
How do you think they started? I don't know.
What do you think it was they were all doing before they graduated
to shooting meth in their dicks?
A gateway drug.
That's what we call it.
Dollars to doughnuts, and I shit you not,
that gateway drug was marijuana, every time.
You understand? Um, yeah.
So why are you telling me this?
Because I love you, you little bastard.
And, hey, I was young once, you know.
The world's a messed-up place, you know.
You know, just this, uh, one time, you know...
Hey! Hey! Hey, you!
Yeah, you, princess. Get over here.
Hey, don't make me get out of the car.
Check this out.
See what I'm talking about.
Hey, I ain't holding, okay? Did I say you could open your mouth?
And hands off the car.
Other side. Go around the other side, talk to my friend here.
What's your name, sweetheart?
Wendy.
Wendy, huh?
How much you charge for a windy, Wendy?
I ain't doing him, he's a kid. Jesus, was that my question?
Don't think so hard, it's gonna hurt your brain.
Are you on the pipe or on the needle?
Nothing. Neither.
Yeah, yeah. Show us your teeth, huh?
Come on, Wendy, let's see those pearly whites.
Oh, God. See that? Pipe, definitely.
Bigtime, bigtime on the pipe.
You got something you wanna ask Wendy?
Um, no, not really.
You ever smoke anything else, Wendy?
Sausages don't count.
Ahem. Seriously, tell my friend here how you got started.
Probably used to be, what, like a Girl Scout
or probably sang in the church choir?
What are you, like, handicapped?
He broke his leg playing football.
He's a QB. Got an arm like a howitzer.
So tell me, Wendy, you smoke pot?
Why, you got some?
All right, hoof it, get lost. Get out of here.
Hey, fair warning, next time I'm gonna bust you.
So, what do you think?
Cool.
Shut the door. Shut the door.
Lock it. Lock it, lock it.
Who the hell was that?
Cop and some football player messing with me.
They ask about me, huh?
No, I think they just wanted pot.
Right there.
Shit, left my root beer.
Hello? Hey, sweetie, it's me.
Listen, I'm so sorry.
The time, it just, ha...
It just... It completely got away from me.
I'm just, ha... uh...
My fault, my fault. Bogdan just kept me here late,
you know, doing some inventory,
and I, um, I... I should've just...
You know, you're right.
L-I gotta learn to say, you know, "No."
But, um...
Sky? You there?
You're at the car wash?
Yeah.
I seriously doubt that,
since you quit two weeks ago.
I called Bogdan, looking for you.
Quite an earful he gave me.
Listen...
Listen, I'll come home and we'll talk about it.
I don't think so, Walt. Honey...
Wherever you are,
why don't you just stay there tonight?
Skyler? Skyler?
Skyler?
Walter?
Hello?
Hey, I'm kind of hungry down here.
Oh.
Come on.
Damn.
I didn't think you were coming back.
How long was I out?
Ten, 15 minutes?
I've never seen someone knock themselves out just by coughing.
You breathe in the same shit you used on me?
I've got lung cancer.
I'll go make you another sandwich.
It's safe.
There's no poison.
Because that would be the way to do it,
if you're gonna do it.
I suppose it would.
I mean,
you being a chemist and all.
So that name...
Krazy-8.
Do I really have to call you that?
I mean, no offense,
but don't you have a real name?
Domingo.
That's "Sunday," right?
I'd rather call you that, if you don't mind.
Whatever.
I can't say I ever liked it much.
So, Domingo,
you from around town here or someplace else?
Hey, Walter? You getting to know me
is not gonna make it easier for you to kill me.
Not that I mind, you understand?
You know, you keep telling me that I don't have it in me.
Well, maybe.
But maybe not.
I sure as hell am looking for any reason not to.
I mean, any good reason at all.
Sell me.
Tell me what it is.
I guess I'd start off by promising that if you let me go
I won't come after you, that you'd be safe.
I guess I'd say what happened between us
never happened.
And what's best for both parties is we forget all about it.
But you know that anybody in my situation
would make promises like that.
And, in my case, they happen to be true.
You'll never know for sure.
So, what else can I tell you?
I don't know.
But you've gotta convince me.
And you're going nowhere until you do.
Hey, yeah. Yeah.
I'm from here in town, man.
ABQ, born and bred.
Never left.
Studied Business Administration over at UNM,
got my degree.
Really?
Does that, uh, come in handy in the drug trade?
It doesn't hurt.
I was gonna study music originally.
Maybe even try out for Oberlin and Berklee.
My pops talked me out of it.
Said there was no money in it
unless I wind up some bullshit rock star,
and I didn't have a snowball chance of that.
What does your dad do?
He owns Tampico Furniture
over on Menaul.
Wait a minute, I know that place.
Wait a minute. That's...
That's that... That, uh...
They used to have those... Those late-night...
The stupid commercials. That they had, yeah.
Yeah, that's him. Been doing them for over 30 years.
Wait a minute. How did it go? It was, uh...
Wait, wait, wait. It was...
Don't let shopping Strain your brain-o
Just sing this short refrain-o
Our furniture is bueno Our furniture is bueno
Tampico is the name-o Tampico is the name-o
Pretty moronic. But what can you do?
Well, it did tend to stick in your head.
Did you write that? Being the musician in the family.
Hell, no, man. It was my crazy uncle Alex.
He sings it at bars, trying to pick up on women.
His mind, it's like saying,
"Hey, I wrote 'Stairway to Heaven."'
Yeah, but at Tampico Furniture, I...
I think when my son was born
that we bought his bassinet there.
Uh-uh. We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a specialty item.
We did use to sell cribs.
A crib, then, okay. A crib.
Yeah. No, I remember that.
In fact, I remember recognizing your dad
from those commercials.
Although he wasn't anywhere near as friendly in real life.
Yeah. No shit.
Did he, uh, try selling you that extended warranty?
Yeah, he probably did.
And I was probably dumb enough to buy it.
Yeah, that was his big thing.
You ask him for a glass of water,
he'd tell you you need an extended warranty on the ice.
Did you work there too? Only my whole life.
Up until the day I said, "Fuck you," and quit.
So, uh...
16 years ago, how old would you have been?
If it was after school, trust me, I was there.
Might have even helped ring you up.
You and your extended warranty on the crib.
Small world.
It is.
The paths we take, huh?
Jesse know you've got cancer?
No one but you.
Not your family?
No.
Why not?
Not a conversation that I'm even remotely ready to have.
That's why you're cooking meth?
You wanna leave money for your family.
Hell, I mean,
I'll write you a check right now if you let me go.
Like I said, Walter,
this line of work doesn't suit you.
Get out before it's too late.
I don't know what to do.
Yeah.
You do.
I'll get the key.
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No. No. No, don't do this.
Don't do this. Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
You're doing the right thing, Walter.
Yeah?
Do you wanna?
So you're not angry?
What do you mean?
Angry at you?
No.
Live and let live, man.
That's very understanding.
Whatever, man.
I just wanna go home.
Yeah.
Me too.
Unlock me, Walter.
The moment I do...
are you gonna stick me with that broken piece of plate?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Hello?
Anybody down here?
Everybody,
I need you all to take your seats.
Settle down, please. Thank you.
I understand that Mr. White is feeling
a little under the weather this morning.
So you folks
are going to have to be making do with me today.
And we are going to be watching a very interesting video
on carbon
Very important stuff.
So, what do you think?
Ah, it's a cook site. Gotta be.
Nobody came way the hell out here just to buy.
Fire there could have started by accident.
I don't think that was meant to destroy evidence.
Got a couple of Dooley tracks headed away, towards the road.
So, what, they're in some kind of camper/lab?
They accidentally start a fire and everybody FOs?
Yeah. Why not?
So why did that little hair-gelled shit leave his car?
Ay-yi-yi.
Gomey, it's a culture in decline.
It's a rich and vibrant culture.
It's a car that jumps up and down.
What the hell?
You people used to be conquistadors, for chrissake.
Smells like a Drakkar Noir factory in here.
I already searched it.
Yeah.
You're wasting your time.
Give it up. If this here's a trap car,
it's gonna take more than your dumb white ass to find it.
Oh, yeah? You are talking to the trap-car master,
my friend.
I'm Rain Man counting his toothpicks.
Yeah, you're like Rain Man. Retarded.
Yeah, baby.
Hello, zippy. Asshole.
Sort of looks like meth but it's, uh,
it's too damn white.
You know what I'm thinking, Gomey?
Yep. Somebody croaked our snitch.
Hey, agents.
You got something?
I don't know. It just...
It just doesn't it seem like...
Something's missing?
What about the soul?
The soul.
There's nothing but chemistry here.
Skyler?
There's something I have to tell you.

Operation Icebreaker.
How we liking that? We never used that before, did we?
Isn't that the name of a breath mint?
What? Ice Breakers, right?
Breath mint?
Nobody's gonna think that.
Gonna be thinking about some big-ass ship
in the North Pole breaking ice.
Says you. I'm gonna be thinking Operation Breath Mint.
I'm thinking Operation Breath Mint
every time you and me are on a stakeout together, all right?
Your breath can knock a buzzard off a shit wagon.
All right, Operation TBD.
Thanks for nothing, Gom.
Anyway, say hello to Domingo Gallardo Molina.
A.k.a. Krazy-8. Way smarter than your average cheese eater.
I turned him out when he was street level,
but this dude's like The Jeffersons,
moving on up.
Every small-time dealer he'd throw at us,
he'd end up snaking all their customers.
Now it turns out that he's missing, presumed dead.
Found his car out in the boonies.
Last guy he ratted out was none other than his cousin,
Emilio Koyama.
You thinking the cousin found out and took revenge?
Could be. Turns out he's missing too.
And normally I'd say someone did the world a favor.
But our snitch's car, turns out we find two grams of meth in it,
we take it to the lab, they come back,
they tell us it is the purest they've ever seen.
Ninety-nine-point-one percent.
I mean, our chemist is blown away. Said he couldn't do the same thing better.
Worse yet, it didn't come out of some super lab in Mexico,
we're thinking this was cooked right here in the Land of Enchantment.
Car was abandoned at what appears to be a cook site.
This is the, uh, only other thing left behind.
We're sending it off to Quantico,
see if they can pull something off it.
Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter element
and found the same 99.1 meth.
So be on notice.
We got new players in town.
Now, we don't know who they are, or where they come from,
but they possess an extremely high skill set.
Me, personally,
I'm thinking Albuquerque just might have a new kingpin.
Jesus, Walt, you're burning the shit out of them.
Oh. Damn it.
Hey, Sky, you got any more chicken?
Emeril here is gonna need a fresh pack.
Bam.
All right, looking good.
Is this low-fat mayonnaise in the coleslaw?
Uh, I... I don't know, it's store-bought.
Okay, uh, Hank,
you need another beer?
Does the pope shit in his hat?
Yeah, I don't think that he does, Hank,
and I think everybody would like it
if you'd stop saying that.
Marie, some more wine, maybe?
I'm all right, thanks.
All right. Hey, I want a beer.
Yeah, I want Shania Twain to give me a tuggy.
Guess what. It ain't happening either.
How about some more soda, hm?
Yeah, sure.
Honey, do you need anything?
Mm-mm. No, Walt, thank you.
Okay. Be right back.
No.
What, are you kidding me?
You look like a damn movie star, man.
Girls gotta be lining up left and right.
Tell him how good-looking he is.
He's adorable.
He doesn't wanna be fricking adorable, he wants to be hot.
Anyway, see what I'm talking about? That's female perspective.
She's supposed to say that.
Look, a guy doesn't gotta look like, uh,
you know, Charlton Heston... I'm talking Moses days.
To get a girl, all right?
You just gotta have confidence.
Confidence and, uh... And persistence.
Okay? That's what I'm talking about.
I chased your aunt Marie here all over creation.
I kept bugging her for a date, she kept saying no.
What, I asked you, like, 50 times?
Yeah, it was before they tightened the stalking laws.
Anyway, how about your dad here? That there's a good story, Walt.
Tell him how you met Skyler. Uh-huh.
Mom was a waitress
in Los Alamos, and Dad said that thing to you.
Well, actually, your mother wasn't a waitress,
it was a summer job, and, um, she was the hostess
and she also worked the cash register.
And I used to go in there a lot
because it was close enough to the lab
where I could ride my bicycle.
And once I noticed her,
it got to be so that I would only go in
when I knew she was working.
When it was slow, she would lean against the counter,
doing her crossword puzzles, uh, but kind of hiding it.
Right? Pretending that she was still working,
and once I caught on to that, I would do crossword puzzles
while I ate my grilled-cheese sandwich.
It got so that every day at lunch, we would both be doing
The New York Times crossword puzzle
10 feet from each other.
And, uh... Heh-heh.
Eventually, I caught her looking over at me,
so I began saying:
"Excuse me, um, 14 across,
seven-letter word for whatchamacallit,
uh, may I ask what?
What you wrote down?"
And, uh, well, that got us talking,
and, uh, boy, I tell you, I was...
I was terrible at those puzzles.
I don't think that I finished even one of them.
But your mother would do them in ink.
Very smooth.
I bet you didn't think your old man had it in him, huh?
But that's what I'm talking about,
that's persistence, you see?
Once you set your cap for something
or somebody, you gotta just, you know...
Whoa. Skyler.
Mom, a... Are you all right?
Hey, hey.
Shh. Honey, it's okay.
What's the matter?
What is it?
Ask him.
What's she talking about?
Walt?
Um...
I have cancer.
Lung cancer.
It's bad.
Ask him how long he's known.
I guess a month, maybe.
Oh, for God sakes, Walt.
We're just sitting out there having a cookout
like nothing's going on.
He made me promise not to tell anybody.
Christ, these last 48 hours.
And it's the weekend,
so I couldn't even get his doctor on the phone.
Buddy, why? I mean, why wouldn't you wanna tell anybody?
Walt, don't you see
everybody just wants to help you.
We're family. We get through these things together.
And I don't get, you know, lung cancer?
How can that happen? You don't even smoke.
You know, I'm thinking that this goes back 20 years, maybe,
to the applications lab,
all those chemicals they had you working around.
We... We always took the proper precautions.
One time you complained that they didn't give you
the right kind of, um, I don't know,
some kind of ventilation hood or something, and... And...
And then the headaches. Honey, it wasn't that.
How do they think they can get away with this?
We should hire a lawyer.
Okay, so first let's deal with this.
Okay, so, what's the next step for Walt?
Certainly a second opinion, right?
Right. Right, absolutely.
Okay, so first thing tomorrow, I talk to my radiologists,
we find you the best, the oncology dream team.
That's good. That's good.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, okay. Okay.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go check on Walt Jr.
I, um... I'm gonna see
if I can talk him into, I don't know, joining us.
I really didn't mean for him to find out that way.
Walt, uh...
whatever happens...
I hope this goes without saying, but, um, whatever happens,
I want you to know that, um,
I'll always take care of your family.
Yeah.
Yo, check out these, uh, fake Pop-Tarts.
These are mad tight, yo. No, thanks, man, pass.
Your loss. These are from, like, Canada, or something. Imported.
Hey, yo, what happened to your hallway, man?
Did, like, the ceiling fall down, or?
Oh, yeah, uh, no, man,
I think the house is just settling.
You know, it's been caving in left and right.
Hit me in the eye. Heh-heh.
It's bananas.
Yo, my pops could fix you up,
he's, like, a contractor or something.
Yeah? Yeah, right on, I should grab that number.
Say, Jesse, you still cook a little crystal?
Uh, could be, yeah. You know, from time to time.
I heard you lost your partner.
Emilio.
Didn't he get locked up?
No, man, uh, he's out.
His cousin bailed him out.
I think he skipped town or something.
I don't know about any of that, I've just been
kind of doing my own thing these days, so...
But you maybe got some crystal, man?
Because I could seriously go for a bowl right now, you know what I'm saying,
take the edge off.
Hell, yeah, Sunday night bowl, yo.
All right.
Well, uh, maybe it just so happens that, uh,
I just recently cooked the best batch ever.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah. Came up with this whole new recipe.
It's more like a formula.
It's, like, way, way more chemically...
Shit, you know, it's... It's just the bomb, so...
But, you know, I don't know, I've been thinking lately
I'll just lay off of it for a while,
because lately it's been kind of making me paranoid, so...
You know, for, like, health-wise, just lay off.
Yo, if you're, uh, not into sharing, man,
just tell us to piss off, it's cool.
We don't need no soap opera.
Yeah, man, whatever. No, no, it's all good, you know.
L-I'm just saying, uh, hey, I got... I got plenty of pot.
Yeah, I think I'll bounce, man.
Yeah, sounds about right.
Hey, yo, yo. Hey, homes, I'm joking.
Okay, I'm totally joking with you.
You kidding? Sit down.
Best scante ever.
Grab that pipe.
Okay, there.
Shit.
Walt, do you need some help?
Oh, no, I'm... I'm fine, honey.
I'm fine. Just, uh, privacy.
Thanks.
I'm right outside if you need me.
Okay.
Yeah, any time on Friday is absolutely fine.
Thank you so much for working us in.
Uh, can I just put that on a credit card?
Great. Perfect.
Okay, so we will see you at 10:45 on Friday morning.
Thank you so much.
Okay.
Oh, yes.
Honey, the best oncologist,
I mean, not even just in New Mexico,
but one of the top 10 in the entire nation,
his name is, um, Dr. Delcavoli
and we see him on Friday.
Ah.
I mean, Marie really came through for us.
She had her boss call, and...
Okay, this is good.
From here on out, I mean, things are gonna...
What's? What's that we're putting on a credit card?
Uh, it's just a deposit kind of thing.
How much of a deposit?
It's $5000.
Five thousand?
Jesus.
What's that, just to start?
I mean, just to tell me what I already know?
Walt, he's not in our HMO, okay?
So be it, we'll figure it out.
Come on, don't get hung up on money here.
I mean, we can always borrow from Hank.
Absolutely not.
No, I just...
We're not gonna do that.
Well, maybe we can ask your mom.
Have you even called her yet?
Walt, regardless, you're gonna have to tell her about this.
I'm willing to do it, but I... I'll call. I'll call.
Okay, look,
I don't even want us thinking about money.
Money is not the issue here.
It's not. I know. I know.
It's not.
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
I'll take care of the deposit.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'll, uh...
I'll borrow it from my pension.
Oh, damn it!
Hey. Heh-heh.
Hey, pal, what's up?
Oh, uh, yeah, no, I thought I heard mice.
Heh. Boy, that's... That's all we need, huh?
So, what's up, pal?
What the hell's wrong with you?
What?
You're... You're acting all...
You're... You...
You're all... Why are you acting so weird?
Son. You're...
You're acting like nothing is going on.
Oh, no, please. Please, please, no.
Hey, no, hey!
Hey!
Put that douche bag
on the phone.
Oh, come on.
Hey, am I? Am I gonna have to come down there
and whup your ass?
And let me tell you something else,
I'm not doing this for charity, right?
I'm hands down the best he's got in that office. He knows it, I know it,
I expect to be paid to a level commensurate with...
I said, "Dave, do you think 40 grand is a proper bonus?"
That's less than 10 percent of what I booked for you guys this quarter. Come on.
I'm not gonna sit here and be disrespect...
Oh, he's shitting bricks.
Oh, you know he is.
Yeah, that man lives in fear I'll go across town...
Hell, I could go anywhere.
Hoffman, Gordon Bradley, or Sorcher.
Even Goldberg-Wayne. They'd make me a partner at Goldberg-Wayne
just for walking in the damn door,
that's how ecstatic they'd be.
Next customer.
Hells, yes, brother man.
Dude, you should check this chick out.
Who? No. Buddy, she's a cow.
Stacey's a cow.
We're talking major barnyard boo-hog.
Roll her in flour and look for the wet spot
before you hit that, man, you know what I'm saying?
That kind of stink does not wash off.
Sir? Ha-ha-ha. Right.
Sir.
Oh, yeah?
Sorry. Hi.
Yeah. Oh, totally.
Hi. What can I do for you today?
Which dude?
Dude that looks like a lizard?
Next in line.
I, um...
He limps like some leper.
I... I'm sorry. I... I would like...
Grosses me out.
A cashier's check in the full amount,
made out to Oncology Partners of New Mexico, please.
Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y.
Yeah, you got it.
I don't understand why
they're forcing you to choose between the piccolo and the oboe.
You show so much promise with both.
They say they can't have any switching between woodwinds.
Because no matter how they divide it up, someone would be left out.
Well, rules are rules, I guess.
Sure, rules are rules. I'm all for that.
But I'm telling you, you really shine on that oboe.
You have real talent, and I'm not just saying that.
Thanks.
What about Mr. Pemberton?
Is he giving you enough individual attention?
I'd have to say so. He tries to talk to each one of us
at least once during every practice.
That's good. Feedback's important.
It's key, I think.
Hey, so how was soccer practice?
I think that was in our backyard.
Who's there?
What the hell are you doing out here?
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Mom.
Jake.
Got new patio furniture.
Right on.
Hey. Heh-heh. My leg.
What do you think it could be?
God knows I'm no expert.
I don't know. Uppers, downers? Your guess is as good as mine.
I think we should check his arms for needle marks.
Do we let him stay?
The Presbyterian Church has those meetings.
So maybe on condition, you know? If he agrees to attend.
I... I just don't know what to tell Jake.
Hey.
Hey. Good evening.
Well? Sleep well?
What time's, uh?
What time is dinner?
In about an hour.
You know, I could, uh, wash those clothes if you like.
They look a little lived in.
Oh, um, no, that's cool. Yeah, maybe later.
We are not doing this again.
Adam... No.
We said we'd lay down the law, we lay down the law.
We just have to be consistent about it.
Hey.
You're, uh...
You're not taking the bus?
Oh.
All right. Well, listen.
Um, give me maybe another 20 minutes,
and we'll get out of here.
All right.
Yeah, good.
You know, I... I just think that, uh...
things have a way of working themselves out.
Wow.
When did you, uh? When did you get this?
Last May at the year-end assembly.
They gave me that one too. The one on the end.
Environmental Consciousness Award.
What's that mean? What, you, like, recycle cans and shit?
I contacted The Albuquerque Journal
and asked what kind of chemicals they use to bleach their paper.
They wound up writing an article about it.
Right on, little bro.
Making mad inroads with the business community.
All right.
Now, hey, remember,
not all learning comes out of books.
Look at you. Heh.
You know, we should... We should hang out more often.
You know, just, uh... Just kick back and chill.
I mean, if you ever, like, I don't know, need advice.
Because, you know, I've been...
I've been through it all. For real.
Yeah, man, you, uh? You play the flute?
It's a piccolo, actually.
Dude, play some, uh... Play some Jethro Tull.
Hey, guys, how we doing in here?
We're, uh... We're good.
Jake?
Yeah. Fine, Mom.
Well, that's good. That's... That's great.
You know, what the hell? You see this?
What am I, some criminal or something?
Whatever.
Whatever?
What, you? You think that's okay?
Like, "Oh, we can't let that scumbag
warp the mind of our favorite son."
I'm the favorite?
Yeah, right.
You're practically all they ever talk about.
Oh, snap.
Awesome.
Yeah?
Yo, man, it's me.
Hey, listen. You know that, uh? That product?
You got any more of that?
No, man, okay? I'm done giving out freebies.
You want charity, go ask the Salvation Army.
No, no charity. No.
I got this cousin, he's got him some rich friends.
These dudes are in town, they're looking to party.
And your stuff is, like, so sweet.
So, what do you say?
You up for making some fat stacks?
Because they'll buy everything you got.
Yes. Yes. Okay.
Oh, you can't be serious.
What the hell are you doing here?
Yo, I waited till the ball buster left.
I mean, no offense.
Who sent you, huh? Huh?
You wearing a wire? Hey. Jesus.
You setting me up?
Homo. A wire? You want a wire?
I got a wire. Speak into the mike, bitch.
What the hell's wrong with you?
A wire.
Jesus.
So who did you tell about?
Nobody. What, are you nuts?
Then why are you here?
I don't know.
To, like, touch base.
Touch base?
Yeah, you know, um,
what they call a debrief.
Maybe we could, like...
Thought we could debrief.
Debrief?
Wow, that's...
That's what you think we need, debrief?
Yeah, after what happened,
it just seems like the thing to do.
Kind of, you know, talk about it.
I mean, we can't... We can't talk to anybody else.
Anyway, th... That and I wanted to, uh...
Wanted to, you know,
tell you how much everybody digs that meth we cooked.
Everybody digs the meth we cooked.
Seriously. I got dudes that would give their left nut
for a little more.
Oh. Great.
I'm just saying, I mean, if you ever,
you know, saw your way clear to, um, you know,
you and I cooking a little more...
Wow.
Get the hell off my property.
What? I'm just saying. Go. And don't come back.
Now.
All right. All right, you know what?
Four grand.
Your share from selling that batch.
That's why I'm here.
Yeah, yeah, that's right. Hey, I didn't smoke it all.
Non-small-cell adenocarcinoma.
Stage 3A,
which means it's spread from the lung to the lymph nodes.
There's no denying it's very serious.
But it... Is it?
It is...
curable?
I prefer the word "treatable."
But the treatments we have at our disposal
can be very effective.
Without making any promises,
I can tell you that the specific course
of radiation and chemotherapy I'm going to suggest
has been successful.
In certain cases, it's prolonged a patient's life
and even resulted in remission.
Hmm. Um, what about the side effects?
Well, they can be mild to practically non-existent.
Or they can be pretty darn awful.
It varies from patient to patient.
Typically, there's hair loss,
which begins a couple of weeks after the start of chemotherapy.
You may find yourself unusually fatigued, not much energy.
You won't want to get out of bed.
You may lose weight due to reduced appetite
and certain intestinal issues.
Muscle aches and pains, gums will get sore and bleed.
And, uh, of course, there's the possibility of nausea,
although we'll prescribe an antiemetic
and try to counteract that.
Possible kidney or bladder irritation.
You may wind up with increased bruising and bleeding.
There are maybe sexual symptoms. Your skin may become dry...
Got anything to say?
What do you know about that?
Nothing.
Well, that's not gonna fly this time.
How many chances have we given you?
How many times have we sat right here
and had the same conversation over and over again?
Where you look us in the eye and you plead ignorance?
And you play on our emotions
and you tell us anything and everything
you think we wanna hear, just so we'll give you another chance.
Mm-hm. And it makes us feel like fools.
Every time.
Enough, Jesse.
Enough.
We are not going to have this in our house.
We need you to leave.
Thanks for not telling on me.
Uh, you think I could have it back?
It's skunk-weed anyway.
While 3 percent are listed as unknown.
The Air Force is aware of the widely-held belief
that some of these could be flying saucers from...
You know, this is actually very hopeful.
Nothing conclusive in the evidence,
but probing and digesting of information about UFOs
continues unceasingly.
Did you hear me?
I said this is really very, very hopeful.
Oh.
Defense Command in Colorado Springs issued an order...
So can I call them and?
And tell them you'll start next week?
Uh...
Even as they did so, the military wondered whether
their scientific know-how and their best weapons
would be effective in any battle
of the Earth versus the flying saucers.
I just think that we need to discuss it
a little more, that's all.
What is there to discuss?
You're gonna get the best treatment, and he's the best.
Well, there's the money discussion. I think...
No, $90,000 out of pocket.
Maybe more.
There's a way, Walt.
There's financing, there's, um, installment plans.
I... I could always go back to work.
Walt, there's always a way.
All right.
Skyler, say that there is a way.
And we spend all that money, and...
Am I supposed to leave you with all that debt?
No.
Honey.
I just don't want emotions ruling us.
Maybe treatment isn't the way to go.
Then why don't you just
fucking die, already?
Just give up and die.
Come on, move your ass.
Uh, name of the guy? You'll like him.
Yeah, dude, I'm not worried.
I got the best fricking attorney.
I would not want to be on the other side of this one.
He's got this little team of ninjas, too,
that go out and do forward operations...
He's got crap on people.
What the hell?
What?
Don't go near it, buddy.
What? What are you doing? Call somebody.
Call the fire people.
Yeah. I have a fire...
I don't believe this. Do you know how much I paid for that?
Why are you doing this?
ï»¿1
Here is, uh... Here's my rÃ©sumÃ©.
I mean, technically it says "curriculum vitae,"
which I think is more professional, but, you know,
same thing, pretty much.
That's... Wow, great.
This position truly is a no-experience-necessary kind of thing.
Well, and it doesn't really say it here,
but I have a solid background in sales.
I'm pretty much a self-starter, so...
That's excellent, but... Excellent.
I just... I really feel I could be a major,
major asset to your sales force.
Ah.
I'm thinking there's a little misunderstanding.
This isn't actually a sales job.
I mean, I'd be happy to consider you for a sales position,
but all our agents need to be licensed,
have at least two years on-the-job experience
and usually a college degree.
Oh.
What you'll be doing is more like
advertising.
Hey, Jesse.
Hey, man.
Yo, man.
What up? Badger?
Where you been keeping yourself?
Nice duds.
Yeah, you too.
Thanks.
Yo, why would you wanna do this lame-ass job, anyway?
I mean, no offense.
Because I'm on probation, yo.
I gotta prove to the man I'm rehabilitated.
Upstanding citizen, all that shit.
It's really good exercise too. Look.
You can't just stand there, you have to spin the arrow.
There's all these moves you have to learn, like "the helicopter."
Wow.
Yeah. See, yeah?
That one's a bitch.
I'm not very good at it yet.
Well, you really opened my eyes to the possibilities.
Yeah. Hey, anyways,
thanks for the toke. Any time.
Speaking of which,
you think you could maybe hook me up with some crystal?
Ah, no, I've been out of the business for a while.
Actually, now thinking about retiring.
What? No. Yeah.
That stuff you made is unbelievable.
It was pretty awesome.
Retirement?
Ah! I can't be hearing this.
No, man, I had this partner who was helping me cook.
I mean, I was doing most of the work...
but he was an asshole, so...
Anyway, I mean, pseudo's getting harder and harder to come by and...
Yo, I can hook you up with some pseudo.
Major pseudo.
I got channels, bro.
We could partner up.
Huh?
No pressure.
No pressure. Just think about it, all right?
Oh, shit. I gotta go.
Yo, this way to savings.
Save your dollar bills, y'all.
âª This way to savings This way to savings âª
Come on! Save some money.
It's a stupid gift.
No, it isn't. He'll love it.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Didn't the invitation even say "no gifts"?
Walt. What?
We have to go.
I know, I'm not complaining.
Yes, you are.
Look, we need this.
We've been through a lot lately. Okay?
Jesus, guess we didn't get the "beige" memo.
Ah, we're okay.
Yes, I look like I'm wearing a prom dress from 1985.
Honey, you look fine.
Walt, this is the only thing I could find that fit me.
God, would you look at that. The invitation said "no gifts."
So? Come on.
Sir, I'll take that for you.
Thank you. You're welcome.
Ahem. Oh, look, there's Elliott.
Oh, come on, let's go say hello.
Elliott. Ha.
Walt. You made it.
Happy birthday. Wouldn't miss it for the world.
Thank you. Skyler.
Hi. Oh. Oh, that's right.
Great to see you. You look beautiful, as always.
Oh. Well, these days a little more big than beautiful, but...
Of course, congratulations. That was such great news.
Thank you. Gretchen, look who's here.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, it's been ages.
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Oh, it's really good. Heh-heh.
Skyler, welcome. Congratulations.
Thank you. It's really nice to be here.
When are you due?
In about 10 more weeks.
And actually, we recently found out that it's a girl.
Oh, that's so wonderful. Yeah.
Yeah, we've been thinking about it for ourselves.
Yeah, thinking about it.
Uh, oh, hey, by the way,
securing that patent was just amazing.
I mean, the work that your company is doing...
Congratulations to both of you.
Hard work and a lot of luck. A lot. Yeah. Oh, well, now.
Elliott.
Uh, will you excuse us? We gotta say hi.
Make yourselves at home, we'll catch up later.
Sure, sure. Okay.
Okay. So glad you're here.
Thank you. Bye.
John, Missy. How are you?
Shall we?
Congratulations. Happy birthday.
Oh.
Wow.
Hm. Hm.
Walt?
I thought that was you.
Farley. Long time no see.
This is Walter White. Oh. Hello.
Back at Caltech, he was...
You were just a master of crystallography.
I remember this one time
we were stuck on this protein problem for weeks.
You just breezed right in,
and you had one word for us...
Synchrotrons. Mm.
It was synchrotrons, yeah.
They generate pure
and more complete patterns than x-ray beams.
Data collection takes a fraction of the time.
This is the White in Gray Matter.
Tell them, Walt.
Okay.
Well, back when Elliott and I were in grad school,
we came up with the name. Ahem.
Schwartz, black. Walter White.
So together they became Gray Matter Technologies.
Cute, huh? So you run the company with Elliott?
No. No, that's Gretchen and Elliott.
Yeah, yeah. You know, I gravitated toward education.
Ah. What university?
Oh, wow, it's a Stratocaster.
Not just any Strat.
That's one of Clapton's.
No way.
"To Elliott, sorry about the buckle rash, Eric Clapton."
Thank you. This is beautiful.
Why is he doing this?
Beautiful.
What is he, like 8 years old?
Here, honey.
Thanks.
Oh, this is from Walt.
Oh, God. It's okay.
Hey.
Let's see what we got.
Yum Good Ramen.
This is what Walt and I lived on
for, uh, 10 months straight
while we were working on our thesis.
Sold them down at Ralstow's in the hardware aisle.
Right next to the... What was it?
Sterno. Yeah.
The Sterno.
Yeah, 10 for a dollar ninety-nine.
To this day, I am convinced these noodles
were responsible for our success.
This was our lifeblood.
Man, where'd you find these? I thought they'd been outlawed years ago.
I love it.
Thank you, Walt.
Well...
For the man who has everything.
No, no, no.
It was.
No, you remember the fat guy.
Yes. We used to call him Snot Trough.
He had that thing under his nose.
What do you call that thing? That was Dobkins.
That was the same guy who always smelled like chocolate milk.
It was. No, no, no.
It wasn't Dobkins, it was...
Anyway, I swear to Christ, he used to iron those patches
onto the elbows of his Members Only jacket
because he thought it made him look more distinguished.
Didn't it? I thought it... No.
Oh, God. Well, here's to Snot Trough.
To Snot Trough. Wherever you may be.
God bless him.
And you remember the professor who used to hate Robert Wilhelm Bunsen?
Yes. All you had to do was mention the Bunsen burner
and he was off on a rant.
"Oh, he didn't invent it." Do you remember the waving?
"He just improved it," you know.
It was easy to kill 15 minutes.
Yeah.
Oh, God. I miss this, Walt.
Yeah. Me too.
Listen, we ought to get together more often.
Skyler and I would love to have you and Gretchen over for dinner sometime.
Oh, sure, yeah, absolutely.
But, you know, what I mean is that you and I should work together again.
Are you gonna teach high school? No, no, no, seriously.
What's stopping us?
Wait a minute, Elliott, what are you...?
Are you asking me to come work for you at Gray Matter?
Yeah, why not? You'd fit right in.
You're brilliant, you got a ton of experience.
Well, I...
I wouldn't really know where to begin. I mean...
God, you have no idea.
I spend my days just drawing out atoms on the chalkboard
and trying to get these kids to learn the periodic table.
Look, I understand.
You're a little rusty, but you're not seeing the upside here.
We could really benefit from a new set of eyes.
You know what it's like when you've been trying to crack some problem
for months on end, you get tunnel vision.
One guy thinking outside of the box, you may be exactly what we need.
Well, listen, Elliott, it...
The offer is very appealing, it really is, I thank you.
But there's...
There's something you should know.
I have some personal issues.
Look, there's nothing we can't work out.
Well, yeah,
but it's complicated.
We can help you.
We have excellent health insurance.
The best.
Ahem. Um, hey, did you try those prosciutto-wrapped figs?
They were, like, wow. They were just...
I must have had about 30 of those suckers.
Oh, and the seafood table, did you see that?
They had lobster tail, they had crab legs, like, shrimp.
They had...
Walt. What the hell did you say to Elliott?
What? You told him about the cancer,
didn't you? Didn't you?
I can't believe it.
Okay, we were talking, he asked how you were doing,
and I am sorry, but I don't have the best poker face these days where that's concerned.
He knew something was wrong with you, and he pressed me.
He pressed you? Come on.
Walt, when it came right down to it,
I didn't know what else to do but tell him the truth.
The truth? Well, how about you just said, "He's fine," huh?
You think maybe you could just have said that? "He's fine." And then it would have been done.
I don't like the way you're talking to me.
I don't like the way you talk about my private affairs
to people who are not even in our lives anymore.
Well, what exactly did he say to you?
He offered me a job. What?
Yes. Kind of like some fig leaf, you know.
Some face-saving bullshit
that allowed me to generously accept his charity.
And then when I turned that down, he flat out
offered to pay for my treatment.
Which is exactly what you expected him to do, didn't you?
Walt. Didn't you?
No. I did not put him up... Please. Come on. Come on.
Okay, what did you say?
Walt?
What do you think I said?
Why? Walt.
Hm. Ready to go?
I'm taking the bus.
Okay.
Bye, honey.
Hey, dude. Are these bullet holes?
Uh...
No, man. Those are for, like, you know,
uh, ventilation.
Cool.
Ooh. Nice setup, huh?
Man. This is nothing, man.
I used to have, like, twice as much glassware,
until my dumb-ass ex-partner
drove us into a ditch and wrecked most of it.
Big-ass beaker, huh?
Hey, wait, wait, no, that's... Yeah, that's a boiling flask.
This is a beaker.
Here's a Griffin beaker. Here's a volumetric beaker.
Here's an Erlenmeyer flask.
Um, you got...
Wow. You really know your shit.
It's just basic chemistry, yo.
So...
you got something for me?
Aw, hells, yeah.
Okay. We're in business.
Right on, Badger.
Dude, check this out.
Jesus.
What the hell are you bringing that for?
Hunting.
We might see javelinas.
Are you gonna help me or what?
Hey.
Badger!
Huh? Huh? Yeah?
Yeah, buddy. Huh? Yeah.
Let's see the money.
Here.
I need five each. Come on, two more.
Here.
What about him?
Are you kidding? He looks younger than us.
Whatever.
What about that guy?
No, he looks like a businessman.
So what?
So businessmen are always in a hurry.
They're always, like, going to some meeting or something.
Seriously, he's just gonna say no.
Hey, hey, this guy.
This is our guy. You're up.
Huh? Why do I have to do it?
Give me the crutches and I'll go do it.
Shit.
Um, excuse me, hey,
we forgot our IDs, and we were wondering
if you could do us a favor and buy us a six-pack?
You know, what you're asking is illegal.
Um, no, it's not.
Yeah, it is.
Oh, shit.
Guess you win the jackpot.
This is not how I wanted to spend my night off.
Consider this your first and last warning.
Yes, sir.
You're lucky you got a good dad here.
If the other guys hadn't run,
I could've talked my way out of it.
Not cool, man. Not cool.
What, you never tried to buy beer when you were my age?
No, I'm talking about you calling me and not your father.
How do you think that'd make him feel?
I don't even know what to say to you.
Just go.
I'll deal with you later.
Phew.
Where's Walt?
I haven't seen him since this morning. Your guess is as good as mine.
Listen, do me a favor, all right?
Don't tell him about the kid.
He's just a teenager trying to score some beer.
You know,
just growing pains.
I mean, he finds out his dad's sick, he starts acting out, you know?
First the pot, then this.
The pot?
You told me the kid was smoking reefer.
That's what Skyler told me.
I mean, you may as well have. I wasn't talking about Walter, Jr.
I was talking about Walt.
Excuse me?
He admitted it.
He said he liked it.
Walt?
Mm-hm.
Shit.
I didn't think he had it in him.
It's like he's not himself lately.
Yeah. I mean,
why would anyone in their right mind choose not to do treatment?
Especially when it's completely paid for.
Why is he doing this?
You know what we need to do?
What we really need to do is sit him down, all of us,
and get everything out on the table.
Talk it all through.
You mean an intervention? No, no.
Just a family meeting.
Where everyone can voice their concerns
and be heard.
You are a genius, bro.
This cankenstein is unreal.
When we get back, I'm gonna burn that dollar-bill suit
because we're gonna make some mad dough.
It's not right.
What do you mean, it's not right?
It's cloudy. It's not supposed to be cloudy.
Okay, that last time, it was glass.
So what? Cloudy, not cloudy? It looks good enough to me.
Good enough.
Wait, wait. Yo, what are you doing?
Aah!
Are you out of your mind? I totally would've smoked that.
Look, it's not for you, it's for our customers.
They're gonna demand a certain standard.
What? What...? What are you...?
What? We'll just do it again.
Until we get it right.
Walt.
Please have a seat and join us.
We can do better.
No, don't you fucking think about it.
Hey. Come on.
Three entire pounds of pseudo wasted.
Do you know how long I had to spin that stupid sign?
Get off me, psycho. Helicopter, bitch!
Ah, God!
Asshole.
Open the door.
Come back here, you bitch!
I'm gonna mess you up!
This isn't funny!
I really need to understand your thought process,
because clearly I don't.
I feel that this decision you've made
is not only not in your best interest,
it's not in the best interest of our entire family.
Look, Skyler...
Not yet, please. L...
I have the talking pillow.
Everybody gets to speak their minds, remember?
And then you'll get your chance.
Money has always been an issue for us, I'll give you that.
But now that Elliott is more than willing to pitch in...
Walt, I know, I understand that it's hard for you to accept help.
Maybe it's the way you were raised.
But, honey,
it's okay to lean on people now and again.
You need this treatment.
And nothing can stop you from getting it,
except you.
Am I allowed to respond?
In a minute.
I think we need to go around the circle first.
Hank, would you like to start?
Uh, yeah. Okay, well...
What I would say is... Take the talking pillow.
All right, look, buddy, um,
I know I don't get to tell you this enough,
but I care about you.
A hell of a lot.
And this cancer thing...
Let's just... Let's face it, you know, you were dealt a shit hand.
But, um,
sometimes your luck can change.
I mean... I mean, I can't tell you how many times I was...
You know, I started with a shit hand
and I ended up with, you know, a full house. Okay?
I mean, the key is, you gotta hang in there.
Man, you gotta keep placing your bets,
keep placing your bets. Boom.
Hank, what the hell are you saying?
Please, Marie, let him talk.
That's what we're here to do. Please.
Go on, Hank.
All right, look at it this way, okay?
It's the bottom of the ninth, bases are loaded, you're up.
But you got a bum arm, right?
There's no fricking way you're gonna hit a homer, okay?
So you can either let the pinch hitter take the bat,
or you can hold on to your pride and lose the game.
You get what I'm saying?
No.
You got your pride, man. I get it, okay? I get it.
But this Daddy Warbucks wants to chip in, man.
I'm with your old lady on this one. I say take the money and run, man.
Somebody wanna take this thing? Here.
Yes, Walter...
Walter, Jr., I'm sure
that you have about a million things to say, probably.
And now is your chance.
Go ahead. Just let it all out.
This is bullshit.
Hey, come on.
It's all right.
It...
Talk.
Tell your dad how you feel.
I'm pissed off. Tell him.
I'm pissed off.
Because you're being...
You're...
You're a pussy.
You're, like, ready to give up.
You're... God.
What if you gave up on me, huh?
This here,
all the stuff I've been through,
and you're scared of a little chemotherapy?
Me, personally,
I think you should do whatever you wanna do.
What?
You told us to be honest about our feelings.
Walt's the one with cancer, it's his decision.
It's not up to any of us.
Why in hell would you do this? Hey, hey.
I wasn't planning on agreeing with Walt.
But after sitting here and listening to you all talk about his future like he has no say in it...
He's not gonna have a future if he doesn't get treatment.
I am a medical professional.
I x-ray people in treatment every day.
I see them every day. And you know what?
Some of them are absolutely miserable.
Marie... I'm sorry, but it's true.
And some of them don't wanna
spend their last weeks or months
being picked at by doctors.
But they got talked into it by their families.
Can I get the pillow back? I agree with Marie on this one.
Thank you.
Hank...
What? Maybe Walt wants to die like a man, all right?
I don't want him to die at all.
That's the whole point of this. So either help or leave.
Skyler, I just wanted to do you the courtesy
of giving you my honest opinion.
You know, Marie, this is not debate club.
This is my husband's life we're talking about here.
You know, I made one simple observation...
And it's like you... How dare you...
Okay, so we disagree... Ladies! Marie!
This is so stupid.
All right, I've got the talking pillow now.
Okay?
We all, in this room,
we love each other.
We want what's best for each other, and I know that.
I am very thankful for that.
But what I want...
What I want, what I need...
is a choice.
What does that mean?
Sometimes I feel like I never actually
make any of my own choices,
I mean.
My entire life,
it just seems I never...
you know, had a real say about any of it.
Now, this last one, cancer,
all I have left is how I choose to approach this.
Then make the right choice, Walt.
You are not the only one it affects.
What about your son?
Don't you wanna see your daughter grow up? I just...
Of course I do.
Skyler, you've read the statistics, you...
These doctors
talking about "surviving"
one year, two years, like it's the only thing that matters.
But what good is it to just survive
if I am too sick to work?
To enjoy a meal?
To make love?
For what time I have left...
I wanna live in my own house.
I wanna sleep in my own bed.
I don't wanna choke down 30 or 40 pills every single day,
and lose my hair,
and lie around, too tired to get up,
and so nauseated that I can't even move my head.
And you.
Cleaning up after me.
And me? What...?
Some, uh...
Some dead man, some artificially alive...
Just marking time.
No. No.
And that's how you would remember me.
That's the worst part.
So that is my thought process, Skyler.
I'm sorry. I just...
I choose not to do it.
All right.
"All right" what?
I'll do the treatment.
It's gonna be okay.
Okay.
The lady from the billing office
said they usually bill the insurance company directly.
But since our HMO's not paying for it, we can pay up front with a credit card.
Oh. Good.
Oh, and then Elliott will send a check, right?
I will take care of it, yeah.
Walter White?
Yes.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
See you in a minute. Okay. Okay.
Heh-heh. Elliott.
Walt, it's Gretchen.
Oh, hey. Hey, Gretchen, how are you?
You know, it was really great seeing you two the other day, you know.
Wow, what a party.
Walt, Elliott told me about the cancer.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you know,
it is what it is, I guess.
I don't know what to say.
Except, I'm always here for you.
Both of us are. We wanted you to know that.
Yeah, well, thank you.
Walt, Elliott told me he'd offered to pay for the treatment.
You have to accept.
That money, as far as we're both concerned, that belongs to you.
Even the name of our company, it's half yours.
Walt?
Is this about you and me?
Gretchen, I really appreciate the offer.
I do. But we're fine.
As it turns out, the insurance came through after all.
So, um, I am covered. And, uh...
Well, and, anyway, I really appreciate it, I really do.
Thank you.
Good. That's good news.
You know, that really was a great party.
Keep in touch, okay? Sure. Sure.
And thank you for calling.
Yo!
Wanna cook?
ï»¿1
Let's get something straight.
This, the chemistry, is my realm.
I am in charge of the cooking.
Out there on the street, you deal with that.
As far as our customers go, I don't want to know anything about them.
I don't wanna see them, I don't wanna hear from them.
I want no interaction with them whatsoever.
This operation is you and me, and I'm the silent partner.
You got any issues with that?
Whatever, man.
No matter what happens,
no more bloodshed.
No violence.
Walt? Mm.
You all right? Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm okay.
You know, honey, you... You really don't have to...
Look, I like being here with you.
Yeah.
I'm only saying that, you know, I'd be okay,
that really, if you wanna go...
You know, actually, it would make me feel a little better
knowing that you were there when Walter Jr. Gets home from school.
Okay.
All right. So you'll call me when you're finished?
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Oh, uh, and have you been in touch with Elliott?
Because I haven't seen a check from him.
Yes, I... I got it.
Really? It came, yeah. And I...
Yeah, it did. It came last week,
and I put it right into my credit union account.
So I'm taking care of it.
Good. Yeah.
So we're good. We're good.
Could you not deposit this until Monday?
Thank you.
Call if the discomfort's too much, otherwise we'll see you next week.
Yeah.
Chemical reactions involve change on two levels:
Matter and energy.
When a reaction is gradual, the change in energy is slight.
I mean, you don't even notice the reaction is happening.
For example, when rust collects on the underside of a car, right?
But if a reaction happens quickly,
otherwise harmless substances can interact in a way
that generates enormous bursts of energy.
Uh. Uh...
Who can give me an example of rapid chemical reaction?
Hint, hint. Right here.
Like, an explosion?
Yes, good. Explosions.
Explosions are the result of chemical reactions
happening almost instantaneously.
And the faster reactants, i.e. Explosives...
And fulminative mercury is a prime example of that.
The faster they undergo change,
the more violent the explosion.
Explosions.
Okay, listen, why don't you start reading on your own
from the top of chapter seven, all right?
You okay?
I got it, Mr. White.
Don't worry.
You got kids to teach.
Thanks, Hugo.
He's starting to lose weight,
which is tough, to see that.
I can already feel the difference when I put my arms around him.
Can I talk to...? Of course.
Walt.
When you don't let me in,
when you don't tell me what's going on...
I mean, it's like I feel like you don't even want me around sometimes.
No.
And recently, these afternoons,
when you're coming home so late,
and we're just left wondering where you are.
Yeah, Dad.
What's up with that?
Walt, is there anything else you're holding back from your family?
Now's the time to share.
Well, I, uh...
I like to be alone, I mean, at times.
And it's not about you, really.
It's just that sometimes it feels better
not to talk at all
about anything
to anyone.
Alone time can be helpful, for some types.
Maybe knowing what you do when you're alone
might make it easier for your family to be more accepting
of whatever it is you do alone.
Yeah.
Well,
I like to go on walks
a couple of times a week, maybe more, after work.
And I really enjoy the nature.
You know, the cacti,
vegetation, that kind of thing.
And it's really very therapeutic.
Yo, God, are you okay?
Hey, you did that shit? I'm dizzy. No.
I'm just dizzy. I need air.
God, I feel like I'm burning up. Sit down, sit down.
I gotta... Take this off.
Sit down, get some air.
Oh, God.
Here.
Better? Yeah, that's better.
When were you gonna tell me?
Tell you what?
Cancer.
You got it, right?
How did you know?
My aunt had one of those dots on her
to target the radiation. What, is it in your lung?
I'm your partner, man, you should've told me.
God, that's not cool, okay? Not at all.
What stage are you?
Three-A.
Gone into your lymph nodes.
Your aunt,
how bad was she when they caught it?
Bad enough, she didn't last long.
How long? Seven months.
God.
I get it now.
That's why you're doing all this.
You want to make some cash for your people before you check out.
You got a problem with that? You tell me.
You're the one that looks like he just crawled out of a microwave.
You gonna be able to finish the batch?
Yes.
All right.
No.
You do it.
Me?
Yeah.
What happened to your mad skills?
Go on. Here.
You do it.
You can do it.
If you have any questions, I'll be right out here.
The next time, put an ice pack on your head during chemo.
My aunt said it helped with the hair loss.
What's this, Christmas?
This that one we found way out in the boonies at the cook site?
Holy shit. What?
Lab says they pulled up an imprint of some old writing used to be on the inside,
Magic Marker or something. Yeah? What's it say?
"Property of J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab."
That's Walt's school.
We were supposed to start at 3.
Hey, I'm out there making fat stacks, man. Chill.
Hey, prepaid cell phone. Use it.
How much is this? Twenty-six big ones.
Is that all? Twenty-six thousand dollars?
No, that's 2600, and your share is 13,
minus 25 bucks for that phone.
How much meth did you sell? Nearly an ounce.
Last time I checked,
there were 16 ounces to a pound. What did you do with the rest, smoke it?
Yo, I've been out there all night slinging crystal.
You think it's cake moving a pound of meth one teenth at a time?
So why are you selling it in such small quantities?
Why don't you just sell the whole pound at once?
To who? What do I look like, Scarface?
This is unacceptable. I am breaking the law here.
This return is too little for the risk.
I thought you'd be ready for another pound today.
You may know a lot about chemistry, man,
but you don't know jack about slinging dope.
Well, I'll tell you, I know a lack of motivation when I see it.
Oh, my...
Come on, you've gotta be more imaginative, you know, just...
Just think outside the box here.
We have to move our product in bulk, wholesale.
Now, how do we do that?
What do you mean, to, like, a distributor?
Yes. Yes, that's what we need.
We need a distributor. Now, do you know anyone like that?
Yeah, I mean, I used to, until you killed him.
So who took Krazy-8's place?
Some guy named Tuco.
Badass, from what I hear.
Tuco, okay. So then just go talk to Tuco.
Right. Like, "Hello, sir. Hey, I know you don't know me,
but would you be interested in a felony quantity of methamphetamine?"
Well, yes, but maybe with a little more salesmanship, perhaps?
You just don't get it, man. Okay? This guy's OG.
What... What does that mean? Jesus, look, he's off our level, man.
He's not gonna do business with some dude he doesn't know.
You just don't understand the way it works.
You can't just bum-rush some high-level ice man
and start cutting deals.
Okay? It's risky. You need an intro, you need someone to vouch.
Well, who introduced you to Krazy-8?
Emilio, and that's only because I knew him from, like, third grade.
And we can't talk to Emilio either, because...
All right, all right, all right.
Look, I'm telling you, Mr. White, it's too risky. Okay?
I mean, we're making money. Why can't you just be satisfied
with the way it is? Oh, come on! Jesus!
Just grow some fucking balls!
Wow.
Wait till Monday again? Yes, please. Thank you.
Oh, God.
Mr. White.
Thank you, Hugo.
Knock, knock. Oh, hey.
How you feeling, Walt? Good. Yeah.
Are you up for having a visitor?
Hey, buddy. Hank.
Well, let me know if you need anything, huh?
I will. Thank you, Carmen. No problem.
Damn.
Chick's got an ass like an onion, makes me wanna cry.
So, what...? What are you doing here?
Well, I had some questions I wanted to run by you, work-related.
You feeling okay? I can come back later.
No, no, no, I'm fine. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
What do you mean, "work-related," though?
Do you recognize that?
No. No.
Well, that was used to cook meth.
Found it out on some Indian land about 40 miles from here.
Old label on the inside used to say:
"J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab." Really?
I don't understand how that came from here.
Well, I was hoping you could help me with that.
We found it near an abandoned car that belonged to one of our snitches.
A snitch?
Yeah, one of our confidential informants.
Went missing a while back.
No body yet, but we're pretty sure, you know:
Probably chopped up into little pieces and fed to the buzzards.
Anyway, you...
Any respirators like that go missing lately?
No. No.
No, I mean, not that I know of.
I'll need to look at that inventory. Sure.
Sure. I've got a list hanging on the wall.
Do you mind if I take a look at your storeroom?
Not at all. No.
Be my guest.
All right, so who's got keys?
The science faculty, the staff, Carmen,
the vice-principal has the master, and me.
How about students?
No, no. No students have keys.
Shit, I should hope not. My question is,
do any of the little pissants know where you keep them?
Uh... I don't... I don't think so, no.
I mean, besides, I keep them right here in my pocket anyway, so...
Walt, look, I know they're your students,
but do not underestimate them. Big mistake.
Are there any other respirators? Um, no.
Because I'm counting six, inventory says eight.
Hm.
Glassware looking a little sparse. Is it?
Yeah. You're missing a couple of Erlenmeyer flasks, at least.
Oh, yeah.
A five-thousand milliliter round-bottom.
Meth heads love to brew in this baby.
You gonna answer that? Oh, no, it's just... No, I don't...
Maybe it's Skyler and she's in trouble or something.
I mean, shit, don't ignore it on my account. Answer it. Come on, I got stuff to do.
Jeez. Okay.
Hello?
Yo, what's up, Mr. W?
Speaking.
Bad time to talk? Absolutely.
All right, so just listen.
So you know that guy we were talking about, Tuco?
Turns out my boy, Skinny Pete, was in the same cell block with him
over at Los Lunas.
So we got our in. We're hauling a pound to the dude right now.
Okay, then. Well, thank you. Thank you very much for calling.
My doctor is very solicitous.
Hey, look, buddy. The last thing I wanna do is get you in hot water.
But some meth-monkey had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?
You gotta keep better watch over your turf.
I will.
We don't want people to start wondering about you, right?
Right. No. Right. Absolutely not.
So you're sure you're tight with this guy?
Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.
Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete.
Skinny dick.
Maybe this isn't such a good idea, yo. Come on.
Yeah, man, that's what's happening.
Yo, Tuco's expecting us.
No need, man. Me and Tuco go back.
Tuco, what's happening, my brother?
Sick crib, yo. You've been keeping it real since you been sprung.
What's it been, like, a year? This your boy?
Yeah, Jesse. Dude with the glass I was telling you about.
Hey, man, yeah. I've heard a lot about you.
Break out the ice.
Take a bump. No worries, man, I'm no cop.
I said, hit it.
All right.
This kicks like a mule with his balls wrapped in duct tape.
Where'd you get it? I cooked it.
Bullshit.
Who you working for?
No one, man. I mean, I have a partner that I cook with, but that's it.
All right.
We got a deal.
See, I told you Tuco would hook you up.
Cool. I haven't said how much.
All right. How much?
Thirty-five large for the pound.
Well, I mean, you're a little light, ese.
It's all right, don't sweat it. It's all good.
It's good. Go on, get out of here.
What about the money? You'll get it.
This is a consignment operation.
You want me to float thirty-five G's?
You don't trust me?
Hey, no, no, hey. It's not that, man.
It's just, you know, I don't do business that way.
Tough shit, the deal is done.
You said this was cool, okay? Money for meth, cash up front.
Don't front, dude, Tuco's good for it.
I don't need your punk ass to vouch for me.
Come on.
Oh, come on.
All right. You brought me some really clean crystal. Hoo!
You really want your money up front?
Up front.
Nobody moves crystal in the South Valley but me, bitch.
Morning, Hugo.
You don't mind if I call you Hugo, Hugo?
We've never had a problem with Hugo, ever.
Is that Uncle Hank?
Right, what do you got there? All right. Book him.
Uncle Hank's arresting Mr. Archilleya.
This doesn't make any sense to me at all. I don't understand.
Background check. How about that?
Yo, yo, yo. 1-4-8, 3-to-the-3, to-the-6, to-the-9.
Representing the ABQ. What up, beyotch?
Leave it at the tone.
Where the hell are you? Call me back.
Hey, Walt? Yeah?
Hank's about to deal. Okay, I'll be right there.
All right, let's see what the turn brings us.
You're looking good, Walt. Your color's better.
Yeah? Thanks.
He's actually on the pretty strong stuff now.
Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into taking some time off from work, but...
Well, actually, I just talked to Carmen this morning,
and they're getting a substitute for a few weeks.
Oh. Good for you.
I just didn't have a chance to tell you. Sorry.
Your bet, tough guy.
Check.
Yeah, check.
Check's in the mail.
Ten million. That's 25 million, blue's 10.
Well, then, 25 million, because that's how I roll.
Hey, Uncle Hank, um,
why were you arresting Mr. Archilleya the other day?
He's a pretty cool guy.
Well, turns out he has a record. Yeah, a couple of possession beefs.
We figured he was the guy that was stealing your school's chemistry gear.
I mean, you know, he had a key, fit the profile.
And when we searched his truck, we found a big old fat blunt.
Which goes to prove old huge Hugo ain't so cool after all.
It's to you, Walt. Yeah, I'll call.
You know, I can't believe the school system
didn't know about this guy's record.
I mean, that's pretty scary. How could something like that
just slip through the cracks?
I don't know.
I mean, for what it's worth, Hugo just doesn't strike me as a thief.
Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt, but you wouldn't know a criminal
if he was close enough to check you for a hernia.
That said, we got a search warrant, and we tore old Hugo's house apart.
Turns out he's a major-league pothead.
But he didn't raid your chemistry set.
You hiding something?
I'm in. And the river card.
Oh.
Yeah, I got nothing, I'm out.
I'm out.
Yowza.
When old holes-in-her-purse bails, you know you're in deep.
Looks like it's you and me, buddy.
What's gonna happen to him. Hugo?
Well, I mean, he's gonna lose his job, like he should.
Probably spend a couple months in county, because it's not his first rap.
I'm waiting.
You gonna man up or are you gonna puss out?
Hank.
What? Sorry.
I'm all in.
No, no, no. You bad, bad, bad, horrible liar.
What are you smoking there, huh?
You got a heart? You got the flush, don't you?
Nope. Not falling for it, buddy. I fold.
Talk about anticlimactic.
Hey.
Your cards couldn't have been that bad, come on.
Oh, my God. You threw away an ace?
What are you doing? And a cowboy for what?
Oh.
A handful of nothing.
Yeah, what up?
Who is this? I was dialing Jesse Pinkman.
Hey, man, he's out.
Well, where is he, then?
You the guy?
Yeah, I'm the guy.
How is he?
Got some busted ribs, and like that.
Got messed up pretty good.
I was all, like, "Damn, Tuco, chill, ese."
I don't know what got into him. Seriously.
Oh, he's out, man. Way out.
They got him doped up big time.
So you're the cook, huh?
Yo, I didn't catch your name.
Tell me about this Tuco.
Tell me everything about him.
Morning.
Could you pass the butter, please?
Badass, Dad.
Hey, cue ball. Need some directions?
You Tuco?
I want to talk to Tuco, and I'm not leaving until I do.
What's your name?
Heisenberg.
Heisenberg. Okay.
Have a seat, Heisenberg.
I don't imagine I'll be here very long.
No?
All right.
Be that way.
It's your meeting.
Why don't you start talking and tell me what you want?
Fifty thousand dollars.
Oh, man. Fifty G's? How you figure that?
Thirty-five for the pound of meth you stole,
and another fifteen for my partner's pain and suffering.
Partner.
Oh, yeah, I remember that little bitch.
So you must be Daddy.
Let me get this straight.
I steal your dope,
I beat the piss out of your mule boy,
and then you walk in here and you bring me more meth?
That's a brilliant plan, ese.
Brilliant.
You got one part of that wrong.
This is not meth.
Are you fucking nuts?
You wanna find out?
No, no, Gonzo, calma.
You got balls, I'll give you that.
All right, all right. I'll give you your money.
That crystal that your partner brought me,
it sold faster than 10-dollar ass in TJ.
Let's say you bring me another pound next week.
Money up front.
All right.
Money up front.
Sometimes you gotta rob to keep your riches.
Just as long as we got an understanding.
One pound is not gonna cut it. You have to take two.
Oh, really?
Hey, what is that shit?
Fulminated mercury,
and a little tweak of chemistry.

In closing, I can tell you
we take this very seriously. APD as well as the DEA.
Stopping the manufacture and sale of methamphetamines
remains one of our highest priorities.
And the theft of lab equipment from your school is also receiving our highest attention.
Rest assured, no stone will go unturned
in our search for the person or persons responsible for this.
If you have any questions, now would be the time. Sir.
You're talking like you haven't caught anybody yet.
What about the janitor that was dealing drugs at the school?
There is no indication that this individual was selling drugs.
He was arrested for having a small amount of marijuana
in his car, not in the school.
And he's since been fired.
I heard he had a record.
I'd like to know how he got a job here in the first place.
Exactly. Why wasn't there a background check?
There was one. We're currently reviewing our hiring policies.
You better be doing more than that.
This guy was arrested right in front of my daughter.
This guy was stealing lab equipment, right?
That's not our thinking this time.
We're looking at others who also had access, but not limited to the maintenance staff.
Are you saying there was a break-in?
Do we know exactly when this happened?
I mean, could it have been during school hours?
We haven't been able to establish a date or time. But there is no sign
of breaking or entering.
So whoever took it had a key.
We're talking inside job? Someone who's still at the school?
Sir, at this time I'm not able to discuss the details with you.
But what I can tell you is that we have some very good people working very hard on this case.
I'm sorry, officer, but that just sounds like double talk.
We're trying to protect our children. You have to level with us.
Really, we're giving you all the information we have.
You know what I'd like to see in this school? Drug-sniffing dogs.
Yeah. Dogs and metal detectors and locker searches and strip-searches.
Our district has strict policies...
I heard about this school up in Canada,
they arrested one of the groundskeepers with drugs,
and the next day they found out over half of the students were high on LSD.
LSD? When were you gonna tell us about the LSD?
No, please. No one said anything about LSD.
What about the equipment that was stolen?
The equipment was taken from our chemistry-department locker.
And tonight we're lucky enough to have someone here to give us some specifics.
Walt?
Yeah.
Mr. White is currently on medical leave.
But as he's chair of the science department,
he's made a very special effort to be with us here.
And I'd like to take a moment to thank him for that.
Could you please tell us more about the equipment that was taken?
Please.
Yes.
Sorry.
And thank you.
The inventory list for the missing lab-wear is as follows:
One 5000 milliliter round-bottom boiling flask.
One Kjeldahl-style recovery flask, 800 milliliters.
Two full-face respirators.
Some CEP funnels, some head with a thermometer holder.
Ooh. Ow. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Oh, wow.
Where did that come from? And why was it so damn good?
Because it was illegal.
The basement. Unfinished, of course.
But just look at all this space.
You gotta think rec room, media room.
Just imagine all the things you could do down here.
Now remember, you're buying for this fantastic neighborhood.
Big lawns and shade trees,
walking distance to the country club.
What happened there?
Bit of a fixer, but this house has great bones.
Know what? We're zeroing in.
I've got another listing, brand-new, right around the corner.
Yeah? Yeah.
Hi. Hi.
It's by appointment only.
Oh, well, I'm here to see the owner.
Oh. He's in the, uh, recreational vehicle.
Yo, it's appointment only.
How are you feeling?
About as good as you look.
Jeez, you look like Lex Luthor.
Listen, I visited you in the hospital, but you were asleep.
Yeah, Skinny Pete said you wanted Tuco's address.
Acting like you're all out for blood.
But you are alive. Obviously you wised up.
No, I did go see him.
Bullshit.
So, what, are you selling your house?
I got two dudes that turned into raspberry slushy and flushed down my toilet.
I can't even take a proper dump in there.
I mean, the whole damn house has gotta be haunted by now.
You didn't actually go see Tuco.
Here.
That is 17,500. Your half of the 35,000.
Plus, there's an extra 15 in there. It's all yours. You've earned it.
You got this money from Tuco?
Yeah. So Tuco gave you this,
is what you're saying.
Well, we made a deal.
You made a deal? That's right.
How...? Why would you make a deal with that scumbag?
You see what he did to me?
Because I think that we can do business together. We came to an understanding.
No way, man. Okay? No understanding.
Take a look at the money in your hand.
Now, just imagine making that every week.
That's right. Two pounds a week, 35,000 a pound.
Without even talking to me you told this insane ass-clown
dead-eyed killer that, uh...
That we would give him 2 pounds a week.
We'll just scale up our operation, we'll add a few more hours.
No, don't talk to me about hours.
What about pseudo, man? How are we gonna get that?
You think the meth fairy's just gonna bring it to us?
God, it takes me a week to get this stuff.
I'm driving all the way out to Las Cruces,
200 miles each way to meet up with my smurfs.
Smurfs? The dudes who go to the drugstores
and get a couple boxes at a time and then sell them to me.
And that's maybe only good for, like, maybe a half-pound worth.
See, that's the bottleneck in your brilliant business plan.
All right.
Of course, you would've known that if you would've just asked me.
Well, here we are again.
Here we are.
Skyler, you look great. Thank you.
You must be, what, six, seven months?
How goes it? It's great.
Um, other than waddling to the bathroom every five minutes.
The baby shower is next week.
And it'll be good to...
It'll be good to have a day that's just about Skyler.
Very nice.
Thank you. Thank you.
Well, Walt, I see you've committed to the hair loss.
Mm. Yeah.
How do you feel? Ah, okay.
L... You know, pretty decent, actually.
His color is better. You know, his energy.
And he's even more, um, physical.
More physical?
Ah, well, sexual.
Um...
Frisky, actually. I mean, that's gotta be a good sign, right?
Sure, I'll take that. Right, Walt?
Right.
Couldn't that mean that the chemo is working?
Well, realistically, it may just mean that we've got the antiemetics tuned right.
Truth is, until Walt's finished this round of chemo and we look at a new PET scan,
we just can't say for sure.
Well, isn't there anything else we could be doing?
I've been wondering about alternative medicine.
I mean, Eastern healing.
You know, holistic.
Well, I can't speak to its efficacy,
but as long as it doesn't interfere with our treatment,
anything that helps my patient have a better outlook,
a better comfort, is fine by me.
So you're saying it's just all psychological.
It doesn't make any real difference.
Having a better outlook can make a tremendous difference.
But it's also important that we manage our expectations.
What?
A junkyard? Let me guess, you picked this place?
What's wrong with it? It's private.
This is like a non-criminal's idea of a drug meet.
This is like, "Oh, I saw this in a movie. Ooh, look at me."
Yes. So where do you transact your business? Enlighten me.
I don't know, how about Taco Cabeza?
Half the deals I've ever done went down at Taco Cabeza.
Nice and public. Open 24 hours.
Nobody ever gets shot at Taco Cabeza.
Hell, why not the mall?
You know, wait at the Gap. "Hey, it's time for the meet."
You know, I'll put down the flat-front khakis,
head on over, grab an Orange Julius.
Skip the part where psycho-lunatic Tuco, you know,
comes and steals my drugs and leaves me bleeding to death.
Look, you don't have to be here for this.
Okay? I mean, seriously.
I'm okay.
No. I'm no pussy.
I'm good.
Mr. Clean and his boy.
Now, I'm sorry that I had to tune you up.
Respect, Ã©se, you gotta give it to get it.
Ahh.
Hey, what are we doing way the hell out here?
What, they close the mall or something?
Heisenberg, come on, break it out.
That's it? That's all you got?
We had some production problems.
0.53.
I thought you was a player.
You told me 2 pounds,
and now you waste my time with these Chiclets?
Seventeen and a half. Minus the half for wasting my time.
Hey, come on. What, you gonna argue?
You got something to say?
You're doing business like a couple little bitches.
I want all of it.
Seventy grand.
What did you say?
You like this product.
And you want more.
Consider it a capital investment.
Look, old, bald motherfucker.
Fifty-two and a half, 25 points vig.
Vig?
Interest, weekly.
Okay.
That's $65,625 with interest.
1.875 pounds.
No, 2 pounds.
Next Friday, and no production problems.
Can you handle 4 pounds?
Listen, old man, talk is talk.
But owing me money, that's bad.
What did you just do?
Four pounds. Four pounds. Two pounds wasn't bad enough.
We're talking 2, 300 boxes of sinus pills.
There ain't that many smurfs in the world.
We're not going to need pseudoephedrine.
We're gonna make phenylacetone in a tube furnace.
Then we're gonna use reductive amination to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds.
So no pseudo? No pseudo.
So you do have a plan.
Yeah, Mr. White.
Yeah, science.
Okay.
What's this? That is a shopping list.
Ah, getting some of those items may be challenging.
One autotransformer,
Six liters anhydrous methenamine.
Two 35 M and M tube furnaces.
It's mm, millimeter.
One 70 millimeter would be fine, but they're hard to come by, so...
Forty grams thorium nitrate.
Yo, Mr. White, I can't even pronounce half this shit.
No. You know what? Count me out. All right?
I'm leaving town. I'm moving to, like, Oregon or something.
This is just... Jesse, Jesse, Jesse. Listen to me.
Today is the first day of the rest of your life.
What are you doing?
This is the first day of the rest of your life. But what kind of life will it be, huh?
Will it be a life of fear, of "Oh, no, no, no. I can't do this."
Of never once believing in yourself?
Hm? I don't know.
Listen. These things? We need them, all right?
And only you can get them for us.
Okay, it's ready. Here you go.
Hi, baby. I'm your Aunt Marie.
Now, of course you already know that because when you watch this,
20 years from now, I will look exactly the same as I do now.
I know, it is amazing. I have aged shockingly well. Haven't I?
Anyway, welcome to your baby shower, Esmeralda.
Esmeralda?
Esmeralda. That's your name and you heard it here first.
Now, that is your wonderful, handsome older brother.
Show her, older brother, your face.
Okay, not right up the nose. Don't... Okay, not up it. Back. Back to me.
Here's your mommy. Hello, Mom.
And look, there you are, Esmeralda.
Yeah.
Wake up, baby. Time to party.
Okay. Easy, easy. Believe it or not,
Esmeralda, right after the party, your name was changed to Holly.
And I believe, Hank, that that was around the time.
That we took Aunt Marie to the insane asylum.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I dropped her off at the curb.
Then I married Shania Twain and lived happily ever after.
Ha, ha, ha.
There's Daddy. Speak, Daddy. Say hello to your daughter.
Oh, uh...
Holly, I am very proud of you.
And I... I think about you all the time.
Aww.
Wherever you go, whatever you do in life,
always know that you have a family who loves you very, very much.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Oh, my God, it's so cute. Oh, Carmen. It's...
Oh, look. Look at that. It's adorable.
I love it, Carmen. Thank you. You're so welcome, honey.
Thank you. Look at the little feet.
Okay. Oh. From me. And Hank.
Oh. What nice wrapping paper.
Marie always finds the best wrapping paper.
I do. Okay.
Let's see. And...
Exciting.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
It's... It's a...
A tiara. Yes.
Oh, wow! Oh.
Marie, is this...?
White gold and several carats worth of zircons.
Oh, Marie. You spent too much on this.
You shouldn't have. You really, really shouldn't.
But it's so... It's really... It's...
It's sparkly.
Sparkly. I know.
Thank you.
Hey, listen, Walt.
You got anything stronger than beer?
It's... It's great. I love it. Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you, sweetie, thank you.
Sorry, man. It's just, you know, after 200 presents, it just gets kind of old.
It's nice stuff. It is, isn't it?
I got just the thing to go with that.
I'm sorry, man, I wasn't thinking. No, no, no. It's okay.
You mind if I have one?
You think that's a good idea?
Hank, I've already got lung cancer.
Okay. You got me there.
Thanks.
Cuban.
Mm.
I did a little favor for an FBI guy.
Now, I was under the impression, ahem,
that these were illegal.
Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest, doesn't it?
It's funny, isn't it? How we draw that line.
Yeah.
What line is that?
Well, what's legal, what's illegal. You know, Cuban cigars, alcohol.
You know, if we were drinking this in 1930, we'd be breaking the law.
Another year, we'd be okay.
Mm. Who knows what will be legal next year.
You mean like pot?
Yeah. Like pot. Or whatever.
Cocaine? Heroin?
I'm just saying it's arbitrary.
Well, you ought to visit lockup.
You hear a lot of guys talking like that.
"Hey, man, what, you busting me with these 14 bales of ganja?
It's all gonna be legal next year when Willie Nelson's president."
Say it, buddy.
It don't only go one way either.
I mean, some other stuff is legal that shouldn't be.
I mean, frigging meth used to be legal.
Used to sell it over every counter at every pharmacy across America.
Thank God they came to their senses on that one, huh?
Yeah.
Okay.
Nice party. Mmm.
A tiara.
A white-gold tiara for a newborn baby.
Yeah. You know, I think she got that at Gertrude Zachary's in Knob Hill.
I mean, that thing must've cost, like, what, 5 or 600 dollars.
You know, I think I'm gonna return it.
Are you sure? She's bound to find out.
Well, maybe I can explain to her that we need a Diaper Genie
more than a white-gold baby tiara.
Hey. You know, I've been thinking
about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli about alternative medicine.
No. Don't worry. I'm not gonna mention that anymore.
No, no, no. What I mean is that maybe there is something to it.
Look. They do this Navajo sweat lodge up by Farmington.
Healing ceremony. It's supposed to be good for your lungs.
I'm not saying that I believe in it, but, uh...
Well, it might be an experience.
Really?
You?
In a sweat lodge.
Ah, I was thinking about driving up on Friday, coming back Sunday.
I mean, if you're okay with it. Well, of course I'm okay with that.
Okay.
Sweat lodge? Yeah.
I'm already sweating. Help me out.
Okay. Ow.
Hey.
Seventy millimeter tube furnace. Excellent. This is excellent.
Very good work. Damn straight.
Okay, hydrogen. Electrolytically produced, yes?
Yeah, like you asked. I mean, this...
This crap wasn't easy to get. And it's expensive.
Methylamine. Where's the methylamine?
I don't see the methylamine.
Yeah, well, that's where I ran into some trouble.
What kind of trouble?
Well, half this crap I could just buy, right?
But this methylamine...
Not so easy. I mean, they got it locked down tight.
But I did find some pros who will rip it off for us.
But they want 10 grand.
So, what's the problem? You have the money.
No, had. I spent almost the whole wad.
I mean, I got like 2 grand left.
I told you, all this crap was expensive.
So these thieves, did they say where they would be stealing it from?
A chemical supply place, south of town.
They got guards and security cameras. They got steel doors.
That's why these dudes are charging so much.
What?
Hmm.
So why don't we just steal it ourselves?
Yeah?
How we gonna do that?
With this.
So, what's this stuff called again?
Thermite.
And that will cut through a lock?
Because this is supposed to be one big-ass lock.
In World War II,
the Germans had an artillery piece... It's the biggest in the world.
Called the Gustav Gun.
And it weighed a thousand tons.
And the Gustav was capable of firing a 7-ton shell
and hitting a target, accurately, 23 miles away.
I mean, you could drop bombs on it every day for a month
without ever disabling it.
But drop a commando,
one man, with just a bag of this...
and he could melt right through 4 inches of solid steel
and destroy that gun forever.
Jeez.
So, yes,
I think it will cut through any lock we're likely to find.
You'd like to return this.
It's very nice, but yes.
Well, it... It is from this store, isn't it?
Oh, yes, it's from this store.
Do you happen to have a receipt?
No, I don't. It was a gift.
Aha. A gift. Mm-hm.
Mr. Wilson, could you step over here, please?
Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch this lady while I phone the police.
Whoa, excuse me?
Ma'am, this item is stolen, as I'm sure you know.
It... Come with me, please.
Oh, yes. I intend to press charges.
Please do.
We'll be here.
Look, I... I've never stolen anything in my life.
All right? I told you, that tiara was a gift...
A baby-shower gift.
So who gave it to you, then?
I don't think I have to tell you that.
Ma'am, you don't have to tell me anything.
You can talk to the police.
And I can tell them how my daughter-in-law remembers
showing this particular item to a tall blond woman
who, when her back was turned, walked right out the door with it.
So there. Oh, yeah?
Well, then, I can talk to the Channel Three News.
Yeah, I can tell them how you people, without a shred...
Without a modicum of evidence, illegally detained
an innocent pregnant woman in a dank storeroom.
This is my office. I feel I'm being held hostage.
Furthermore, I'm not getting enough air back here.
I don't think... I don't think I can breathe.
Oh, my... Oh, my God. Oh, no.
I'm going into labor. Yes, I... Oh!
Hi, you've reached Marie. Do the beep thing.
Marie, it's Skyler. I just left Zachary's.
I need to talk to you immediately.
Where is the guard? He's supposed to be coming by.
Do you think he already passed?
Look, I don't... I don't know.
Okay. Wait, there he is. There he is.
Yeah, yeah, I see him.
Okay, wait till he passes.
Okay, it's clear.
Here.
What the hell is this? It's all they had.
Then you go to another store. If this is all they had, you're in the wrong place.
Just put it on.
Should've... Of course.
Okay, okay.
Okay. This is it.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Get...
What?
Look.
What?
Hey, Jimmy, I'm stopping...
He's not supposed to come back. What's he doing?
Oh, my God.
Hope everything comes out all right.
He's going to the crapper. Oh, God.
Okay. You coming, man? Come on. What are you doing?
Okay, there it is.
Is this gonna be loud?
You'll find out in about 10 seconds.
Stand back.
Jesus.
Come on, come on.
Hey, what's going on?
Where are the gallon jugs? I don't...
God! What?
Let's just take this. Come on, come on.
What the...?
Damn it.
What the hell are you doing opening the door?
How are we gonna take this thing out?
Come on. Take that.
Lift.
God.
Jeez.
Hey. Somebody?
Billy, you back from the crapper yet?
Let me out of here.
I'm gonna kick somebody's ass. The alarm's going off. Check it out.
Billy? Billy?
Jimmy? Help!
Come on, man, let me try it. How is it gonna be any different?
Can I just try it? Fine, fine, go ahead.
Jesus. Okay.
All right.
Yeah, baby. See? Eat it. Okay, I'm the king.
Yeah, okay. I'm the king.
Oh, no. No, no, no. That didn't sound good.
Oh, God.
Well, this thing's not going anywhere.
We're not cooking in my damn driveway, I'll tell you that.
God.
What part of "slow it down" did you not understand?
What are you talking...? I'm... It's heavy, man. It got away from me.
Okay. All right. Now, that's good, that's good.
Now just bring it up, bring it up.
Easy, easy, easy. Okay.
Your real-estate agent, when is she supposed to come back?
Oh, shit.
Yeah. I don't know.
I'll make damn sure she doesn't.
Good call, yo.
Keep the temperature steady at 425 degrees.
We'll need to run it two more hours
to have enough to make 4.5 pounds.
Four and a half, not 4?
Two pounds pays, two go back.
Four and a half pounds puts us $44,000 ahead.
Each. Right on, man.
Right on.
With the amount of methylamine that we got last night,
we can make 4.5 pounds a week for...
Well, for the foreseeable future.
How long is, uh, that gonna be?
I mean, in your, uh, situation.
How much cash do you need?
More.
Someone's in the yard. Shh.
Yeah, this is definitely the one.
It's pretty.
Actually, I like it.
We could pull that out and put in a closet.
Just a little... We'll have to bring that down.
I thought you didn't like that type of thing.
Oh, no. No, I don't.
Right, right.
Shh. Shh.
Was there, by any chance, scheduled for this afternoon, an open house?
I left her a message, man. It's not my fault.
I don't care how you do it, just keep them out of here. Do you understand?
Yeah. All right, go.
Absolutely.
You know, you can't duck me forever.
What?
Come on, I left you like 15 messages.
When I went to your office, you snuck out the back way.
I didn't sneak. I was going to lunch.
Jeez, Skyler, what are you, the paranoid police?
You know what, Marie? Marie, I have never been so humiliated in my life.
That... Ahem.
That tiara.
They accused me, at Zachary's, of shoplifting it.
What were you doing at Zachary's?
I was returning it.
You were returning it.
Why would you return it?
It just wasn't...
Marie, what is wrong with you? Can you please tell me that?
Can you tell me why you'd do such a thing?
What does that mean? Does that mean you don't know?
That... means that I have no idea what the hell you're even talking about.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
The shop...
The shoplifting. No idea?
You're not going to admit this, are you?
I can't really admit to something
when I have no knowledge of what it is that I'm admitting.
Would you like that gift-wrapped?
Yes, actually.
Don't forget to sign in.
Thank you. Thank you.
You're right.
Look at this wall here.
Yo!
Excuse me, I'd just like to see the basement.
Yeah, well, it's occupied. It's not a bathroom.
Hey! I just want to see the basement.
What's the big deal?
You ain't seeing the basement, bitch.
You got that? Is that sinking in? Now, beat it.
All you all, house is not for sale.
Get the hell out!
Ahh.
Hey. Hey.
So how was it?
Was it an experience?
Yeah.
It was definitely an experience.
What's that smell?
Oh, yeah, it's...
sacred Navajo herbs.
You know.
Hey, everything okay?
No.
Not really.
Actually, not at all.
You know that tiara that Marie gave us?
Yeah. Well, she stole it. Yep.
I practically got arrested trying to return it at the store.
Oh, my God.
I mean, she refuses to admit it. She refuses to apologize.
I don't know what to do.
Hm.
People sometimes do things for their families.
People sometimes do things for their families?
And, what, that justifies stealing?
Well...
Wow. That must've been some sweat lodge.
Are you even listening to the words coming out of your mouth?
What would you do if it were me?
What do you mean, if it were you?
If it were me, what would you do? Would you divorce me?
Would you turn me in to the police?
You don't want to find out.
You want something to eat?
Um, no, thanks.
What is this shit? This is blue.
We used a different chemical process, but it is every bit as pure.
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.
Ah! Tight, tight, tight, yeah.
Blue, yellow, pink.
Whatever, man. Just keep bringing me that.
Ahh.
4.6.
Come on.
And what'd I say, man? This guy can cook.
You're all right, man. You're all right.
We're gonna make a lot of money together.
Just remember who you're working for.
What did you say?
I'm just saying, they gotta know that they're working for you.
Like they don't already know that?
Are you saying that they're stupid?
No, I'm just... I'm just saying.
Okay, so you're not saying that they're stupid.
So I don't understand. Are you saying that I'm stupid?
No, come on, Tuco. I'm just... I'm just saying.
No, you're just speaking for me!
Like I ain't got the goddamn sense to speak for myself!
Is that it? Is that what you're doing?
Tuco.
Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh?
Heisenberg says "relax."
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.
I'm relax...
Whoo! Damn, man! Look at that! Look!
Whew!
That is messed up.
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.

I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm rela--
Damn, man! Look at that! Look!
Yeah, that's messed up.
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.
Adjusting for inflation...
Good state college, adjusting for inflation...
...say, $45,000 a year.
Two kids, four years of college, $360,000.
Remaining mortgage on the home, 107,000.
Home equity line, 30,000. That's 137,000.
Cost of living, food, clothing, utilities...
...say, 2 grand a month.
I mean, that should put a dent in it, anyway.
Twenty-four K a year, provide for, say, 10 years.
That's $240,000. Plus 360, plus 137.
Seven thirty-seven.
Seven hundred and thirty-seven thousand. That's what I need.
That is what I need.
You and I both clear about 70 grand a week.
That's only 10 and half more weeks. Call it 11.
Eleven more drug deals, and always in a public place from now on.
It's doable. Definitely doable.
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.
Heisenberg!
What the hell? What's wrong with him?
What's the matter with you?
You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?
Oh, damn, Tuco.
Shut up!
There's no pulse.
Do something.
Do something?
He needs an ambulance. He needs a hospital.
Do something! You're smart, right?
Do that-- Do that thing.
No, there's not-- There's nothing.
Breathe into his mouth.
No, they don't teach that anymore. It doesn't work.
You, come here. Breathe into his mouth.
No.
Get rid of him.
Look, Tuco, we can't do him like that, man.
Buzzards and rats and all that.
I'm just saying, you know? It's not very Christian.
That sounds like arguing.
Gonzo, hurry up.
What's the big hurry?
Oh, I... I just think we're done here.
Oh, yeah?
You're done.
Hey, I'm back here.
Hello?
<i>Are already married--</i>
Hello?
<i>Thank you to our viewers--</i>
Hey.
<i>The crash happened as rush hour began around 8 a.m.</i>
Walt?
Didn't you hear me?
Walt.
Walt.
Hey.
Hey yourself.
What, you can't answer when I'm calling you?
Are you okay?
Great.
New hat?
Yeah.
I got some chicken at Albertson's.
Do you want me to heat some up for you?
<i>But they can occasionally adapt to other local areas...</i>
<i>...like airports, golf courses--</i>
Where've you been?
What is...?
What are you doing?
Okay.
You know what? I've got all this crap on my face.
Let me clean up first, okay?
You know, Walter Junior's gonna be home any minute, so...
Okay. Yeah, just...
Okay. Enough.
Hold up. Stop it.
Stop it!
I know you're scared...
...and you're angry and frustrated. And I know none of this is fair.
But you cannot take it out on me.
Hey, I'm home.
Oh, we are dead.
Dead, man.
<i>Ruto or rute or however the hell you--</i>
This is conjecture.
This is conjecture?
Conjecture isn't helping.
Conjecture--?
We need to state the facts.
Okay, fine. Facts, then. Fact A:
My phone rang eight times last night. Dead air, hang ups every time.
Second fact: Like 3 in the morning...
...I saw that Caddy of his cruising my neighbourhood.
If he wanted to kill us, he would've at the junkyard.
What is that, conjecture?
Are you basing that on that he's got a normal, healthy brain or something?
Did you not see him beat a dude to death for, like, nothing?
And that way-- That way he just kept staring at us...
...saying, "You're done."
"You're done"?
You know what that means? I will tell you what that means.
That means exactly how it sounds, yo.
All right. We are witnesses. We are loose ends.
Right now, Tuco's thinking, "Yeah, hey...
...they cook good meth, but can I trust them?"
What happens when he decides "no"?
No.
It is him or us. You understand? It is him or us!
How would you do it?
What do you mean, how?
Specifically, how would you do it? Step by step.
All right.
Say we set up one last sale.
This is providing he doesn't decide to waste us before then.
Every time we bring in a new batch, he always tests the product, right?
So as his head is down, you know, giving it a snort, just:
So three shots?
Three shots or, I don't know, two.
Wait, is it two, or is it three?
Two would probably work, I guess.
Okay, two shots.
Two in the chest, in the face?
I'm just trying to understand how this works.
Okay. All right, we'll put a pin in that.
But by now, the big guy, Gonzo...
...he's probably coming at you, right?
Yeah.
You turn toward him.
Yeah, just wheel on him--
How many shots for him? He's a big guy.
How many shots does that take?
I don't know. Three shots.
Three shots.
Okay, Tuco and Gonzo. Two men down.
Now, is there anyone else there?
I mean, Tuco is usually with someone else, right?
Maybe even a couple of guys. His dealers, his posse.
All right.
So we'll put a pin in that one too.
At this point, how many shots fired?
You've gotta be running low. How many bullets does that gun take?
It's not--
How can you suggest that we kill a man...
...and you can't even open the gun?
It's not that easy, is it?
Hey, man, Walt, you did it.
Yeah.
Call Skyler.
<i>Hey, there. You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>
<i>We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave us a message.</i>
Well, aren't you early bird, up and out already?
The big lug and I are gonna go try that new restaurant...
...over by UNM tonight...
...so let me know if you guys wanna hang.
Listen to me. "Hang."
Walt Jr. will be proud. I know the lingo.
I'm still hip.
It's Chinese. The restaurant.
I don't know, I just feel like Chinese.
Do you think that people in China ever just feel like American?
You know, and they go out and get little takeout boxes...
...with mashed potatoes and meat loaf...
...and try and figure out how to use the little knives and forks?
I wonder if that ever happens.
All right, I'll let you go. So call me.
Skyler didn't pick up?
Obviously she's not home.
Baby. Baby, wait up.
Hey, what was that about Chinese?
Dinner tonight. That new place.
How late they serve?
I don't know.
You got Dave at 8.
Not tonight.
Yeah, you do. Remember?
No, that's Thursday.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's Thursday.
Remember how at the last minute they changed it?
They were gonna charge us a penalty.
Look, baby, you only got six more sessions.
And I'm doing them, Hank.
I said I would do them, and I'm doing them.
I can't help it if you got your days of the week wrong.
Look out. Sorry, Mr. Schrader.
Look, it's... You know, it's just...
Oh, boy. I...
I think Dave is really helping you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
She's...
Hey! Hey, where's my phone call?
Hits two in the sand, two in the forest...
...and then he says, "Give me a four."
Hey, Gomez.
Gomez? What do you got for me?
Come on. Chop-chop.
Good morning to you too.
A.P.D. sent this over. This was about eight or 10 days ago.
You know Southwest Aniline, right?
Yeah, off the 25?
The place smells like feet.
This is them. Check this out.
Holy shit. What was that?
Thermite. So they tell me.
Burns about 5000 degrees.
Kind of stuff you see on a James Bond movie.
Nice. Guys who know their trade.
Wait. I take that back.
What, they didn't think about stealing a hand truck?
Hey, try rolling it, morons. It's a barrel.
It rolls. Jesus.
So, what'd they get?
Methylamine, 30 gallons.
P2P?
They're cooking old school biker meth.
Who the hell still does that?
All the old-timers I know are either dead or in prison.
Pseudo's in short supply...
...so these two make do by changing up the formula.
That and the thermite...
...I'd say these two know their chemistry.
But ranking them as burglars?
Shit.
I wouldn't trust these two to break into the Special Olympics.
They got book learning but no street skills.
Maybe they're college kids.
Chem students trying to make a big score.
Yeah, maybe.
I tell you, 30 gallons of precursor...
That big a score, they're gonna wind up stepping on some toes.
Tell you what, they better pray it's us who catches up to them...
...and not those boys from Juarez.
Your daughter wants out.
<i>Hey there. You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter Jr.</i>
<i>We can't come to the phone, so please leave us a message.</i>
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>
<i>Thought I'd try you earlier...</i>
<i>...before you go out and, you know, face the day.</i>
<i>I'm realising now...</i>
<i>...it probably takes you a little longer to get to the phone...</i>
<i>...owing to the extra baby weight--</i>
Hey, sweetie.
Walt, did you spend the entire night out here?
No.
No, no. Well, not all of it.
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of-- My stomach, you know.
I knew I was gonna be up and down, so I just didn't wanna wake you.
How would he know where I live?
You sure it was Tuco?
Who else could it be?
Did you ever tell him my name?
No.
Did you tell him where I live or anything?
No.
What about Gonzo, or the dead one?
Did you tell them anything?
I didn't say jack.
Okay, Tuco must've put out, like, you know, feelers.
He's got his ways and means, yo. Sources, all right? He's closing in.
And what happens when he finds out that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?
Oh, God. What happens then?
Look, it's got five bullets.
I finally figured out how to... Look, I just finally-- I figured it out.
I say we get a second gun, right? For you.
I mean, don't we, like, double our chances?
I mean, mathematically.
I've got a better idea.
Thank God.
All right.
What is it, Mr. White? Lay it on me.
Beans.
Beans?
They're castor beans.
So, what are we gonna do with them?
Are we just gonna grow a magic beanstalk?
Climb it and escape?
We are going to process them into ricin.
Rice and beans?
Ricin. It's an extremely effective poison.
It's toxic in small doses.
Also fairly easy to overlook during an autopsy.
All right.
All right. So--
Don't touch them.
You can get poisoned from beans?
Yes.
Back in the late '70s, ricin was used to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.
The KGB modified the tip of an umbrella...
...to inject a tiny pellet into the man's leg.
And we're talking about an amount not bigger than the head of a pin.
But it-- It killed him?
Oh, yes.
Now we just need to figure out a delivery device...
...and then no more Tuco.
Hey, Sky.
Hey, Hank.
How you doing?
Is this... This a bad time?
No, come on in.
I should've called first. I'm sorry.
What can I do for you?
Maybe we ought--
You wanna sit down first?
I don't know, Hank.
Depends on whether or not this is gonna be about Marie.
Did she send you?
Hell, no.
She's barely even talking to me.
That's why I'm here, okay?
Self-preservation. Big time.
Look...
...I know you gals have your ups and downs.
I get it.
Gals.
And I need to get involved like I need a second hole in my ass.
But if you could do me this huge favour and just return her phone calls.
I don't think I'm quite ready to do that yet.
Communication. Communication, right? Back and forth. Come on.
Sky, do this for me, please. You can yell at her.
Just call her back.
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.
That's right.
That baby tiara she gave me at the shower?
She stole it from Gertrude Zachary's. Yeah.
I almost got arrested when I went back to return it.
And Marie won't admit it. She won't apologise.
Yeah.
If I thought you were gonna return it, I would have never, you know...
You knew about this.
We're working on it.
I mean, she's got this therapist, Dave.
And I mean, Dave is really good.
Dave's good, yeah.
But it's an ongoing process, Sky...
...and we have gotta be understanding, you know?
I mean, we gotta, you know.
We gotta support the shit out of her.
Do we?
Yeah.
I need support.
Me.
The almost-40-year-old pregnant woman...
...with the surprise baby on the way.
And the husband with the lung cancer...
...who disappears for hours, and I don't know where he goes.
And he barely even speaks to me anymore.
With the moody son who does the same thing.
And the overdrawn checking account.
And the lukewarm water heater that leaks rusty-looking crap...
...and is rotting out the floor of the utility closet...
...and we can't even afford to fix it.
But, oh, I see.
Now I'm supposed to go, "Hank, please...
...what can I possibly do to further benefit...
...my spoiled, kleptomaniac, bitch sister...
...who somehow always manages to be the centre of attention?"
Because God knows she's the one with the really important problems.
Want me to take a look at that utility closet?
That's all it takes?
That's all it takes.
So now what?
Now we arrange our next meet.
In a public place this time. Nice and safe.
Business as usual.
And after we sell him our usual four pounds, then we'll pull this out.
"By the way, Tuco, this is a new formula we've been working on.
Care to try it?"
Okay, well, what's new about it?
I mean, just in case he asks. What do we say?
I don't know. Whatever you want.
It gets the user insanely high.
I mean, how much salesmanship do we really need?
That degenerate snorts anything he gets his hands on.
Okay, well, we'll just put a pin in that, then.
Anyway, within the next 48 hours, maybe 72...
...it'll look like natural causes.
What, like a heart attack?
Yeah.
Or the flu, maybe.
His associates won't know any differently...
...and we'll be in the clear.
Not if Tuco kills us first.
Just keep it down.
Hey, Hank. What's up?
<i>Oh, hey, buddy.</i>
You been home yet?
No. Why?
<i>Well...</i>
Because I really screwed up.
<i>I apologise in advance for the earful you're gonna hear from Skyler.</i>
<i>I was trying to get her and Marie talking again. Big mistake.</i>
<i>- I should have just kept out of it.
Yeah, well, okay.</i>
Me and my big mouth, I guess.
Yeah, well, that-- You know, it happens. It's no problem. No worries.
<i>Yeah, well, thanks, man. I appreciate that.</i>
Jesus, the wives, huh?
Hank, unfortunately, I really--
<i>Oh, yeah. Hey, man, don't let me keep you.</i>
Actually, I'm at work, so... Oh, hey.
You wanna see something really freaky?
<i>- Well, I would, but--
Seriously, Walt, this is...</i>
You gotta check out this crime scene me and Gomie are at. Just a second.
<i>Hank.</i>
Hang on. It should be coming through right now.
Guess it could be worse, huh? Could be having a day like these two.
<i>Couple of local bulletheads.</i>
Guess they pissed off the wrong guy.
<i>Walt, you there?</i>
<i>Hey, Walt?</i>
I'm taking this.
No. It's my gun. I need it!
No, you don't. Not if you leave town. Get out of here.
Tuco killing Gonzo means he's coming after us next. I've...
I've gotta get home. My family.
Skyler?
Walter, Jr.?
Skyler?
Hey.
Where's Walter, Jr.?
Having dinner at Louis' house. Supposedly.
Yep. All day, I've had the whole house to myself.
So where have you been this time?
Walt?
Walt?
Walt, will you come in here and talk to me please?
Walt!
I'll be right there.
Yeah, I recognise these two knobjobs.
Known associates of a psychotic piece of shit...
...named Tuco Salamanca.
Guess he got tired of associating.
Yeah.
Hey, do you mind if I get in there?
No, go ahead.
Thanks.
The big one smells fresher.
You guys find a death wound?
I see lots of blood, but no bullet holes.
Yeah. You done taking pictures?
All right. Let's lay them out flat.
Let me get out of your way here, man.
Snap.
Damn, Ricky. Leave something for the coroner.
Oh, this is beautiful.
Hey, someone call Jay Leno.
We got the world's dumbest criminal.
This guy wasn't murdered. Look.
Big stuff here was moving this guy's body...
...when the stack must have shifted.
Crushed his arm, pinned him here, and he bled out.
Poetic justice. Oh, I love it.
Don't you just?
Get a photo of me with this guy, all right?
Old stumpy, here. Make sure you get the stump in there.
Walt, would you talk to me, please?
I don't know where to begin.
What the hell are you doing here?
Get in.
Get in.
Let's go.
ï»¿1
All right, everybody. Listen up.
Tuco Salamanca. For those of you who were not with us this morning...
...we raided his headquarters.
Also his last-known address.
Even the little den of iniquity he keeps for his meth-hag girlfriend.
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants. The man himself smelled us coming.
So study the face. Study the file.
Get a big old raging hard-on...
...at the idea of catching this piece of shit.
My apologies to the H.R. department.
Grow tumescent with anticipation.
All right.
On the hit parade, 1998.
Reputed to have whacked one "Dog" Paulson...
...back when our bandidos were wresting the crank trade away...
...from the SoCal biker gangs.
Also, we're pretty sure he knifed a Mexican national in '03.
And for my money, seeing how he customarily deals with rivals...
...I'd say he is a prime suspect in the disappearance...
...of our dearly missed Krazy-8.
Hats over your heart for that dirtball.
We hauled Tuco in for questioning on that...
...but we couldn't make it stick.
Yeah, he runs a tight ship. Smug bastard.
And even worse, El Paso says he's got some kind of cartel connection.
Yeah, yeah. I know. We all know what's going on down there.
We sure don't want it going on up here...
...which brings us to the good news.
We finally got some actual, honest-to-God evidence.
This is one of Tuco's henchmen. Street name: No-Doze.
Found him tucked in the junkyard along with Tuco's own brother-in-law...
...a.k.a. Gonzo.
Gonzo, this rocket scientist, was moving No-Doze's body--
Either hiding it there or pulling it out. Not sure.
-when he got his arm crushed clean off.
Anyone wanna see the photos, they're on my website. Hilarious.
Anyway. The upshot is...
...we got us a nice, big, juicy, bloody fingerprint...
...which belongs to SeÃ±or Tuco.
Christmas came early to the Schrader household.
That is, provided we find this guy.
So to all present, I ask you, you wanna find this guy?
Yes.
Yes.
What the hell was that? Jesus.
Wanna try that again?
Do you wanna find this guy?
Yes!
Are we going to find this guy?
Yes!
Louder, damn it!
Yes!
Give me a "hell, yeah!"
Hell, yeah!
Hell, yeah!
Hell, yeah!
<i>Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah, Hell, yeah.</i>
They ain't gonna find him.
<i>Guy is in MÃ©xico by now.</i>
Appearances, Gomey. It's all about appearances.
Listen, I gotta take some personal time.
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?
Skyler called last night. It's Walt. He's missing.
Just disappeared from the house, and no one's heard from him since.
Damn. You don't think he...?
Holler if you need me.
All right. Thanks a lot, man. Appreciate that.
This is the most recent photo. We haven't taken many lately, so...
But that's what he looks like now.
Without the hair.
Hey, it's me.
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate you sparing us your day off.
No worries. Happy to help.
Yeah, this is helpful. Good.
What about height and weight?
Five eleven...
...most recently, about 170.
One sixty-five. That's what I weigh.
I guess he weighs a little less.
That's fine. That's close enough. Good.
What about other distinguishing features?
Tattoos or moles or scars?
Anything that might help us.
Tattoos? No. Not really. No.
That's fine.
Is that the list of medications?
Yes.
I wrote them all down. And there's no drug interactions.
None that are listed. I called his doctor, so, no.
Has he been depressed?
He's been withdrawn lately. A little withdrawn.
Yeah.
Last night, he was agitated.
Agitated?
Yeah. When he came home last night, he was agitated, upset.
Upset in general? Or upset because of something particular?
When I asked him what was wrong, he said:
"I don't know where to begin."
Then he just walked out of the room-- Out of the bathroom.
I was in the tub, taking a bath.
-and when I came out about 10 minutes later, he was gone.
Nothing else missing?
His keys, wallet, cell phone. Just what was on him.
But-- What about the phone call?
I'm looking into it.
What phone call?
Walt's cell phone rang.
He pulled it out, looked at it, and didn't answer it.
But then, a short time after, he wandered out of the bathroom.
I mean...
...couldn't that be...
...important, right?
Anything else you can think of?
Anything else.
No. I called the credit card providers...
...and there's no report of any recent activity.
I-- Let's see. I checked with every hospital within 50 miles.
Every police station. Every morgue.
So, no, I really don't-- I don't have anything else.
I was actually hoping that you had something else...
...being that you're the expert.
I'm sorry.
No worries.
I think this is good enough to start. Gives us plenty to work on.
Mrs. White.
Thank you.
Walter.
Thank you.
So that cell-phone call she's talking about? I ran it.
And?
Never happened.
No record of it.
Second cell phone.
Yeah. I'm thinking.
I understand.
Out.
Get away from me!
Settle down, bitch.
You gonna shoot me, huh? Shoot me in here!
I hope I bleed like a mother too!
That way, you have to clean it up!
It's your ride, retard.
I ain't gotta clean jack. Now, get out.
Get up.
Get up.
Oh, my God.
Don't do this, Tuco.
No more posters?
Walter Jr.'s making more.
Thank you, Marie.
I don't think he'll hurt himself.
I mean, he just doesn't strike me as the type.
He'll turn up.
Okay, the whole tiara thing...
...I just find it bewildering that...
Marie.
...you didn't believe that--
Marie.
Not now.
Empty your pockets.
Thought your name was Heisenberg...
..."Walter Hartwell White."
Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.
You know, a business name.
Yeah.
I like doing business with a family man.
There's always a lot of collateral.
Answer me one thing.
Can I trust you?
Yes. Yes, absolutely.
Sit down.
DEA...
...hit my place of business this morning.
About a hundred cops looking for me.
You two haven't been talking, right?
No.
No.
Picked up my whole crew, top to bottom.
Everybody except Gonzo.
That's weird, right?
I mean, don't you think that that's weird?
It's weird. Yes.
Unusual.
Unusual.
Last two days, I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.
He's been acting all pouty on account of No-Doze.
Explain to me.
How is it my fault that that little bitch did not know his place?
I saw this coming.
I can see the future, you know?
It's this gift that I have deep inside my head.
I knew last night they were gonna come try and bust me.
Gonzo.
He went and snitched to the cops! That lousy son of a bitch!
I trusted him like a brother! I was good to him! I was good!
I see Gonzo, I'm gonna gut him, I'm gonna skin him...
...and I'm gonna stuff his hide for a heavy bag...
...and every time I hit him, it's gonna be like a lesson to myself!
You never, never trust the people that you love!
So you plan to ice Gonzo, like, future tense?
What?
You're saying, Tuco...
You're saying that Gonzo...
...is currently operating as a police informant...
...as far as you know?
I'm very sorry to hear that.
That's disappointing.
Yeah.
I'd waste him too, yo.
Shut up.
Okay.
They're out there looking for me right now.
They got ghetto birds and black ops.
I need to get high. I need to get good and high.
What's with this gak? It smells like headcheese.
No, it's-- It's killer.
Yeah, seriously.
So I was thinking last night.
I came up with this great idea.
Mexico?
We'll disappear way out in the jungle.
We'll set you up in a superlab.
We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.
And no Federales are gonna mess with us...
...because I got my people there.
Connections.
We're going to make beaucoup bucks, Heisenberg, huh?
Tuco, I...
I have a wife and family.
So what? You'll get another one.
I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I can't just...
...uproot my life like that.
Yeah, man. I mean, me neither.
Who's talking to you?
You need me, man...
...because I cooked that scante in your hands.
Yeah.
I'll tell you something, yo.
You never tried nothing like it.
Stink or no stink...
...one bump, you'll be flying high for days.
It's a new product him and I've been working up.
Careful when you hit it.
It kicks like a 12 gauge when it comes on.
It's got a secret ingredient.
What secret ingredient?
Chilli powder.
I hate chilli powder.
This blue magic, this is money.
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.
We're gonna rewrite history with this.
All right. Time to clean the menudo out from between your ears.
No, no, no. No, I need him, Tuco.
I need him very, very badly.
He's my partner.
And if he doesn't go, I don't go.
I'll tell you this. My cousins are driving up here right now...
...to smuggle us back, and they're gonna be here by sunset...
...and you're gonna be on that truck, or you're gonna be dead!
And you...
You better hope they got room in the trunk.
Where are you going?
Louis is taking me to the train station.
We'll put these up.
No, no, honey. No, I'll do it.
He wants to help, let him help.
I mean, how long has it been since you've slept?
Yeah, she's right, Sky. Why don't you lay down a while?
For chrissake, you got a bun in the oven.
I got my cell if you need me.
Okay?
Okay.
Bye, sweetie. I'll see you later.
All right. Bye.
Actually, I think the very fact they haven't found him yet...
...bodes well.
Well, I mean, if he-- You know.
Somebody would've smelled something by now.
There's got to be something.
Some detail that we haven't picked up on.
What about the second cell phone?
Jesus.
What? We can't just ignore a potential clue, Hank.
Okay. What are you talking about?
The call you said Walt got before he disappeared?
There's no record of it with the phone company.
No incoming, no dropped calls, nothing.
But his phone rang. I heard it.
All right. Well, then if that's the case, he must have a second phone.
Why? What sense would there be in that?
Yeah. All right. Okay. I'm not here to argue with you.
No, Hank. You can't just bring up secret cell phone and then drop it.
What does it mean?
I don't know, Sky. What do you want me to say?
It means Walt has a secret.
Everyone's got one from somebody, big or little.
Okay. Everyone. Okay.
Skyler, come on.
He kept cancer from you for weeks.
Okay, then, let's assume there's a second cell phone.
So what? What, is he having an affair?
Walt? Please.
What about the marijuana?
He's not on pot anymore.
Says who? Him?
Chemotherapy and marijuana go together...
...like apple pie and Chevrolet.
Maybe he's addicted to the pot...
...and he owes his drug dealer a lot of money.
Marie, you don't get hooked on pot like that.
How do you know? You didn't even know he had a second cell phone.
Hank, you have to question this drug-dealer person.
He may know something.
Well, I'm telling you, we're grasping at straws here.
Then grasp.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Hi, I'm looking for Jesse. He around?
No. I'm afraid not.
Why?
I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse about my brother-in-law, Walter White.
He taught your son chemistry in high school.
Oh, Mr. White. Yes, I remember him.
That was a long time ago.
Yes, ma'am.
It's my understanding that he and Jesse, they've stayed in touch.
Really?
Yeah.
Mr. White must've seen some potential in Jesse.
He really tried to motivate him.
He was one of the few teachers who cared.
Yeah, Walt's that way. He's a good man.
I'm so sorry to hear about his illness.
Please pass along our best wishes.
I certainly will, as soon as he turns up.
He's missing, actually.
Just kind of walked off, or...
Anyway, which is why I'm going around...
...trying to think of anyone who knows him, even slightly.
That's terrible.
Anything we can do to help.
Well, if you could put me in touch with your son...
Like I said, we're kind of desperate for leads.
Jesse's not answering either number, and no one seems to be at his house.
And why do you think my son and Mr. White would be in touch?
I don't necessarily. I just--
Are you with the police?
No, ma'am. Not at all.
I'm with the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Oh, my God.
Is my son in trouble?
I have absolutely no reason to think that, no.
Do I need to get a lawyer?
You know, you don't seem very forthright about this...
...coming here and asking questions about my son and--
Mrs. Pinkman, I'm not here on official capacity.
I do not care what your son may or may not have done wrong.
I just wanna find my brother-in-law.
His wife is worried sick, and she's got a baby on the way.
I'm sorry. I would like to help you...
...but I have not seen my son in over a month.
I don't expect to see him anytime soon.
Well, thanks for your time.
If you could tell me one more thing.
Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy Monte Carlo, as far as you know?
If he had spent half as much time and money on his education...
...as he has on that ridiculous bouncing car...
Low rider, huh?
Gomey, hey.
No, nothing yet. Hey, listen, do me a solid and check out...
...a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo...
...registered to a one Jesse Pinkman.
Specifically, I wanna know if the car's got a LoJack.
It's one of those jack-off low riders, so I'm betting there is.
If so, can you go ahead and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.
Chilli powder.
Did I not already tell you how moronic that was?
Whatever, man.
At least I tried something.
Hey, it almost worked too.
How's about you leaving my gun, huh?
First you boost it, then you leave it in your house.
My gun.
How was I supposed to know you were chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?
Well, at least he wants you alive.
Hey, I don't get it.
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo, then who did?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Does it really matter?
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead and not a police informant...
...who does he automatically blame?
Us.
We need a plan.
Think, think.
Let's just bum-rush him, man.
You crack him over the head with something...
...and I'll go for his gun.
Crack him over the head with something?
Hey, you got the C-bomb, man, all right?
You're as good as checked out already.
Okay? You should be, like, all sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.
Just...
Oh, so my life is not the priority here...
...because I'm gonna be dead soon anyway.
That's your point?
Yeah.
We gotta get him to take this.
Well, he don't much like the taste of chilli P.
That much has been established.
So unless you can convince him to booty bump...
Eat. We got a long ride ahead of us.
Go on, sit. You're looking a little weak, Heisenberg.
I don't want you to go belly up before we get there.
<i>Take it easy, Tio.</i>
I will feed you. I eat first. That's the deal.
What?
I get it, I get it, I get it.
Oh, you greedy old bastard.
I tell you, Heisenberg.
Old people.
You feed them, huh?
You put them in a really nice crib in the country...
...and yet they gotta steal the food off your plate.
You better eat every bite of that.
What did you do that for?
God!
Hey, look. Look.
There's nothing left.
What? What do you want?
No.
Don't even tell me that you're hungry.
Don't go there.
<i>Are you mad-dogging them, Tio?</i>
What, you don't like them?
One ding.
<i>That means yes. Tio don't like you.</i>
<i>Why don't you like them, Tio?</i>
You don't trust them?
<i>- Why don't you trust them, Tio?
Tuco, come on. He's...</i>
There clearly some dementia. He's not lucid.
<i>Did they do something to you, Tio?</i>
Something that you don't like?
<i>What did they do to you? What did you do to my tio?</i>
Nothing. Nothing.
<i>- Bullshit! My tio does not lie!
I don't know. I swear. I don't know.</i>
No, I-- Maybe it was-- I did change the channel on his TV, but...
Yeah, that's it. While you were cooking...
...he was watching one of those telenovels...
...with all those ripe honeys on it. He was really into it.
I told you not to change the channel.
You know, dude needs his eye candy. That's it.
<i>Is that it, Tio?</i>
<i>Is that it, Tio?</i>
Did they change your mamitas?
<i>What are you telling me, Tio?</i>
Are they punking me?
Hey. No.
No, man. No.
Come here!
No.
No, no, Tuco.
Tuco, no. Tuco.
Shut up!
No. Please, no. God. Please, no.
No, God. I don't wanna die.
Tell me what you did, Walter!
Jesus, I don't wanna die.
No!
Tell me what you did!
We tried to poison you.
We tried to poison you...
...because you're an insane, degenerate piece of filth...
...and you deserve to die.
Who's the bitch now?
Let him bleed.
The keys.
Tuco.
Oh, my God.
The cousins?
What the hell is going on?
Jesse Pinkman.
You're a hard man to find.
Oh, shit.
Easy.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God. Hank.
Who?
Hank.
What?
Oh, my God.
What?
Oh, my God.
Stay. What are you doing?
ï»¿1
Okay. That's okay.
Get that.
Hey.
Oh, God. Please.
Oh, jeez.
Please.
Please.
It's a bold plan, Mr. White.
You sure this is the way to go?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You see that?
What does he remember?
Not a whole lot.
He came in dehydrated and disoriented...
...but once we gave him fluids he stabilised pretty quickly.
But I mean...
He knows where he is?
Oh, yes, yes. Absolutely.
It's only the last day or so that seem to be missing.
Go on in. He's probably awake.
My God.
Walter.
I'm so sorry.
Come here.
You know who I am, right?
Yes, son. I know who you are.
Come here. Give your old man a hug.
It's so good to see you.
How do you feel?
Better.
Yeah. I...
I feel like myself.
Really, I mean, in...
The past couple days are missing, but other than that...
...I feel fine.
My God, Walt.
What a day this has been.
So, Uncle Hank, he was in a shootout?
A shootout?
He killed some guy. Some big drug dealer.
Uncle Hank wasted him.
Oh, my God. Is he all right?
Absolutely fine.
Where did this happen? How could--?
Walt, everything's okay.
We're all okay.
We'll be all right.
<i>And no idea what caused it?</i>
No.
But they're gonna run a whole series of tests, so...
<i>But what could it be? I mean, did they give you a worst-case scenario?</i>
I really...
You know, there's no point in getting ahead of ourselves, so...
Well, which supermarket?
Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain?
<i>- Marie.
I... Don't get me wrong.</i>
I think it's just great that, you know, he's back and he's feeling better.
I just, I mean...
He... Naked?
He was naked.
Naked.
In a supermarket.
It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?
<i>In any case, I'm gonna get over there as soon as I can.</i>
No, no. Don't worry about it right now, Marie.
How's Hank?
You know, I ran over here and I got to see him all of...
...30 seconds before they yanked him away.
You know, you'd think today of all days...
...they'd let him go home on time.
But how is he? Really?
Hank?
He's indestructible, you know that.
I identified myself and told the suspect to show his hands, turn and face me.
At this point, I identified the suspect as Mr. Salamanca...
...and observed what appeared to be a gunshot wound in his midsection.
He was shot previous to your arrival?
Yes, sir.
Again I instructed him to show his hands.
Mr. Salamanca lunged toward the vehicle...
...and fired on me with what I ascertained to be an M16 assault rifle.
I returned fire and sought cover...
...as Mr. Salamanca proceeded to engage me.
When he paused to reload...
...I was able to take an effective shot.
Agent Schrader...
...what were you doing in a shooting fight on your own, with no backup?
Mr. Salamanca's presence was not something I'd anticipated.
I was tending to another matter.
What other matter?
An unrelated family matter.
Searching for your brother-in-law, as I understand.
Your brother-in-law?
Yes, sir. He's since been found.
He's fine. The whole thing was a misunderstanding.
At the time, he'd been missing for hours...
...and since he's in poor health, the whole family was concerned.
I was talking to his acquaintances...
...trying to get a fix on his whereabouts.
The Monte Carlo at the scene belonged to a former student of his...
...a Jesse Pinkman.
I was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car when I came across Mr. Salamanca.
And what about this Pinkman? What was his car doing at the crime scene?
Have you run him down yet?
Not yet, but we're working on it.
Man, they're like Jehovah's Witnesses.
They don't give up.
I don't get it. Why don't they kick your door down?
They need probable cause.
Probable cause?
Yo, what did you do? Rob a bank?
I told you, this is serious shit.
I'm like an outlaw.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Holy Christ!
You're Willy Wonka.
You are Willy Wonka, and I got the golden ticket.
Put me on your magical boat, man.
Sail me down your chocolaty river of meth.
So where you keep the pseudo?
It's a P2P cook. That barrel? Aqueous methylamine.
With that, you don't need pseudo. Come on, help me out, man.
No pseudo?
Come to me, beautiful baby. I'm gonna be so good to you.
Oh, my God. Just take this, here.
But I can't just let you break this down.
That'd be sacrilege.
I told you, that's why we're here.
You saw the cops. Right?
Sure.
But couldn't we just cook one quick batch?
You know, for the road?
No, forget it, all right?
This stuff has to go, like, now.
Dude, you owe me.
I mean, we're cool, but I ain't forgetting you just left me stranded.
God, Badger!
Don't mess with me.
Got it?
Yeah, I got it.
Oh, my God.
Okay, that's all of it.
This was a bad choice.
You sure about this guy?
He's totally, totally cool.
He's my cousin.
Yo, what'd we say, 500?
We didn't say, and it's 1000.
Thousand bucks?
Come on, where you towing it, man, Seattle?
It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.
Look, I mean, all I got on me is...
...560.
You know what?
Hey-- No--
Clovis, he'll pay you the rest later.
He's totally good for it. Jesse's a stand-up dude.
That right? You a stand-up dude?
Yeah, I am.
I will get you the other 500.
Five hundred more.
Your word's your bond, right?
Right.
I saved your skinny ass, yo. I totally vouched for you.
What are you doing now, exactly?
I'm giving you, like, two hours...
...and then I'm calling on a pay phone, not a cell phone.
You're not using your own name.
I mean, obviously. Look, dude, I'll do, like, what you said, but why?
Why do you gotta go and do this?
They need probable cause.
I'm giving it to them.
What's the last thing you remember?
Well, I was driving home.
I think.
And...
Do you remember coming home?
You came in, and I asked why you were out of breath?
You don't remember talking to me when I was in the bathtub?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Nothing else? No fleeting images?
Well, no. I...
I was--
I was walking down some road or highway...
...with a lot of headlights...
...and I remember feeling fear.
That's it.
All right. Thank you.
Well, there's definitely some good news here.
The MRI shows no metastases.
Meaning the cancer hasn't spread to the brain?
Yeah, we're looking really good.
Oh, thank God.
So, what was it, then?
There's no sign of stroke or seizure.
And considering your condition...
...the blood panel looks good.
Then what are we talking about? What happened?
As of right now, we really...
...can't say.
Forgive me. Granted, this is not my field...
...but isn't it possible that this had something to do...
...with all the prescriptions I've been taking?
There's the antiemetic...
...the antitussive...
...the this, the that. Not to mention the chemo itself.
And being off all of them for the past few days, I have to say...
...I'm feeling much better.
Yeah, and, you know, when we pick up these medications...
...the information sheets are as long as your arm.
I mean, it's page after page of side effects and warnings.
Right, exactly. Could it be that simple?
Well, we'll take another look at that, sure.
Walt, I understand that you've been kind of stressed out lately.
Stressed out? I--
No, I don't think I'm--
Walt, please.
Stressed out is putting it...
...mildly.
Well, I guess I've had a lot on my mind lately, but as I've said...
...I'm feeling much better.
Shouldn't we be talking about when I can get out of here?
Well, that may still be a ways down the road.
A ways down the road?
Actually, I think our next move is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.
Now, is that absolutely necessary?
Nobody likes being in the hospital. I get that.
But until we know what caused this incident...
...we can't be certain it won't recur.
That your last hit?
Yeah.
Finish it quick.
Show your hands. Get on your stomach now.
Get on your stomach now! Get over. Roll! Do it now!
I'm going, I'm going.
What's going on?
What did I do?
Jesse Pinkman, I presume.
What, man?
Tell me again.
Again?
What's there to tell, okay? Her and I were partying, that's it.
Since Saturday night? Partying for three days straight.
Just bumping uglies and smoking that crystal you got from your pal, Tuco?
Taco? I don't know any Taco...
...and I damn sure didn't say anything about no crystal.
Three days, you must have got hungry.
Yeah, I guess.
You order take-out?
Yeah.
Yeah, where from?
You get yourself a little of that moo goo gai pan...
...from that chink place around the corner?
No, no, we didn't. We got stuff from the vending machine.
You know, Funyuns.
I had a Hot Pocket.
Funyuns and Hot Pockets?
You didn't notice your car was gone?
No, not until you guys went and busted down the door.
Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh?
Management's gonna be on my ass for sure.
You weren't answering your phone.
It was in my car.
That right?
Yeah.
We found your car...
...but your phone wasn't in it.
You found my car?
You found my car?
Awesome. DEA all the way. Yes.
Since we're talking about missing property, did you...?
Did you leave anything else in the car?
Like what?
Like what? Like...
I don't know. Like this?
Sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred and 20 dollars.
That's not mine.
That's not yours?
He says it's not his, Gomie.
Gee, I really thought this might be yours.
I wish.
Unclaimed drug money, huh? Nice.
You know what we got here, Gomie, don't you?
That's a new interdiction van right there, yeah.
Definitely new softball jerseys, because we need them.
Good thing Tuco's already dead.
I lost this kind of money, I'd wanna kill myself.
So who's your chief, little Injun?
What?
What does that even mean?
I think your story's bullshit.
I think you know who Tuco Salamanca was.
Your car was there because you were there.
Tuco had a bullet in him when I got there and you know about that too.
So, what are you saying?
I shot someone?
With, like, a gun?
You?
No.
Only shooting you do is into a Kleenex.
But I think you know the badass who did.
Look, I was partying with Wendy, okay?
Funyuns and boom-boom.
No.
I don't think so.
Tell you what. We're gonna...
...go talk to that skinny yeast factory of a girlfriend you got.
And you know what?
I got a feeling she's gonna, you know, roll on you.
Don't go nowhere.
Where's my root beer? Come on. I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.
I got medical issues.
Medical issues?
Like, what kind of medical issues?
You got penis withdrawal?
You got schlongus interruptus?
Wendy, listen. Talk to me...
...and you get a root beer and a tinkle.
Tell me the last three days.
I told you...
...we were shacked up since Saturday.
Neither of you left the room? Not even for a little, little minute?
Not even for a second?
For a second? I don't know, maybe.
Maybe?
Did Jesse leave the room?
He did, didn't he?
Wendy, you can do it. You can do it, Wendy.
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.
You know you wanna go back to giving windys, Wendy.
It's you. I know you.
You're the one in the black truck. You wanted me to do that kid.
What?
The kid with the crutches.
The football player.
How about we stay on topic?
Look, Jesse came over to the palace at 11:00 Saturday night.
We were together the whole time, and he never left the room.
And that's all I'm saying about that.
Now, come on.
Where's my root beer?
You wanted her to bang a football player, pervert?
It's a long story, Gomie.
I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it, but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.
Not yet. I got one more shot at that little skid mark.
And how are you sleeping?
Fine. Most nights.
Good.
Have you noticed any recurring thoughts or images...
...things you can't get out of your head?
How about feelings of guilt or persecution?
No. Look, doctor, I don't mean to be rude...
...but where is this going, exactly?
We're starting a process, Walt. An ongoing process.
Do you prefer Walt or Walter?
Ongoing for how long?
I just met you. Hard to say.
We could be talking about days, weeks, months.
Look, doctor, I feel fine, really.
Now...
...if this is truly necessary, can't I continue as an outpatient?
Walt...
...a fugue state is a very serious event.
What if you were to disassociate while driving?
Get into a situation...
...where you could be shot by the police?
We can't allow you to leave...
...until we're certain what happened was a non-recurring event.
Saying you feel fine doesn't solve this.
Would you tell me about patient confidentiality?
It's very straightforward.
Without your permission, I can't disclose anything to anyone.
What about my family?
Not your family, not to the police. Not to anyone.
The exception would be if you threatened to kill someone.
Then I'd be able to tell that person, but only that person.
And you, as a medical practitioner...
...you abide by these strictures absolutely.
Yes.
All right.
There was no fugue state.
I remember everything.
The truth is...
...I couldn't stand to spend another second in that house.
I just had to get out...
...and so I left.
I didn't think about it. I just did it.
I walked for a long time, and when I couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.
I got as far as Gallup...
...and then it was just time to come home.
So...
...being found naked in a supermarket...
...that was your way of giving credibility to a lie?
Of avoiding questions about your disappearance?
Why run away?
What did you feel you had to run from?
Doctor, my wife is seven months pregnant...
...with a baby we didn't intend.
My 15-year-old son has cerebral palsy.
I am an extremely overqualified high school chemistry teacher.
When I can work, I make $43,700 per year.
I have watched all of my colleagues...
...and friends surpass me in every way imaginable...
...and within 18 months, I will be dead.
And you ask why I ran?
Gomie, you wanna do the honours?
What's that mean?
That means yes.
Yes is a bell, no is no bell.
Come on, this is bullshit.
I mean, look at this dude. He doesn't even know what planet he's living on.
SeÃ±or...
...are we on the planet Mars?
Are we on the planet Saturn?
Are we on the planet Earth?
SeÃ±or, is today Friday?
Is today Monday?
Is today Tuesday?
Okay, seems like he's all there. Let's go for it.
SeÃ±or...
...was this man at your house yesterday?
SeÃ±or, was this man at your house yesterday?
This guy right here, he was at your house, right?
Was he doing business with your nephew Tuco?
SeÃ±or, are you scared of this man?
No, he's not scared.
Come on, Granddad.
Don't you wanna help us out?
Oh, man.
I guess that's a no.
I told you, numbnuts. This guy's OG.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Kept his mouth shut for 17 years in San Quentin.
Stroke or no stroke, old-school gangbang Mexicans don't help feds.
All right. It was worth a try at least.
We gotta kick Pinkman loose.
It's all right. He's nobody anyway.
You telling me you buy that lame-ass story?
I buy that lame-ass story more than I buy he had anything to do...
...with shooting Tuco, man.
Dad? Hey, Dad.
Hey, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. Hey, I'm...
What's--?
She did? No, I didn't get any messages.
You know, I actually...
...lost my phone, and I've been too busy to get a new one.
I've been busy as...
As totally productive.
Hey, you know what? I'm actually zeroing in on a job.
Yeah, yeah, data entry, like we talked about.
Yeah, I'm totally amped.
Hey, could you give me a ride?
I'm actually-- I'm downtown and my car's in the...
Oh, no. Yeah, hey, that's cool. I will--
I'll call you later when you have some...
Okay. Yeah. No. I--
I get it. I get it.
Okay, bye.
Thanks.
So, what are you doing now?
Waffle House?
Waffle House is good.
Pay phone?
Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere, nobody followed.
So how did it go?
Okay. You?
They sweated me plenty, but they finally cut me loose.
So you getting out of there?
Tomorrow.
So who came for you?
The DEA? What did they ask you?
Yeah, that's the thing, you know. Your scumbag brother-in-law...
...took my rainy-day fund.
<i>Your what? What is that?</i>
My rainy-day fund. Sixty-eight thousand, okay?
Cue-ball son of a bitch laughed in my face.
Now I got like 80 bucks to my name.
Wait, wait. What does he know?
Does he know it's your money?
No, man. He doesn't know shit, okay?
The plan worked.
They bought it.
I got bills due, man. I'm screwed.
<i>- Did he mention my name?
No. Thanks for caring.</i>
What about the basement?
It's clean.
<i>And the RV?</i>
Badger's cousin took it to his garage. It's safe.
Can he get it running again?
<i>- Why?
So we can cook.</i>
So you still wanna cook?
Seriously?
What's changed, Jesse?
Seven-hundred thirty-seven thousand.
Twenty-one pounds...
...minus cash on hand...
Cash on hand.
Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?
No, I was awake.
Want some cornflakes?
Yeah, sure.
You okay?
Yeah.
Southwest Aniline again?
What's this?
It's the blue meth we found up by your late homey.
Tuco wasn't my homey, any more than Charlie Manson was yours.
Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style.
P2P, huh?
So, what are you thinking?
The two stooges over here cooked it?
Lab said that blue meth's the purest they've seen.
At least since this.
Krazy-8.
Yeah.
Krazy-8, Tuco...
Somehow, some way, it's all connected.
A simple explanation...
...only I'm not seeing it, and it's making my head hurt.
That's because you're working that ugly melon too hard.
It's dead around here. Let's get a couple of beers.
It's 11 in the morning.
I'm buying.
You're buying? Holy crap.
What, is it Cinco de Mayo already?
Oh, yeah.
Surprise.
You little sneaky bastard, you.
Very nice work.
Thank you, sir.
What's this?
Look what we got you.
Look at that, I love it.
They got the gut right.
Hey.
There you go.
Hey, thanks, man.
Thank you.
We all got you a little something, and this is from all of us.
You shouldn't have.
Oh, you sick, sick puppies.
I love it.
You going to finish your apple juice?
No, thanks, buddy. You take it.
You're supposed to drink it.
The nurse said you have to stay hydrated.
But I'm not thirsty.
Dad. Drink it.
Hey.
Better late than never, huh?
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing, buddy? You all right?
I see the mark of the beast there, huh?
Oh, yeah. Marie stopped by this morning.
They really cheer the place up.
Hey, I ran into Sky downstairs.
They're rounding up a wheelchair for you, you freeloading bastard.
So tell us about the shootout.
I was, you know, just doing my job.
Whole thing was over in about five seconds.
Say, Walt, you know...
...how are you?
I'm okay.
Really, I'm feeling fine.
Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah.
The doctor is calling it a...
An isolated episode of transient global amnesia.
Damn.
Which means non-recurring.
Non-recurring. That sounds good, yeah.
Sounds real good.
I'll tell you what, I'm glad you're back. You really gave us a scare.
Listen, Hank.
I don't know what to say. I mean...
...you going out there looking for me put you in danger, and I'm so...
Sorry, sorry doesn't even cut it. Not nearly.
No, no, no. Is that what you're worried about? Forget it.
Look, the office, they're treating me like I'm Eliot Ness, okay?
They threw me a party, the gals baked me a chocolate-chip cake...
...like you wouldn't believe, okay?
You ought to disappear more often.
Just kidding. Don't do that.
Hey, look. Look what they gave me.
Look what they gave me.
What is it?
That, gentlemen, is the grill of the guy I shot.
His grill?
Yeah.
It kind of goes over the front teeth like that, you know?
Sort of a fashion statement, I guess.
You know, certain folks are attracted to shiny things.
Wow, cool.
Yeah.
I can't tell you how good it feels to be home.
I'll get these in the wash.
Okay.
Say, honey, I...
I was just thinking about going out to 7-Eleven. Do you need anything?
Big Gulp? Slim Jim?
Skyler, listen to me.
This will not happen again, okay?
I won't let it.
I'm still here. I'm me...
...and we're gonna be okay.
Walt...
...do you have a second cell phone?
A second cell phone?
The night you disappeared, you came in when I was taking a bath...
...and you were very upset.
It was like something terrible had happened.
And then your cell phone rang.
I saw you check the number, and then you got up...
...and just disappeared.
Yeah.
And when Hank checked your phone records...
...there was no call.
No call on the phone I know about.
That is...
...odd.
I mean, I don't remember any of that...
...but one thing I am sure of is that I don't have a second cell phone.
Okay.
ï»¿1
Hey, Captain America.
What's up, brother?
Hey, bro.
This is stupid.
You got a better idea?
Okay, fun. Whatever.
So when do we, you know?
We don't, for now.
No cooking until things settle down.
Settle down? I thought you're the one that said nothing's changed.
Look, I just put my family through an ordeal...
...that they're just now starting to accept, okay? I can't--
That's too expensive.
Look, I can't leave my house...
...for more than 20 minutes without my wife worrying.
I need time to mend fences.
Okay, so while you're fixing fences, what about me, huh?
Your A-hole brother-in-law took all my money.
That's $600.
Okay, what about the rest?
Rest of what?
Half your money's mine.
Fifty-fifty partners. That's our business motto.
Meaning what, exactly? That I suffer for your carelessness?
You're the one who wanted to work with Tuco.
Okay. If it weren't for that, none of this would've happened.
Just be cool. We'll talk about this later, okay?
As for now, no contact. Understood?
Where are you going?
I leave first.
Walt!
In the kitchen.
Hey.
Hey. I didn't know you were allowed to touch the stove.
Hilarious, Groucho. Go on, grab a seat.
Juice is on the table.
What?
Good morning, honey.
Hey, Mom.
Dad's cooking breakfast.
But don't worry. I'm also doing all the dishes.
Nice? Follow me.
There's also orange juice and grapefruit juice...
...which, personally, as you know, I've never been a fan of.
But considering all the polyphenols and the limonoids, can't hurt.
Walt, you didn't have to do this.
I wanted to.
Grapefruit juice?
Yes, please. Thanks.
There you go. Honey?
No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.
All right. Dig in, dig in. Pancakes are not getting hotter.
Yeah.
There you go.
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.
No.
Yes, absolutely.
No, in terms of pure musicianship...
...I would put them up against any current band you can name.
You wouldn't know any current bands.
That's besides the point.
Have a good day, honey.
You too.
Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
Boz Scaggs.
Whoever they are. Bye. Thanks for breakfast.
Bye.
You're welcome.
Tell Louis to drive carefully.
All right.
Our son doesn't know who Boz Scaggs is.
We have failed as parents.
Come to think of it...
...I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.
Stop it.
Give me your plate. No, no. I'll get it. I'll get it. Yeah.
Thank you.
Hey, listen...
...in the calendar section...
...all week long...
...there's a fiction writer's seminar at UNM.
And, you know, probably talking about how to get published...
...and that sort of thing.
Yeah?
Yeah, so, anyway, I thought maybe you might...
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.
Oh, and...
...you know, I was thinking about what you asked me the other night.
You were wondering if I had a second cell phone.
And, well, I've been thinking about that a lot...
...and I think what you heard was my cell phone alarm going off.
I've been using it a lot as a medication reminder...
...to, well, remind me to take my medication.
And, well, the weird thing is that...
...the alarm sound is almost exactly the same...
...as the regular phone ring which is really a poor design...
...if you ask me. But I think that was probably it.
I tried to go in and change it to a different sound...
...other than the phone ring, but...
They so overcomplicate these things.
Anyway, it was probably just as well that I lost it.
There's gotta be a new one on the market by now.
You know, if we do this thing at UNM, maybe on the way home...
...we can stop by, and I can get a new cell phone.
Skyler?
Skyler?
Ready?
Yo, for what, might help.
Not another intervention.
Jesse Bruce Pinkman...
...pursuant to Section 47-8-13...
...of the New Mexico Real Property Code...
...you are hereby given notice to vacate...
...the premises listed as 9809 Margo, Albuquerque, 87104.
Wait. What? You're kicking me out of my own house?
It's your aunt Ginny's house.
And she gave it to me.
She never gave it to you, Jesse.
You were allowed residentiary privileges.
Your parents have always been the property owners.
Look, we talked about this, okay? I'd sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.
That was the deal. What the hell happened?
What happened is you're a speed manufacturer.
No, I'm not. What?
A DEA agent came looking for you, Jesse.
He came to our front door.
Okay, because I've actually been helping them...
...which I could get into a lot of trouble for telling you...
...so you're welcome.
I saw your basement.
Oh, yeah.
I was worried, so I went over there and I let myself in...
...and I found your laboratory.
You guys have your own key?
Manufacture of a Schedule ll controlled substance...
...is a second degree felony.
Under federal asset seizure...
...the government can take the entire house.
It's not even there anymore. I cleaned it all out.
Son, we can't stop you from ruining your life...
...but you will not drag us down with you.
Vacate the house in 72 hours.
Otherwise, your parents have authorised me...
...to contact the authorities. Is that clear?
Do you have any questions for us?
Three days, Mr. Pinkman.
Come on.
Hi.
Hey.
I fixed the garage door.
Great.
Yeah.
One track was bent. That's why it was bouncing.
Okay.
Where were you today?
Out.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking about going back to those meetings...
...the cancer support group.
I think that that's good.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's good.
You were right on the money about that.
It's good to, you know...
...talk about things.
I think that's great.
Yeah.
Jesse.
Jesse. Hey, Jesse.
You don't answer your phone?
Yeah, no, I've just been...
...pretty busy. How'd you--?
Oh, right, you have that key.
Hey, listen.
So I've been thinking a lot about our conversation...
...we had the other day, and I completely get why...
...Dad totally tweaked off on me like that and...
It's not just your father, Jesse.
No, I know. I know. I know.
I'm just saying it was a really, really big wake-up call for me...
...which is why I wanted to talk to you. You know, I've been...
...thinking real seriously about business school, actually.
You can do the whole thing from your computer now...
No, Mom, Mom. Hey, hey, this is good.
You know, we're talking, starting a dialogue.
The time for talking has passed, Jesse.
Hey. Hey.
What the hell, yo?
I thought it was just a wake-up call.
We are putting it in storage.
When you decide to grow up, you can have it back.
Why don't you grow up, Mom?
Ginny wanted me here. I was the one who took care of her.
I took her to her appointments and made her lunch every day.
I earned this.
You did not make her lunch every day.
What did you do, huh?
She's lying there dying, and where the hell are you?
Don't start with me.
Now what?
You've decided to, I don't know, make your eldest son homeless?
Great family, Mom.
Why are you like this? Why?
You have two sets of keys and the padlock to the garage.
Leave them on the kitchen counter when you leave.
No, Mom, Mom, Mom.
Hey, where am I supposed to go?
I don't know, sweetheart.
But please turn your life around.
Yeah, this is gonna help bigtime with that. Bitch!
Jeez.
Oh, hey, Mr. White.
Hey, well, that's the way. Don't just sit out there honking.
Come in and say hello.
Hey, we've got omelettes. You want an omelette?
No, I'm good.
New Mexican Christmas style, red and green chillies.
No. Thank you, though.
Flynn and me gotta get going.
Who's Flynn?
Flynn.
He's your...
Flynn?
Yeah.
So?
So? Nothing.
You ready?
Like it.
Bye, Mr. White.
Okay.
Bye.
Flynn? You know about this Flynn thing?
Okay. Flynn. Yeah. As in what, Errol?
I don't know. It's what he likes to be called these days.
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?
Don't take it personally.
He wants his own identity.
You think he told Louis about me?
About the blackout?
Louis is his friend, Walt...
...and your disappearance upset him.
Hey, I made omelettes.
I'm going out, but thanks, though.
Where you going?
Can you get the phone, please?
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
<i>- White residence.
Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?</i>
What part of "no contact" didn't you understand?
<i>- I know, but there's a problem.
I don't care. We agreed.</i>
No amount of pay-per-view channels is gonna make any difference.
Honey, we're happy with our cable provider, right?
Yeah, we're happy.
Skyler? Sky?
Where are you going? Can you at least tell me that?
Out.
Should probably get that, Walt. I'll be back in a few hours.
Skyler.
What?
Yo, I get I shouldn't call...
...but I'm in a situation here, and I need my money.
I just gave you $600.
And thanks, Daddy Warbucks...
...but that was before my housing situation...
...went completely testicular on me, okay?
<i>You smoked the entire 600, didn't you?</i>
<i>- What? No.
Yes.</i>
<i>- No.
Look, Jesse...</i>
<i>...your problems are just that.:</i>
Your problems.
No contact. Do not call here ever.
<i>- When the moment is right, I will call.
Mr. White, you're not listening.</i>
They're kicking me out of my house.
You son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.
Thanks, man. Hey, guy! You forgot something! Yeah!
You forgot your ice trays! You're gonna need the ice trays!
Hey, you forgot something here! Take this!
Hold on, buddy.
Yo, we should get Twaughthammer up and running again, yo. I'm serious.
I know. That sounded tight.
Hey, thanks again, P.
I made sure this stucknut exterminator, you know, put me on his speed dial.
Two nights tops.
No, you still staying at your aunt's on Margo?
Yeah. I'm thinking of moving. Nob Hill, probably.
Jess-a-matic. Living the dream.
Yeah.
Okay, buddy. You're gonna eat your carrots like we talked about, right?
Too hot.
No, no, buddy. Remember. Okay? Come on, yes.
Listen, hey, talk to me, man.
Are you still having mad relations out there?
You can talk to me. I won't hate a player.
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic out there, female-wise.
Damn. I'm hating, man.
That's why we need to get the Hammer up and running, you know?
Get you out of the house.
How awesome would that be?
Come on. Look. What?
I cut all the green parts off like you-- Just eat them. Please?
We should do this. Track down Cheevo and Anthony and demo up.
Get back in the scene.
I'm sorry, man. Just hold on one second, all right?
Okay, listen. How about you take a bite of your sandwich...
...and then you take--
Mommy's home.
Hi.
Hello.
Hey, honey, you remember Jesse Pinkman?
His house is getting bug bombed. I said he could crash a few nights.
Hey, Jesse.
Hey.
Paul, could you help me in the bedroom with these?
Sure. Yeah.
Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too.
Hey, Hen, I think it's someone's nap time. Come on.
Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.
I totally spaced that the in-laws are crashing this weekend.
You got other people to call?
No, that's cool. I got tons of people. Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yo, in-laws?
Sucks to be you, P.
Yeah. Yeah, I know, huh?
Here.
See you, man.
It's good to see you.
Look, I'm asking to crash three, maybe four nights, and--
Look, I already called Badger, all right? I called everyone.
I need a solid here, bro.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
All right. All right. Hey, how about this?
What if it's just for tonight?
Wait. No, you cannot be serious.
You cannot be serious.
Hey.
Someone took your bike, man.
Not cool.
Morning.
Oh, hey.
Morning.
Where did--? Where did Mom go?
Out.
Where's breakfast?
Hey.
Let's go do something.
Like what?
Something fun.
All right, ready? Let's put it in gear.
Is your foot on the-- Okay. Good.
Yeah. I got it.
Good.
Yes. Nice and smooth. Good. Just like that.
Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2. Very nice.
Okay, let's slow down here...
...to a stop in preparation for a left-hand turn. Okay.
All right. You might wanna go easier on the brake.
Sorry about that.
That's all right. You're doing fine.
Much better than last time, huh?
Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.
Has he?
Good. Good. Okay.
Don't forget the turn indic-- Good.
I'll stop talking. You know what you're doing.
And let's make that left-hand turn.
Nice and smooth. Very nice.
Right hand.
Good. Good. Okay.
Are you using both feet?
Yeah.
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt. You can't do that.
You can't use one foot on each pedal.
Why not?
Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.
Just stop, please. Right. All right.
Dad, this is way easier.
There's the easy way, and then there's the right way, right?
So let's just try it again, right foot only.
All right.
Okay?
Okay, just-- You don't have to-- Okay. All right. That's fine.
Just-- That's okay. That's okay. Just try it again.
Here we go. Let's just, just try it again.
Okay.
Don't-- Just easy. Okay, okay, good. Great.
That was better. See? Right? Better? Right.
The gas, the brake, the gas, the brake.
I can't do this.
My legs don't work that way.
Your legs are fine. You just have to stick with it.
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt. You're all right.
All right. We'll get this. I promise. Now let's just try again. All right?
All right.
Here we go. Here we go.
Okay, well, you don't need to, you know, just take off.
But all right, here we go. Slow it down just a little bit.
All right, we have a turn coming up here, so prepare to apply the brakes.
Prepare, Walt, for the brakes. Brakes, the brakes.
Braking.
You're using both feet again.
It's not stopping.
That's the gas. Use the brake.
The break. Brake, brake, brake!
Okay.
That's one way to stop.
I told you.
Flynn.
Hands up, asshole!
Yo, yo, it's cool.
So help me, I will spread you.
No, please, no, all right? It's me, okay? It's Jesse.
All right? Look, this is my RV.
You towed it. Your cousin Badger, remember?
What the hell you doing here?
You smell like shit.
It's a long story.
So I fixed up your felonious rolling laboratory here...
...750 for the repair.
Make it a grand, counting the toilet plus the 500 you already owe me...
...and you're good to drive on out of here to someplace far away. Upwind.
Okay.
Here's the thing.
I can't pay you today.
But I can pay you this week, all right?
Seventeen fifty? We'll make it 1750, for, like, you know, interest.
I thought your word was your bond.
It totally is.
Definitely. I just don't have the money at this particular moment.
But I will, soon.
Here's my counteroffer.
I kick you out. I take payment from your inventory.
I know a guy that'll pay premium for this kind of crap.
All right. Two grand. Okay?
Two days, two grand. That's totally fair.
Just don't take my cook stuff. All right? That's all I got left.
Please, all right? I really...
God, I really need a break here. Okay?
Clovis, come on.
I don't know. There's a bunch of stuff in there.
There's something called methylamine. Me-- Meth...
However the hell you pronounce it. Methylamine.
I don't know. I banged on it. It sounds pretty full to me.
Holy shit. How much?
Hey! Hey!
Skyler.
Louis took Walt to school.
I was thinking maybe...
...this would be a good time to talk.
I dreamt that I owned an antique bicycle repair shop.
In Ireland.
Weird.
Sounds weird.
I wanted to apologise...
...for everything.
My...
...desire for privacy.
My emotional...
...unavailability.
Having cancer doesn't excuse all that.
I haven't been a good partner to you...
...and for that...
...I'm very sorry.
I love you.
And I love this family.
And I just...
...want to make sure that...
...we don't lose contact.
Thank you.
Okay.
I agree.
Is that it?
God.
God, how long are you gonna do this?
Do what?
This.
Not talking to me.
Going out all day and refusing to tell me where.
You are obviously angry with me about something...
...so let's talk about it.
Oh, God.
I feel like you're upset with me because you think...
...that I'm up to something.
Like what?
I have no idea, Skyler.
What, that I'm having an affair? Is that it? Is that what you think?
Is that why you asked me about the...
Some other phone? Because you think that I'm being unfaithful?
I don't know.
Okay.
So ask me.
Why?
Would you even tell me?
Yes. I would.
Of course, I would.
And no. I'm not. I'm not having an affair, okay?
Now, what do I do to prove that to you?
Swear an oath? My right hand to God. I'm not having an affair.
I heard you, Walt.
You're not having an affair.
Congratulations.
No, you know what? Congratulations to you, Skyler.
Great job.
What is this? What do I have to do?
I'm trying to talk to you, and you--
Okay, so talk, Walt.
Shut up and say something that isn't complete bullshit.
You want to know what you have to do?
You have to tell me what's really going on right now.
Today. No more excuses.
No more apologies. No more of these-- These obvious...
...desperate breakfasts.
You don't wanna lose contact with me, Walt?
Good.
Then tell me.
Now.
Tell you what?
Skyler.
What is it you want me to tell you? I don't know.
We're not done here. Skyler.
Do you know what I've done for this family?
What the--?
Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?
What is wrong with you?
Why are you blue? Jesus.
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts with my parents being greedy...
...kleptomaniac douche bags.
Are you actually this stupid?
No, look. I know this isn't a optimal--
To come to my house and park on my street, driving this vehicle.
I mean, what the hell is wrong with you? I'm really asking.
Nothing. I'm sorry. I just--
What if Skyler had seen you?
What then? What was the plan then, genius, huh?
I don't know.
You know why you don't know?
Because you don't think. That's why.
You don't think. You never figured out how to think.
I said I was sorry. I just need my half of the money, and I will go.
Your half?
There is no your half of the money.
There is only my all of it. Do you understand?
Why should I be penalised because of your sloppiness?
Look, that is completely uncool, all right?
We agreed, fifty-fifty partners.
Partners in what? What exactly do you do here?
I've been meaning to ask, because I'm the producer, right?
I cook. But from what I can tell, you are just a drug addict.
You are a pathetic junkie, too stupid to understand and follow...
...simple rudimentary instructions. Too stupid to re--
Do it.
Try not to touch anything.
Want some breakfast?
ï»¿1
Well, we've come a long way, Walt.
Here at the end of round one...
...I'm gonna recommend cautious optimism.
We'll check back in two months, see how you've responded...
...reassess and decide our next move, if any.
That's right around the time the baby's due, correct?
Yeah.
Well, try to think of this as good timing.
You'll start feeling better soon, more like yourself.
And your hair should start to come back.
Kind of gotten used to the old cue-ball look.
I prefer to think of it as streamlined.
Right. Aerodynamic.
So no more confusion?
No more--?
No. No. Absolutely none.
How are you two holding up?
Fine.
I mean, you know, we're busy...
...but we're good. Absolutely.
It's all good.
So we're not going through an insurer. Is that correct?
Yes. Direct bill.
Just need to print it out for you.
Thank you.
I thought we had discussed a cash discount.
Absolutely. It's included.
Just a reminder.
We do have a payment plan available, should you be interested.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Okay, well, then what about the MRI?
Can you--? Can you please explain to me...
...the distinction between diagnostic and exploratory?
Yeah, but either way, his doctor ordered it.
Okay, you know, it should be covered.
You bet I will. Yeah, in triplicate.
Okay. Well, I'm sorry you couldn't be of more help too.
Yeah. Okay.
Bitch.
Hi.
Been around someone who smokes?
No.
The hospital bill came.
That was fast.
Yeah.
Three-day stay, 13,000 and counting.
Is this something that Gretchen and Elliott might cover?
I mean...
...I know it's strictly your domain, but...
They will. I'm sure they will.
I'll handle it.
Oh, God.
Bring me up to speed on Tuco Salamanca.
Dead.
Still?
Completely.
Okay, then.
Well, thanks for stopping by.
Okay.
So things are quiet, you know. Not a lot of crystal on the streets now.
Good.
Of course, that's not gonna last.
Wait to see who rallies the roaches now that turf's up for grabs.
No takers so far?
Well, we keep hearing a name. Heisenberg.
Lately pretty much every dime-bagger we come across.
Heisenberg?
Yeah, I know.
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking that big blue we keep finding.
Anyway, we'll stay on it.
Know why sharks are at the top of the food chain, Hank?
Because they have three sets of teeth and will take a bite out of anything?
Some of those suckers travel thousands of miles...
...in pursuit of their prey.
Yeah, I think I heard that.
You, my friend, are a great white.
How does Albuquerque liaison...
...Tri-State Border Interdiction Task Force sound?
Like one hell of a promotion.
As of the 1st, I want you to split your time between here and El Paso.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
What you gonna do without me, Gomey?
Celebrate. I won't have to look at your ugly mug six days a week.
Hey, buddy, I am the brains and the brawn.
I'm the whole package.
I'm glad I didn't just eat.
I'm surprised your head still fits through the door.
You wanna grab lunch?
Hell, yeah. Because you're buying.
Done. I'll meet you morons downstairs.
Try not to get lost on the way.
Schrader.
Yeah. Hey, Ricky.
How you doing? Yeah, I'm stoked too.
Yeah, El Paso.
Here's the man.
Hey, congratulations, Hank.
Thanks.
Gets two in the sand, two in the forest, you know?
And then he says, "Give me a four," you know?
Hey. Hey.
Hey.
Got some nerve coming back here.
Or you're even dumber than I thought.
Yeah, well, maybe both.
Balance for the tow, the repairs...
...and extra for damages and stuff, the gate...
...the toilet.
Look, like I said...
...my word is my bond.
What would you charge me to store this here?
A million-five.
Come on, yo.
Your sister.
Dog, I'm serious, all right?
I got storage needs. And I got scratch up front.
We could, you know, negotiate.
Five hundred.
A month?
A week.
For real?
See you.
Wait, wait, wait.
Just hold on. Just chill.
Okay. Sounds good. Totally doable.
Outside.
Inside.
Forget it.
Man, come on.
Your fence is too easy to climb.
Inside, padlocked, plus gate privileges.
Come again?
Gate, in and out, privileges.
Month to month. Cash up front. Inside.
And I don't know you. I don't know jack.
Yeah.
You selling?
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.
What about that one?
Serious?
It's Jane, right?
Well, Jane, I gotta say, this place is awesome.
Really? Does it inspire awe?
No. I mean, you know, it's great.
Just what I've been looking for. That's what I meant.
I had an entire house before, detached and all...
...but I was just tired of the lawn care, upkeep and whatnot. You know?
Well, the blinds are new. Everything's been painted.
Jesus.
Utilities are included.
Stacking. Sweet.
You got cable?
Already wired. Just call to activate.
High speed, whatever.
Bathroom, cool tile.
Bedroom.
Nice.
I'm a fan of the hardwood.
So you're interested?
Definitely. Definitely, yeah.
And you're good with NP, NS?
Sorry. What?
In the ad? No smoking, no pets. You wanna smoke, you do it outside.
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. It's cool. No worries.
All right, the usual drill. I'll need a W-2 or recent pay stub, current employer...
...former address, you know, the yadda yadda.
And if it's all copacetic, I'll call.
Yeah. Look...
...the thing is...
...I can...
Unbelievable.
I'm just currently between situations.
Then I'm currently not renting.
Look, look, I got the money and I'm totally good for it for, like, ever.
Come on, yo, can you please, please just help a brother out?
Yo, my dad's not really a make-exceptions kind of guy.
Trust me.
Your dad?
Owns the place. I manage it.
Pen on paper. That's what I need.
Or go run your game somewhere else.
Dude, I got nowhere else to go. This is it.
And I got no game, all right?
I just need a chance.
Look, my folks, they kicked me out.
I'm a disappointment, apparently.
Didn't meet their expectations again.
So you know, now I'm persona non gratis or whatever.
But you know what? I'm a good person and I work hard.
I will pay you every month and I will pay you on time.
I will not mess this up, okay? I swear.
Rent just went up.
A hundred more a month. That's the cash price.
Yes.
Okay. Yes.
Hey, you rock. Thank you. Thank you. You won't regret this.
And in addition to first and last, I want two more months.
DBAA fee, non-refundable.
Yeah, of course. No problem. DBAA. Obviously, yeah.
All right. So, what's DBAA?
Don't be an asshole.
Gotcha.
I live next door.
Really?
Don't think for one second you have squatter's rights, because you don't.
If you blow this, I want you gone.
I know guys that'll have your skinny ass out back by the Dumpster...
...faster than you can blink.
I'll fill it in. Just sign your name.
Which is what, by the way?
It's Jesse.
Jesse Jackson.
Seriously?
What?
What are you doing?
Beating off. What's it look like?
That is in fact exactly what it looks like to me.
Brewing is an art form, Marie. I think you'd appreciate that by now.
Christmas, batch of '06? Come on.
So let me get this straight.
You call in sick the day after receiving a long-awaited...
...career-boosting promotion...
...so you can play Oktoberfest in your man cave?
I don't get it. Really, I don't.
Babe, relax.
Please, don't tell me to relax.
Sorry, I forgot.
You know I hate that.
Right.
Dave said I should express that.
All I'm saying is everything's fine.
I can take a day.
No big deal.
Now get that sweet ass out of here so I can concentrate.
<i>Okay, so, what's the plan?</i>
The plan is we cook.
Why are we cooking when we can't even move what we cook?
Well, how much do you think you can sell on your own?
Say if I cook during the days and you work the nights.
Dude.
What?
Prior to Tuco, that was your plan, wasn't it?
I understand it'll be a fraction of what we brought in before...
...but still, what choice do we have?
First of all, there's no we.
Okay? You're talking me, solo, busting hump slinging shards.
I got profile now.
Don't you get that? DEA's up my ass.
No, I'm not exposing myself to that level of risk for chump change.
No way.
Then what do you suggest?
I don't think either of us are eager to jump into bed with another Tuco.
I got bills, man.
You've got bills?
Rent, yo. Responsibilities.
I've already lost more than I've made...
...and I am tired of dicking around out here.
You wanna know how much I've got left?
After completing my first round of treatment...
...and financing the world's most expensive alibi?
Zero. Zip. Nothing.
I've got nothing to show for all of this. Nothing for my family...
...which, as you might remember, was the whole damn point.
But seeing as throwing in the towel is not an option...
...that leaves us with a total of two choices.
We go into business with yet another homicidal lunatic...
...or you and I start--
You selling whatever you can.
There's a third way.
And what would that be?
We got to be Tuco.
All right? Cut out the middleman. Run our own game.
So you're going to what?
Snort meth off a bowie knife?
You gonna beat your homeys to death when they "dis" you?
Look, I know some guys. All right? I can create a network.
Look, we control production and distribution.
That way, we stay off the front lines while moving some serious glass.
I mean, the point here is to make money, right?
Sky-high stacks.
No.
No? That's not the point?
No, I am not willing to do that.
Who said anything about you?
I don't vote for this plan.
I'm not comfortable bringing in unknown entities into our operation.
Yeah? Well, you don't get to vote.
I beg your pardon?
This is a partnership, remember?
I rem-- Oh, I remember.
Yeah, you cook, I sell.
That was the division of labour when we started all this.
And that's exactly how we should have kept it.
Because I sure as hell didn't find myself locked in a trunk...
...or on my knees with a gun to my head...
...before your greedy old ass came along. All right?
All right, I will admit to a bit of a learning curve.
And perhaps I was overly ambitious.
In any case, it's not gonna happen that way anymore.
Yeah, damn straight.
Know why?
Because we do things my way this time...
...or I walk.
You need me more than I need you, Walt.
<i>Yo, enter my casa. Yo, Skinny Pete. What's up, brother?</i>
What up with it, yo?
Hey, Combo. Good to see you. Welcome to my humble abode.
Good deal, mover. Good deal.
Yo, Badge, hey.
Cool crib, man.
Hey, it echoes.
Hello.
Hello. Hello, hello, hello.
Let me give you the virtual tour, okay?
So plasma is gonna go right here.
Probably like 50-inch, you know, wall-mounted.
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.
No. They burn in, yo.
But the picture's, like, way sharper. Blacks are deeper too.
They got 3-D coming out, like, any day now.
That's what I'm waiting for.
Porn, coz. You know?
Jesus.
Like 3-D tatas, like right in your face.
Yeah. So, I'm gonna get a couple of those zero-gravity chairs...
...for, like, right here, for your ultimate viewing comfort.
Those are buck.
It's gonna be pretty much sparse. Very Asiany, modern stuff.
Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.
Yeah.
I'm thinking, you know, just a bunch of candles...
...maybe one of those little fountain jobs right here.
It's gonna be chill.
The ladies...
...they cream up real nice for, like, candles and shit.
You are going to score, big time.
All right, so how about we get, you know, down to it?
There's some refreshments over here if you wanna partake.
You got any other refreshments?
I could kick it. It's been a while.
Yes, yes.
I could totally go for a loving spoonful.
No, no, no. No bomb, no beer, no weed. All right?
You smoke it up on your own time. We're talking business here.
Okay? So listen up.
This is how it goes. I front each of you an ounce.
You sell it for 2,500. I keep the two, you keep the five.
No cutting it. You sell it as is, all right?
Twenty-five hundred an ounce?
That's kind of hopeful, bro.
Yeah, Jesse, street's maybe 17, 18.
Seventeen.
Okay, A, this is the best shiz ever.
All right? Everybody and their mother's gonna want a taste. And second...
...who else is selling right now, huh?
It's dry out there, that's for sure.
Church.
So you point it how you want, okay? Quarter, half, teener, whatever.
But I make what I make. Two large. No exceptions.
Short me, you're out.
Cut it, you're out.
Period.
This is a big opportunity I am giving you.
Understand?
Badger, what is this?
A big opportunity.
Exactly. All right? This is the ground floor.
Gentlemen, how far you go is up to you.
So bring out the product, yo.
No, no, no. Not here, all right? Not ever.
Blind drop. I will let you know when and where.
All right? So you'll be hearing from me.
Now, I got mad volume.
So you move it quick, you move it right...
...there is always more.
Okay, DBAA, mofos. All right?
Apply yourselves.
Hell, yeah.
Hell, yeah.
Hey, there's the big guy.
Congratulations, Uncle Hank.
Hey, Hank.
It's an armpit.
It's not an armpit.
Oh, excuse me.
You're right. It's the Paris of the Southwest.
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.
Right on the border of lawless Mexican hell.
Human heads, they leave.
The cartels, they litter the place with human heads.
Yeah, well, pretty sure that's why I'm going there.
It's like a calling card or a shoutout or something.
Now, D.C., on the other hand, I could get behind.
You just do your time like a good boy...
...and I could see us in a cute little condo in Georgetown...
...in a couple of years.
I went online to this fantastic...
...real estate website for D.C.
There's just so much, I don't know, culture there.
I was talking to Melinda, Hank's boss's wife.
I told you about the one with helmet hair and permanent lip liner.
Anyway, she was saying that when they were there--
Apologise.
What?
I will not listen to one more word until you apologise.
For?
You know perfectly well, Marie.
Well, obviously I don't--
Your lies.
To me.
The shoplifting.
All of it.
Did you really think it was all just neatly gonna go away?
Well, if you hadn't tried to return it--
Apologise.
Now or never. I mean it.
Or it'll never be the same.
Why are you punishing me?
If you don't respect me enough to apologise, to tell me the truth, then--
I need my sister back.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What, do you want the gory details?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
No, you don't.
Keep you up at night.
So was it scary?
Hell, yeah, it was freaking scary, you little punk.
Jesus.
But you were way faster than him.
Well, I'm here, aren't I?
Yeah. Hell, yeah.
Kick ass and take names.
Son.
No, it's fine.
You know what it is?
A cockroach comes out from under a fridge, what do you do?
I mean, you don't think about it.
You stomp them down.
Where do they come from?
Criminals, like the one you...
I mean, what do you think it is that makes them who they are?
Buddy, you might as well be asking me about the roaches.
All I know is there's a whole world of them out there.
Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.
Cops.
Cops!
Wasn't sure it was you.
New car?
Yeah, keeping things on the DL.
I'm guessing this one doesn't bounce.
Your half.
Fifteen K. That's what I'm talking about.
You're welcome.
Jesus.
Help me understand the math, okay?
I gave you 1 pound, correct?
You and I split $2,000 per ounce.
$1,000 each.
One pound, that's 16 ounces.
Sixteen ounces should net to me $16,000.
Sixteen. Not 15.
Something came up.
Something came up?
One of my guys got held up by a couple junkies.
Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay? Skinny Pete's cool.
So you're saying that your guy got robbed--
Or rather you got robbed.
-but it doesn't matter.
Dude, it's called breakage, okay?
Like Kmart. Shit breaks.
And you're thinking this is acceptable?
It's the cost of business, yo.
You're sweating me over a grand?
Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here. I'm not the street guy, yo.
But it seems to me that what you call breakage...
...is just you making a fool of yourself.
I've got another technical term for you.
Non-sustainable business model.
You're focusing on the negative.
Six grand a day we're making. What's your problem?
What happens when word gets out...
...and it's open season on these clowns you've hired?
Once everyone knows that Jesse Pinkman...
...drug lord, can be robbed with impunity.
Man, come on.
You think Tuco had breakage?
I guess it's true, he did.
He broke bones.
He broke the skull of anybody who tried to rip him off.
You want another grand? Is that it?
That's not my point.
Take it. Here.
Look, you got 15,000 you didn't have yesterday.
Hey, we're making bank. Shit happens.
My guys get what they're up against and they're careful.
So am I.
And you're all tucked in at night with your precious family.
So why don't you just stop being such a freak about everything?
You've made the division of labour very clear.
Yo, I mean, seriously...
...what the hell do you want me to do, huh?
Hey.
Sorry.
Wow, you snuck in.
Didn't even know you were home.
What you eating?
A panini. There's another one in the freezer if you want it.
I thought we nixed those, huh?
Did we?
Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones with the off-the-chart sodium?
I had a craving.
Once in a while is no big deal.
So where's Jr.?
Out.
With whom?
Louis.
Out where?
Somewhere. I don't know.
He'll be back by 9.
Okay.
Yeah, I just thought you might have a clue where your son is.
Why don't you?
Why am I the only one who needs to keep track of our son?
I'll tell you what. Wanna know where he is, ask him.
Just pick up the phone like I do.
Great.
Perhaps you might know something...
...about this.
Perhaps.
And then again...
...perhaps I don't, Walt.
Perhaps I smoked them in a fugue state.
I'd like an explanation, please.
You don't wanna go down that road.
Why would you do this?
You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
Three and a half cigarettes...
...won't do a thing to the baby.
Nothing.
I'm glad you're so sure, doctor.
Three and a half. That was it. I tossed the rest.
And I'm sure you'll be very glad to hear that, yes, I feel ashamed.
Skyler, this-- I mean, this is something that--
This is so unlike you. Why--?
Really?
How would you know?
No, thank you.
Hank.
Jesus.
Yo.
You asked me what I want you to do.
I want you to handle it.
ï»¿1
Yo.
Yo.
What up?
Damn, bitch.
You got something for me?
Yeah. Yeah, I found them.
Is this a five or an S?
Five, yo.
No, wait. S.
No, no. Yeah, five.
Yeah?
Jesus, how the hell do you spell "street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?
Hey, man.
I'm slinging mad volume and fat stacking Benjies.
I can't be all about, like, spelling and shit.
Hey.
So they got names?
Hers is, like, I don't know. She's just his woman is all.
Him, they call Spooge.
Spooge? Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?
Let me get this straight. You got jacked...
...by a guy named Spooge?
Yo, what's his name matter?
All's I saw was that knife he stuck in my face, like that big.
If you're looking for a reason not to go do this thing...
Did I say that?
Because I'll go do it myself.
It's just I'm on probation and all.
Yeah.
So you gonna do it?
Yeah.
Good. Right on.
Because these two, they need to get got.
Where's my money, bitch? Where's my money?
Where's my--?
Where's my money, bitch? Huh, bitch?
Where's my money, bitch? Oh, that's good.
Where's my money?
Where's my money, bitch? Bitch, where's my money?
Come on.
I will mess you up.
That how you wanna play this? Your call.
Your funeral, jack.
Hey, do not mess with me. I will bury you because I'm crazy, yo.
<i>Yeah, mucho loco.</i>
Do not test me.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Honey, you blocking the mailbox.
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.
Looks like it's gonna be a nice day, huh?
Yeah. Yeah. High 70s.
You have a great day.
Right on. You too.
God. Shit.
Yo, anybody home?
Hello?
<i>Tonight, you will receive the ultimate mixture of cutlery...</i>
<i>...tonight in the steel knock out.</i>
<i>Every phone line jammed. Eighty-nine dollars on flex pay.</i>
<i>That's 15 easy instalments.</i>
<i>And, folks, the knock out is only--</i>
Hey, yo, is anybody else home?
<i>Now, Terry put this one together--</i>
Where's your folks? They here?
<i>--And I'm here to tell you--</i>
<i>Yeah, guys, you might wanna put up like a...</i>
<i>Already done it.</i>
<i>Tonight, folks...</i>
<i>Do you realise how long it's been...</i>
<i>...since we've offered this sword in this set?</i>
<i>Much less the watashi and tanto as a bonus in the deal.</i>
<i>It's no wonder--</i>
<i>It is no wonder so many of you are on the line right now--</i>
What's your name?
<i>I'm gonna count this as one. Even though there are three, I'm--</i>
My name's Diesel.
<i>--Eleven, 12, 13--</i>
<i>--sixteen, 17, 18, 19...</i>
Yo, don't you wanna watch something other than this?
<i>Like, I don't know, Mister Rogers'?</i>
<i>Imagine this plan, this set in your own home.</i>
<i>Folks, custom pieces--</i>
<i>Well, needless to say, I've made a pretty good mess...</i>
<i>...but there's a reason for that.</i>
<i>Just because these are under $10, don't let anybody kid you.</i>
<i>These knives possess edges like...</i>
So when are your folks coming home?
Your dad, Mr. Spooge? When is he getting back?
I'm hungry.
<i>Hey there, you three.</i>
<i>Just wanted to wish Walt a good first day back.</i>
<i>We'll be thinking about you teaching valences and covalences...</i>
<i>Okay, that's all I officially remembered. Good luck.</i>
<i>Skyler, give me a call when you get a chance.</i>
<i>Hi, Walt and Skyler. This is Gretchen Schwartz...</i>
<i>...calling to say hello.</i>
<i>I'm down from Santa Fe today and I was thinking about you both...</i>
<i>...hoping everything's well.</i>
<i>I tried Walt's cell, and it said the number had been disconnected...</i>
<i>...so I'm just hoping that everything's okay.</i>
<i>Call me if you can, whenever's convenient.</i>
<i>- Hello?
Oh, hi, Gretchen.</i>
<i>This is Skyler White. Am I catching you at a bad time?</i>
No. No, not at all.
It's so good to hear from you. How is everybody?
<i>We're very well, thank you.</i>
Walt is actually at work today. It's his first day back at work...
<i>...and he lost his cell phone quite a while back.</i>
And I really hope we didn't worry you.
No, no. I'm just so glad to hear that everybody's fine.
That's wonderful.
Gretchen, I'm so very, very long overdue in telling you this...
...and I have to take Walt at his word that he's been passing it along for me.
<i>I mean, he's been so adamant...</i>
...about wanting to handle this whole thing by himself, and...
But I have picked up the phone about a hundred times. I just--
<i>- What? What is it?
I can't...</i>
...begin to thank you and Elliott for what you've done.
<i>The money for Walt's treatment, it's just...</i>
It saved us.
I don't know if I...
Walt keeps saying, "Don't bother them. It's no big deal."
But it is a big deal. Yeah.
To me. And to all of us.
So I just...
...finally wanted to say thank you.
<i>Anyway...</i>
End of speech.
So I do-- I hope we get to see you soon.
Truly, anytime you're in town, anytime at all, is good for us.
<i>- How about this afternoon?
Yeah, okay.</i>
Monoalkenes, diolefins...
...trienes, polyenes.
I mean, the nomenclature alone is enough to make your head spin.
But when you start to feel overwhelmed...
...and you will...
...just keep in mind that one element...
...carbon.
Carbon is at the centre of it all.
There is no life without carbon.
Nowhere that we know of in the universe.
Everything that lives, lived, will live, carbon.
Carmen is carbon.
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen. Did you...?
No. Okay.
I like to think of it...
I like to think that the diamond...
...and the woman who wears it on her finger...
...are both formed from the same stuff.
Or, say, the diamond and the man who invented it.
That got your attention, right?
The man who invented the diamond. All right.
H. Tracy Hall. Write this name down.
Dr. Hall invented the first reproducible process...
...for making synthetic diamonds.
I mean, this is way back in the '50s.
Now, today, synthetic diamonds are used in oil drilling...
...electronics, multi-billion-dollar industries.
At the time, Dr. Hall worked for General Electric.
And he made them a fortune. I mean, incalculable.
You wanna know how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?
A $10 U.S. Savings Bond.
Anyway...
A savings bond printed on carbon-based paper...
...paid to a carbon-based man...
...for something he made out of carbon.
<i>It's so nice to have you back with us.</i>
You're looking great, by the way.
A little skinnier, which is definitely no tragedy.
And then there's the hair thing.
I actually like that.
That's a great look for you.
But you're feeling good?
Oh, absolutely. Hundred percent.
It's...
I'm glad to be back at work.
I'm glad to... You know, I'm happy to be here. Really.
We're happy too.
And I just...
Yeah. It's good. It's great.
Is everything okay?
Just please feel comfortable coming to me...
...with any problems, any issues. Anything at all.
You know, completely confidential.
Okay?
See you tomorrow, Flynn.
See you, Jeffrey.
Oh, man.
Let me see it.
Dad, let me see it.
Don't worry about it.
Hey, let's go.
<i>Forty-eight dollars, that's the original price...</i>
Hey.
Peekaboo.
No?
Peekaboo.
Oh, man.
Oh, my hand is cramping up!
Oh, my God. Here, here, here.
Now, I don't know. If you want your hand to stop aching...
...I gave you advice, take it or leave it.
Okay, you stay right here, all right? Okay? I mean it.
Shut up!
You shut up.
You shut up, you--
You shut up!
You're the one who dropped it.
I didn't drop it.
I didn't drop--
Shit! You dropped it.
Shut the hell up about it.
You shut up!
You shut up.
Get up.
Shut up. Shut up! Both of you.
You know who might have done it?
I have an idea.
Well, here's what I think.
You ID them, and then together, you and I put a bag over their heads...
...we tie them up, drive them way out into the desert, strip them naked...
...then bury them up to their necks in a huge mound of fire ants.
Saw it in an old Western.
You with me?
Scorpions?
Scorpions are good.
Yeah.
Nice.
Damn, Dad. Check it out.
Who is this?
So this is Walter Jr., or Flynn.
He likes to go by Flynn these days.
Mom.
What? I'm just offering the choice.
This is Mrs. Schwartz, whom you've heard so much about.
Very nice to meet you, Flynn.
Nice to meet you too.
Oh, Walt.
Look who's here.
Gretchen.
Hi.
Always nice to see you. What a nice surprise.
Look at you. You're looking good.
Though a bald head is a bit of a shocker.
I know it was for me.
Oh, you have a good-shaped head.
May I?
Oh, sure.
For good luck, right?
Exactly. Here's hoping.
We could use some of that.
Yeah.
Mrs. Schwartz, thank you so much for what you've done for my dad.
It was a really good thing.
You're very welcome.
We're gonna find a way to repay you.
No, no, no.
We don't wanna ever hear that.
You know, I hate to say it...
...but I really need to get going.
Oh, that's too bad.
You can't stay for dinner?
I wish I could...
...but unfortunately, I have to try to beat the traffic.
Okay. Okay.
Well, I hope we get a chance to catch up real soon.
Yeah, hopefully.
Gretchen, your purse.
Well, good to see you.
And you and Elliott are welcome anytime. Really.
And I, for one, am gonna be much better about keeping in touch.
It's so good to see you.
And you.
Nice meeting you.
Likewise.
Okay. Bye, now.
Drive safely.
You know, what am I thinking? I should walk her to her car. Really.
I'll be right back.
Gretchen.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey yourself.
What did you...?
We need to talk.
Can you not do or say anything to anyone until then?
Please. Please.
Where's my money, bitch? I ain't gonna keep asking nice!
Yo, all right? I want my money and my dope. Come on!
I just wanna say, man--
What? What do you wanna say?
I just wanna go on record, man.
You hit me really, really hard, man. I think I'm seeing double.
Maybe I need to go see a hospital.
Shut up!
Jesus.
Serious, I might have a concussion.
Don't fall asleep, baby.
Subdural hematoma.
Don't fall asleep.
Shut up.
All right. Empty your pockets.
Turn them out, everything on the table.
Do it!
All right, turn around.
Turn around.
Turn out your back pockets. Come on.
All right. Shoes. Give them here.
I told you, Diesel, we ain't holding any--
We shot it all.
Yeah?
Shot an ounce in a day and a half?
Yeah.
All right, tell you what.
Both of you pull it out of your butts right now...
...or I grab a flashlight and some pliers and go exploring.
What's it gonna be, yo? Come on.
There you go.
All right, come on. On the table.
All right, so, what, you hold the crystal and she holds the H, huh?
Division of labour.
All right, there's maybe an 8 ball here.
Where's the rest of my meth?
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.
You shut up.
You shut up, skank.
Shut up! Shut up! Stop it!
This really isn't getting any better, man. It's turning cranial.
Oh, yeah? You see this gun? It's got five bullets.
One for each kneecap, plus an extra round for your cranial...
...for being such a pussy.
Hey. Hey, baby.
Come here, baby. Come here, baby.
All right.
You two are never getting high again.
I will make it my life's mission.
Not another needle, not another ball...
...not one toke, not till I get what's mine.
Yeah, we got you covered, man, sure.
It just so happens we got your money, man, plus interest.
You're damn right, plus interest.
Where?
Back yard.
Yo, right hand to the man, dog. Back yard. Go check it out.
Hurting. Painful.
Hey, hey, hey.
Me and your old man, we're just playing a game, all right?
Hey, don't move.
Come on.
See?
Me and the slit just boosted it, yo. She's like a ant, man.
She can lift a hundred times her own weight. For real.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Help me break it open. Take out the money, get paid.
Get high.
Yo, that's my bank.
So? It's FIDC insured, yo.
It's a victimless crime.
<i>Where did you get this?</i>
<i>Bodega. Way across town.</i>
<i>In, out, like, bam. Went smooth as silk, yo.</i>
<i>What, nobody saw you? What about witnesses, dumb-ass?</i>
<i>We roll like the breeze, for real.</i>
<i>All we did, we just walked in all smooth-like.</i>
<i>- Nobody even noticed.
Nobody noticed?</i>
<i>- For real?
I'm telling you, victimless crime.</i>
Oh, my God.
Jesus. Come on already.
It's about to give, man. I'm sensing it.
You don't know what you're doing.
I thought you told me you boosted, like, six of these.
Yeah. Boosted.
It's not like he ever got one open.
At least I got persistence.
The law of averages, lucky number seven.
Don't listen to that skank.
Stop calling me that.
I ain't no skank!
Skank, skank, skank--
Hey, hey, hey.
Sit, sit.
All right, I swear to God I will shoot you both in the face.
Now, chill.
You, get that thing open.
You sit the hell down, and no throwing things.
Where's the kid?
The kid. The little kid!
What are you asking me for?
I got you now, bitch. I got you now.
Didn't see that coming, huh?
What kind of mother are you?
How about you feed the kid a decent meal every now and then, huh?
Give him a bath. Put some baby powder on him.
Get him some decent TV to watch. I mean, what is this shit?
Are you serious?
You give me one hit, and I'll be any kind of mother that you want.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, Diesel...
...this thing would go easier if we all had a little taste, man.
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!
So you didn't tell anyone.
You didn't tell Elliott.
Not yet.
Well, what does that mean?
That means exactly what it means.
That's a determination I have yet to make.
All right, fair enough. I can appreciate that.
All right.
First let me say, I very much regret involving you in this.
This was...
This entire thing was unfortunate.
Unfortunate?
And I apologise deeply.
Thank you.
Now please tell me why you did it.
That's not really at issue here.
Well, you told me your insurance was covering it. Was that a lie?
If you won't take our money, and your insurance isn't covering it...
...how are you paying for it?
This is not an issue that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?
Excuse me, Walt. It does concern me. It concerns me greatly.
You tell your wife and son...
...that I am paying for your cancer treatment.
Why are you doing this?
I will clear this up with them.
The look on Skyler's face, she's sitting there, tears in her eyes...
...thanking me for saving your life.
Why would you do that to her?
As I said, I will clear this up.
Just please allow me to do this in my own way, in my own time.
All right?
I will explain the whole thing to them.
And while you're at it, explain it to me.
I don't owe you an explanation.
I owe you an apology, and I have apologised.
I am very sorry, Gretchen.
There. I've apologised twice now.
I'm humbly sorry.
Three times.
Let me just get this straight.
Elliott and I offer to pay for your treatment...
...no strings attached.
An offer which still stands, by the way.
And you turn us down out of pride, whatever...
...and then you tell your wife that in fact we are paying for your treatment.
Without our knowledge, against our will...
...you involve us in your lie.
And you sit here and tell me that that is none of my business?
Yeah. That's pretty much the size of it.
What happened to you?
Really, Walt.
What happened?
Because this isn't you.
What would you know about me, Gretchen?
What would your presumption about me be, exactly?
That I should go begging for your charity?
And you waving your chequebook around...
...like some magic wand is gonna make me forget...
...how you and Elliott--
How you and Elliott cut me out?
What? That can't be how you see it.
It was my hard work, my research, and you and Elliott make millions off it.
That cannot be how you see it.
Good. That's beautifully done.
You left--
You are always the picture of innocence.
You left me.
The picture of innocence.
Just sweetness and light.
You left me.
Newport, 4th of July weekend.
You and my father and my brothers and I go up to our room...
...and you're packing your bags, barely talking.
What? Did I dream all of that?
That's your excuse...
...to build your little empire on my work?
How can you say that to me? You walked away.
You abandoned us, me, Elliott.
Little rich girl just adding to your millions.
I don't even know what to say to you.
I don't even know where to begin.
I feel so sorry for you, Walt.
Fuck you.
Hey.
Hey, little man, you hungry?
Hey.
Man. No, no, what are you doing?
No, what are you doing?
Spooge, I got him, I got him.
Baby, get up and help me.
Call me a bad mother. I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.
Get up, damn it! Get our dope!
Bedtime.
Here we go. Oh, yeah.
Who's the big tough guy now, huh? Is that you?
Is that you? You're the big man?
Try and hit me now, bitch. Try and hit me now!
Try and hit me now, bitch.
Oh, hey.
Should I ask where you've been?
Never mind.
We're long past that, I suppose.
Skyler.
Gretchen called about an hour ago.
Walt.
We need to talk.
Just say it.
They're cutting off the money.
What did she say, exactly?
Not much. It was abrupt.
She said something like:
"I'm sorry to have to do this...
...but Elliott and I can no longer continue to pay for Walt's treatment.
I wish you the very best."
And that was it.
Yeah.
I mean, she sounded apologetic. I guess.
It was quick. She got right off the phone.
I was so stunned, but...
I called her back and she didn't pick up.
So, what do you know about this?
I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice visit this afternoon...
...and then you come home and she's in a big hurry to leave...
...and then the two of you are talking in the driveway.
Walt.
What do you know that I don't?
Where were you tonight?
I drove up to Santa Fe.
I was with Gretchen.
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.
She just couldn't bring herself to tell you today.
I mean, she couldn't tell me, either, really.
I mean, there was a lot of hemming and hawing...
...and beating around the bush--
Okay, what--? Tell us what?
Well...
There was a lot of...
...business phraseology being tossed around.
You know, things like "cash-poor" and "leveraged"...
..."quarterly decline," yadda, yadda, yadda.
But what they were truly saying, in my opinion...
They're broke.
You are kidding me.
No.
I mean, the economy's in the toilet. We all know that.
And all these big banks and Fannie Mae and...
Well, apparently, Gray Matter...
...is no more immune than anyone else.
That is--
Jesus, that's...
Yeah.
You know, she could have just told me herself.
Well, they're prideful people.
Listen.
Not to sound selfish...
...but as far as we go...
...we'll get through this, okay?
I mean, they've already paid for most of my treatment, right?
Hey.
We're gonna make it. All right? I promise.
Okay.
And yet...
...she still drives a Bentley.
Keeping up appearances. Who knows?
Baby, that don't make any sense.
Of course it makes sense. Every safe's got its weak spot, right?
You're designing a safe, where you gonna put your weak spot?
Nowhere.
I'd make it, like, strong.
Jesus. On the bottom, that's where.
You put your weak spot on the bottom.
Oh, baby, that H is bringing me down.
Yeah, you took too much. I told you.
I need to... I need to even out.
Let me get a hit of that crystal.
Hell, no. You lost your share.
Come on, baby.
It's all I need, just a little hit.
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank. I'm trying to concentrate.
I ain't no skank.
I would appreciate an apology.
What?
I am trying to take the high road here.
Are you gonna do right?
Listen to me, stupid.
I am in the middle of some very important work.
I am on the verge here, all right? So shut your skank ass pie hole...
...and assist me and shut up.
I ain't no skank.
Skank, skank, skank ass skank.
Skank ass skank. Skank ass skank.
You listening to me, skank?
You hear me, skank?
You are a skank ass skank. Skank.
Skank, skank, skank. Skank.
I ain't no skank.
No, no, no. Don't. No.
I ain't no skank.
<i>911.</i>
Hey, hey. Hey, you remember peekaboo?
Can you go peekaboo like this? Can you keep your eyes closed?
You keep them closed. That's good. That's good. That's good.
All right. You keep them closed just like that.
It's a little game we're gonna play, okay?
Here you go.
Hey. Hey, look at me. You wait right here. Okay?
It's just part of the game. You wait right here, and...
Look, just... Just don't go back inside. All right?
You stay right here. Okay?
You have a good rest of your life, kid.

Nitrogen bonds to oxygen, which in turn...
You do know what a bond is?
A strong force of attraction.
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.
The coming together of atoms and molecules to form compounds.
No?
Chemical bonds are what make matter matter.
Bonds are what hold the physical world together.
What hold us together.
Yeah. Yeah. No, I got it.
Bonds.
Your test score says otherwise. It tells me you don't get it at all.
Yeah, but, I mean, 58. I was close.
What is "close"?
There's no "close" in science, Barry.
There are right answers and wrong answers.
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.
Yeah, but I'm just saying, Mr. White, two points?
Look, if I don't pass chemistry, I have to go to summer school.
And, I mean, I really studied. Like, really, really studied.
Like, all night, hard.
And, I mean, I'm so into chemistry for, like, the concepts.
I just think I might have, you know, the attention deficit...
Couldn't you please just let this slide?
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.
The answer is no. Next time, apply yourself.
<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>
Are you ducking me, or what? This makes the third time.
Look, I will be leaving this phone on for another 15 minutes, so call me.
Oh, and by the way, that thing we talked about, the...
When I said, "Handle it."
Well, don't. Just let it go.
All right.
Come on.
Jesse, open the door.
I know you're home. Your car is here. Come on. Hey.
Can I help you?
No. Thank you.
Well, I'm the manager, so can we stop with the pounding, please?
You're the manager?
Yes. Yes, you can help me. Absolutely.
I very much need to get inside here, so if you have a master key...
You have a key, right?
Yeah, I have a key.
Look, the person who lives here...
...it's just very important for me to see him.
And you knocked, right?
Yeah.
He didn't answer?
Which means...?
Look, I'm his father, all right?
You're Mr. Jackson?
Yes. That's me. Walt Jackson.
And you are...?
Jane.
Jane. Very nice to meet you, Jane.
Now, if you wouldn't mind...
Mr. Jackson, I'm happy to let you use my phone.
Wanna call him?
No.
No. I--
As I said, I would like if you let me inside here...
...so that I can check on my son's well-being.
You understand?
Look, whatever's going on between the two of you is family.
I don't get involved in family.
Jesse doesn't want you in, you're not getting in.
Period.
Sorry.
Come on in, Dad.
Thanks.
You okay?
Yeah.
"Jesse Jackson"?
Do you even...?
Oh, I see you have a telephone, at least.
You know, that blinking thing I've been calling you on?
Whatever, man.
Hey, give me my-- Give--
I will break this. I will break this!
Damned druggie idiot. Is this what you've been doing...
...the whole time I've been trying to reach you?
No. I've been taking care of business.
What business?
What business?
The business you put me on, asshole. What, you already forgot?
This business.
Does that jog your memory? Son of a bitch.
You didn't actually--?
Hey, you said--
You said, "Handle it," so, you know, I handled it.
When I said, "Handle it," I meant fear and intimidation.
I meant get your money back. I never meant--
Oh, didn't mean to kill somebody?
No!
Well, too late, yo, because dude's dead.
Oh, God.
All right? Way dead.
Oh, God.
Oh, and, hey, hey, hey. Here.
Here's your money.
Yeah, 4660 bucks. Your half.
Spend it in good health, you miserable son of a bitch.
I didn't say I killed him.
Tell me what happened.
Dude's wife crushed his head with an ATM machine.
Crushed his--?
Crushed his head...
...with an ATM machine right in front of me.
I mean, crushed it like...
Oh, my God, the sound...
...it's still in my ears.
You know, and the blood, like, everywhere.
Like, there was so much, you would not believe.
Man, will you just please give me--? Just give me my weed, all right?
It helps with my nausea.
So...
...you did not kill anyone?
Does anybody think that you killed anybody?
I called the cops.
You called the cops?
Yeah. You know, I called, and I split, you know?
And then they came in and busted her.
God, she was-- She was so zapped out of her mind.
You know? It's... She did it for, like, nothing.
I mean, he told her she was a skank, but, yo, I mean, she was a skank.
Can this person identify you? Can she identify you being there?
She couldn't identify her left ass cheek.
She was so zonked.
And she had this...
God, she had this kid.
Listen, I'm a little fuzzy on the mechanics here...
...but could you not stop this woman from killing this man?
Look, she had a gun on me, all right?
Yeah, my gun, okay? Mine.
Go ahead, say it. Say it.
No, I ain't no Tuco or Krazy-8. I can't run a crew.
Come on. Come on. Point made, man. Point made. Yes.
<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>
<i>- Hey, it's Badger, man.
What are you doing?</i>
<i>- Don't use your real name.
What? That isn't my real name.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Yo, we got those pants you wanted. Thirty-two large, right?</i>
<i>We got them just for you, jefe.</i>
<i>Let's do some business, yo.</i>
So are you gonna get back up on that horse?
No.
You get on. All right?
I just want to forget. I just...
Sorry.
Hey.
Hey, what's up with that?

Well, yeah, hell, I know who it is, okay?
Scumbags kneeling down praying to him:
"Please, SeÃ±or Saint. No DEA, please."
I'm just-- I'm just saying, why's he on your desk?
Going after neo-Nazis, you don't wear swastikas, right?
Sun Tzu.
Son who?
<i>Sixth-century Chinese general. Wrote The Art of War.</i>
"If you know your enemy as yourself...
...you'll fight without danger in many battles."
Right on.
Agent Schrader.
Sir.
Glad to have you on board.
Thanks.
Everybody getting you settled in?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Great group of guys.
And gals. And gals. Guys-- Guys and gals.
Good. You couldn't have picked a better time to arrive.
We're about to put a big dent in the cartel. Right, Vanco?
Yes, sir.
Yo, bro, check it out. It's a satellite picture of you farting.
"Fat Man and Little Boy." Sounds like you two.
I got your fat man in my pants, bitch.
Hey, watch it.
It ain't real, dumb-ass.
Just watch it, is all.
You watch it.
I'm Heisenberg.
You're Heisenberg?
Yeah, I remember you. You were the cook.
Let's get this over with.
Where's Jesse?
Busy.
Hey, that's cool.
Real cool.
Totally cool.
Hey, hey--
It's all there, man. Every dollar. Case you wanna, like, count it.
Here?
I'm just saying...
Just saying, like, we cool, yo.
Ain't got no confusions and interpretations...
...as to who we work for.
And that's church, yo. For real.
What have you heard?
Did Jesse really...?
I mean, did he really...
...squash that dude's head with an ATM machine?
Word.
Who's saying that?
Damn, man, it's all over town. Everybody's like, "Whoa, snap."
Usually I gotta chase dudes down for their money...
...but today everybody's paying up.
True that. Serious.
But, like...
He really did it?
You didn't hear that from me.
Big lunch.
Thank you.
Here you go.
Very good, Ms. White.
We'll consider your application and let you know.
Thank you.
I'd just like to mention that I have worked here before.
Really?
When are you due?
Several months.
Congratulations.
I see. Accounting Department. You left us four years ago?
Family.
We'll definitely let you know. Thank you for coming by.
Actually, may I see Ted Beneke? I-- I think he'll remember me.
Mr. Beneke's very busy today, unfortunately.
You know, if it's okay, I'll just--
Ma'am--
Skyler. Oh, my God, look at you.
Hey, Ted.
Come in, come in.
Okay.
No calls, Margaret, thanks.
Come on, sit down right here.
Okay. Thank you.
You look great.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Boy or girl? Or are you keeping it a secret?
Oh, it's a little girl. We're very excited.
I'll bet. One of each.
How's Walt Jr.?
Oh, 10th grade, and he's just growing like a weed.
He's-- He's taller than I am now.
Yeah. I'm betting 6'3 ", 6'4" by the time he's finished.
And, wow, handsome. Oh, my God.
Good genes.
Speaking of movie stars, those can't be the twins.
Oh, yeah. Yep. That's them.
They're gorgeous.
Yes, they are.
And they know it.
I'm in real trouble there, huh?
Yeah.
So the big office, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Weird, isn't it?
I still think of it as my dad's.
I miss him.
Me too.
I'd like to think he'd be proud. Last year was our best year yet.
Yeah, he'd be proud.
Walt? How's he doing?
Oh, he's-- He is doing great. Yeah. He's plugging away.
Great. He's still teaching?
Yeah.
You tell him I said hello.
I will definitely do that.
To be honest, Ted, I didn't just stop by to say hello. I...
I was applying for the data-entry job.
You're kidding.
Skyler, you were, like, our go-to bookkeeper.
Yeah. Well...
...the economy, you know, so...
Well, you, data entry? That'd be a mistake.
How about...
...get your old job back?
We're expanding, and, well, between you and me...
...the whole department's pretty much of a mess.
Your work would be cut out for you...
...but we could use your help.
Okay.
All right. Now, this is our territory, right? Currently.
Hey. Hello.
Yeah, man. Current. Whatever.
Now, look at this.
Here, here, here and here.
What does that look like to you?
Opportunities. Golden ones. That's what that looks like.
No, look. Look, it's an entire city full of buyers.
Now, why aren't we exploiting that?
Because it's not our territory?
Because we lack initiative.
Initiative.
Yes.
You need to employ more dealers.
Double, triple your crew. Those three I met?
They should each have three, six, nine sub-dealers working for them.
Exponential growth, that's the key here.
It's not our territory, man. Yo, you follow me here, huh?
We go rolling into these neighbourhoods...
...other crews ain't gonna take kindly, you understand?
Sure, they won't like it...
...but I say they're not gonna do a thing about it.
No. Listen, Jesse--
No.
Jesse.
The game has changed. The word is out that you are a killer.
What are you talking about?
Apparently, it's all over town.
Somebody crossed you, you got angry...
...you crushed their skull with an ATM machine.
That's not how it happened.
Who cares...
...as long as it's our competitors who believe it and not the police?
Oh, my--
No, don't you see how great this is?
Look, you-- You are a...
Jesse, look at me.
You are a blowfish.
What?
A blowfish. Think about it.
Small in stature, not swift, not cunning.
Easy prey for predators...
...but the blowfish has a secret weapon...
...doesn't he? Doesn't he?
What does the blowfish do, Jesse? What does the blowfish do?
I don't even know--
The blowfish puffs up.
The blowfish puffs himself up four, five times larger than normal.
And why? Why does he do that?
So that it makes him intimidating, that's why.
Intimidating.
So that the other scarier fish are scared off.
And that's you. You are a blowfish.
You see, it's just all an illusion.
You see, it's nothing but air.
Now...
...who messes with the blowfish, Jesse?
Nobody.
You're damn right.
I'm a blowfish.
You are a blowfish.
Say it again.
I'm a blowfish.
Say it like you mean it.
I'm a blowfish.
You're a blowfish. That's right.
Yeah!
Blowfishing this up.
Hello?
<i>The SkyMall. Give me the SkyMall, would you?</i>
Vanco...
...new guy don't speak Spanish. What's up?
Hey, white boy, better learn EspaÃ±ol, huh?
This ain't Branson, Missouri, know what I'm talking about?
You know what? I'll teach you.
It means, "Let's make a deal."
So go ahead. We're waiting.
Okay.
Right here.
"Item SS4G:
Yankee Stadium final season commemorative baseball...
...hand-signed by Derek Jeter."
Vanco, write this down.
Oh, man, watch out.
"66100ZBG: large-size floor runner."
Look at that, huh? It's a rug you put on the floor...
...except for it looks like a hundred-dollar bill.
<i>I love them. Get me 20 of them. I'm gonna put them all over my casa.</i>
We'll get you three.
No, you give me 10.
Five.
Hey. How about you stop jerking us off here?
Where's the meet? When's it going down?
White boy don't like let's make a deal, huh?
White boy's gonna kick your ass, you don't stop wasting time.
Schrader...
Hey, white boy. My name's Tortuga. You know what that means?
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole."
Tortuga means "turtle." That's me.
I take my time, but I always win.
Oh, wait. That reminds me.
I seen this earlier. Lookit.
This is awesome, homes. Right there, look at that.
"The tranquil tortoise garden sculpture."
Definitely two of those, huh?
Check it out, huh? Good likeness.
Hank's doing great down there. He's making inroads.
I'm sure he is. He's a hero, after all.
So you gonna go down to El Paso?
Please. It's Third World enough around here.
They keep him busy every second.
He's already got some big operation going.
Some hush-hush deal he couldn't tell me about...
...except it's on the other side of the border.
Wow, that sounds exciting.
He's being safe, right?
Yeah. He says he's mostly riding a desk.
Which, between you and me, is just the way I want it.
Speaking of riding desks...
...got myself a job today.
You did not.
As big as you are?
Thank you.
You know I just mean...
Where? With who?
Well, someone willing to work around that, apparently.
Beneke.
You did not. Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?
Marie, that was one time at a Christmas party.
And he was so drunk, he was practically slurring his words.
Just what you want in an executive.
And he apologised profusely.
Plus he's married with a family. I'm sure he doesn't wanna get sued.
It will not happen again.
Is money that tight?
Yeah.
You know we can always help out.
No, Marie.
You know Walt. He would just...
Speak of the devil.
Hey. Hi, Marie.
How are you? What's up?
Nothing much. How's things with you?
Good. Good.
Hi, honey.
Dinner will be about an hour and--
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Everything okay?
Everything's perfect.
This is Raisin Bran, not Raisin Bran Crunch.
So? Same thing.
Not the same thing.
I'll tell you what, why don't you do the grocery shopping?
And then you can get whatever you want. Great.
It's-- It's not that hard, Mom. It says "crunch" on the box.
You're pushing it.
Morning.
Morning, honey.
Hey, Dad.
Hey.
Dad, notice anything?
Is there a funeral today?
A funeral?
Well--
Oh, Christ, do I look that bad?
No, no, no.
Mom got a job.
A job? Why?
Well, do I need to get out the chequebook and show you?
No, I... Do you think it's a good idea in your condition?
No, no. The doctor said I can work up until I go into labour.
And it's just an office job. I'm just sitting on my butt.
Where?
Beneke.
I'm back working in the Accounting Department.
Skyler, what about the welding fumes? Isn't that why you had to quit...
...in the first place?
They've gone green since then.
They have some kind of green welding or something.
I didn't smell anything when I was in there.
Didn't Mr. Beneke pass away?
Yeah.
Who's running things?
Ted. The son.
Anyway, I have got to go.
I don't wanna be late my first day back.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Okay.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Bye.
Hey.
You left your cave.
Yeah.
I was-- I'm missing my TV.
Thinking maybe I'd hit Costco.
You know, snag a big-ass wide-screen.
So...
Yeah.
What you drawing?
Damn.
That's good.
Make a hell of a tat.
That's the plan.
Really?
I work part-time, down at ABQ Ink.
Right on.
Yo, you're a real good drawer.
I used to do a little of that.
You used to be a drawer too, huh?
What stopped you?
You know, just...
So tell me something.
What kind of tattoo artist has no tattoos?
That's way too big a commitment.
Hey, man. You're Pinkman.
You're the man! Everybody's been talking about you.
Yeah.
Right on, man. Keep it real.
"Pinkman," huh?
Yeah.
I thought your name was "Jackson."
Well, your snitch is really earning his nickname.
Are we...?
Are we just on maÃ±ana time?
They'll show.
Yeah? Why is that?
You got more catalogues for him to clean out?
Maybe a little Sharper Image or Pottery Barn?
What the hell are they thinking?
Sending us some loudmouth who doesn't speak the language?
Politics, man. Politics.
Supposed to be some hotshot hero. I say it's a bunch of crap.
Hero for Albuquerque, maybe. Maybe it don't take much up there.
Hey, something I need to know about?
What? Oh, that? No, man.
We were just singing your praises.
Glad to have you.
Welcome aboard.
Hey, is that your guy?
Hey, I think that's your guy.
What the hell is he doing down there?
Schrader, where you going?
We need an evidence bag, right? A pretty big one.
What's the matter? You act like you never saw...
...a severed human head on a tortoise before.
Hey, welcome to--
My leg.
<i>- -Headed by Werner Heisenberg, were also undertaken during the war.</i>
The game has changed, yo.
This is our city, all right?
All of it. The whole damn place.
Our territory.
We're staking our claim...
...that we sell when we want, where we want.
Now, we're gonna be kings, understand?
Well, I'm gonna be king.
You guys will be princes or dukes or something.
I wanna be a knight.
But first things first.
We gotta get more dealers.
You know, foot soldiers, right?
Now, they'll be working for you.
You're working for me, and they're working for you.
You follow me?
Layered, like nachos.
Exponential growth.
Now, that's success with a capital S.
Straight up, straight up.
For shizzle.
Frigging awesome.
Well, we're set.
Our boys are ready. Gonna be some mad cheddar, yo.
Cheddar, Mr. White.
Fat stacks, dead presidents, cash money.
Gonna own this city.
We're not charging enough.
What?
You corner the market, then raise the price.
Simple economics.
Oh, hey, Ted. Come on in.
Looks like they got you all set up.
Yeah. It's perfect.
I am close enough to the bathroom that I don't have to waddle far.
And that's very nice.
I figured that might be a deal-breaker.
Yeah.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you for having me back.
You don't have to thank me. I need you.
Wow, Ted, it's a little early for wine, isn't it?
Oh, damn. It's grape juice.
Been making the girls breakfast in the morning.
Hey, how is Denise doing?
We split up, about a year ago.
I'm sorry.
She's definitely happier now. I guess I am too, most days.
Together since high school.
Yeah.
I remember that.
Anyway...
I don't know, people change.
Yes.
Anyway, I just wanted to welcome you.
Welcome you back. And...
I'll see you around the vending machines.
Okay.
We should have lunch one day.
Like old times.
Sure.
Oh, hey.
Hey, yourself.
So listen. My...
My name is not really Jesse Jackson.
It's Jesse Pinkman.
And that guy you met...
...he's not my dad.
You're not gonna kick me out, are you?
Because I actually really like it here.
I don't make it my business what you do.
So long as you don't do it here.
So, hey, I got this kick-ass new flat-screen.
Wanna see?
It's got that thing where the blacks...
...are, like, you know, really, really, really black.
And the Dolby six-point-whatever.
So it'll really rock the house.
But I'll, you know...
I'll keep it way down, of course.
I don't know what the hell is taking so long.
Come on, come on.
ï»¿1
Hey.
You...
You selling?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay. That's cool.
I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling...
...I could maybe do with a teenth.
You're kidding, right?
Dude, I so smell bacon.
What? What are you talking about?
Oh, gee, I don't know.
How about over there. That brown van.
That's yours, right?
What brown van?
Parked all inconspicuous.
It's a cop van.
Yeah, another one right over there.
"Duke City Flowers"? Come on.
Can't you at least be original?
Dude, I just wanna get high.
A flower van.
You know what you should do is a garbage truck.
Seriously, and I don't mean to disrespect...
...but if you put cops in the back of a garbage truck...
...there's no way I'm seriously thinking...
...that there's cops in the back of a garbage truck.
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.
Think about it, boys.
All right. I'm hitting it.
You dudes give up that easy?
I'm not a cop.
Then lift your shirt. Show me you're not wearing a wire.
All right, you know what?
Just to show you you're being an asshole.
I'm blinded by white.
Douchebag.
Come on. I was joking. Come on.
Don't walk away angry. Sit down. Come on.
I mean, what are you complaining about?
You got abs, man. Kind of.
Whatever, dude.
I'm not even sure I wanna buy anymore.
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Come on. Don't be like that.
I just need you to prove it, you know?
Prove you're not a cop.
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
Hey, I got it. Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.
Which dude?
That dude?
Yeah.
No way. He'd kick my ass.
True that.
This is so hard, you know?
Yeah.
I know.
It's simple.
If you ask a cop if he's a cop, he's, like, obligated to tell you.
It's in the Constitution.
Constitution of America?
So go ahead and ask.
You a cop?
No, no. Not like that.
Ask it, like, official.
Are you a police officer?
No, I am not a police officer.
Okay, then. Hundred and seventy-five for a teenth.
The price is the price, yo.
All right.
There you go. Enjoy.
Thanks, man.
Albuquerque Police! You're under arrest! Get on the ground!
Get on your stomach now! On your stomach! Get on the ground!
Hold it right there. Don't move. Stay down.
<i>I had a good job until my boss accused me of stealing.</i>
<i>I'd better call Saul!</i>
<i>I was out partying, minding my own business...</i>
<i>- You are under arrest.
I'd better call Saul!</i>
<i>Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.</i>
<i>Did you know that you have rights?</i>
<i>The Constitution says you do. And so do I.</i>
<i>I believe that until proven guilty...</i>
<i>...every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent.</i>
<i>And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque.</i>
<i>Better call Saul.</i>
<i>Saul Goodman, attorney at law, 505-164-CALL.</i>
<i>That's 505-164-CALL.</i>
I really need to get some furniture.
I suggest you start with a bed.
God, I wish we could smoke in here.
Well, you can't.
Yeah, no. I know.
I'm just saying.
Don't think I can't smell that weed.
You better seriously hope that airs out.
My dad will keep your security deposit.
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.
Yeah?
Has he ever caught you?
Yeah. Many times.
Well, listen.
Since I already lost my deposit and all...
...maybe we should light up.
No, thanks.
You sure?
Well, is it cool if I burn one?
Maybe you'll change your mind.
Do what you wanna do, I guess.
Hey. What'd I say?
Nothing.
I just have to go is all.
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
And, you know, pot is like stepping stones.
Recovery? That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
You know, I don't really burn much anymore.
It's just a sometime thing.
But no more, like, in the house.
So you wanna go grab some dinner?
I could really go for some Chinese.
No, I better hit it.
We...
We cool?
Your satellite is on, by the way.
That screen is badass.
I just think it's asking a lot.
He knows it.
He's done nothing but apologise.
Is this gonna be every weekend now?
No. It's just the end of the quarter. You remember how that was.
But I am earning double time, so there's a bright side.
So when the laziest boy in the world wakes up...
...tell him he better wash those sneakers.
And I said bye.
And tell him to let them air-dry this time.
I don't want him banging the hell out of my dryer.
What?
What, you don't even get casual Saturday?
I mean...
No, it's just you...
You look nice is all.
It's work, Walt. And everybody is gonna be there.
Okay.
Okay.
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
<i>Hi. You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>
<i>Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you.</i>
<i>Skyler? Are you there? I don't know what to do.</i>
<i>I... I need to talk to you. I...</i>
Hey, Marie. It's me. What's up?
Yesterday I got home and found him.
He didn't even tell me he was coming.
A man was killed?
A Federale, right in front of him.
Three agents wounded, one lost his leg.
It's like what you hear about from Iraq or something.
The IEDs.
Oh, Jesus.
I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.
Hank talked to his ASAC for about an hour.
Hank could win an Oscar. He's so damn breezy with the man.
He hangs up the phone, goes right back to bed.
And all he keeps saying is, "I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."
Baby, not now.
It's-- It's me, Hank. Sorry.
Hey, buddy. What's...?
What's up?
I just...
Do you mind if I...?
No. No.
So...
How you doing?
Oh, you know, lousy.
Montezuma's revenge, bigtime.
I mean, everything's going through me like crap through a tinhorn.
Better not get too close.
Well, I'll take my chances.
I guess you heard about what happened down in JuÃ¡rez?
Terrible.
What do you expect? Bunch of freaking animals.
<i>It's like Apocalypse Now down there.</i>
It's like Colonel Kurtz holed up in his jungle.
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.
Now, that's a sound leadership decision right there, huh?
You know, you don't put your second most senior man...
...on the trail of those motherless bastards...
...you send him home. You know?
I was, you know-- "He's out getting an evidence bag...
...and so ends up without a scratch on him.
So must be something wrong with that picture, you know."
So are you home for good then?
No, no. It's...
Playing it by ear. To be determined.
Think you might wanna talk it through with somebody?
What, a shrink? No, no, no. Can't go down that road.
Start going down that road, kiss your career goodbye.
Or Marie. Or me, if you like.
You know, I don't know how to say this. I...
You know, the things I deal with...
...you and me don't have much of a--
What you might call "an experiential overlap."
What if I told you we do?
I have spent my whole life scared.
Frightened of things that could happen...
...might happen, might not happen.
Fifty years I spent like that.
Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.
But you know what?
Ever since my diagnosis...
...I sleep just fine.
Okay.
And I came to realise it's that fear that's the worst of it.
That's the real enemy.
So...
Get up.
Get out in the real world.
And you kick that bastard as hard as you can right in the teeth.
Do it again. Go on.
Ten thousand even, same as last time. It's totally accurate.
You and I, we are gonna feed this machine.
I want it running 24 hours a day.
Right on.
Not yours, I take it.
We got 10, 20, 30...
...44, five each.
Three pounds should be 48 each.
Who's short?
All right. Don't freak, all right? We didn't get ripped off.
But Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.
I know he was planning on pulling an all-nighter...
...so he's probably still in the sack.
Then wake him up. He can sleep after we're paid.
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?
You're not his pal. You're his boss.
This only works when they're scared of you, remember?
Jack-off.
It's going straight to voice-mail.
Voicemail?
Just chill, okay? Count your money.
<i>- Combo.
Yo, what's up?</i>
You seen Badger?
Don't you cover for him, bitch.
I ask you a straight-up question, I expect a straight-up answer.
Well?
They were too scared to tell me.
Badger got busted.
He's in jail.
<i>Honey, I'm home!</i>
Too slow! What's up?
Got more lives than a damn cat.
Now if I could only learn to lick myself.
What's up, guys? Good to see you. Good to see you. Good to see you.
All right. Let's all get back to work, for chrissake, okay?
In my office, man. Let's see what you bozos been up to lately.
You okay?
Hanging in?
What's it look like?
What's this from A.P.D.?
Been checking with them to see...
...if they come across that famous blue meth of yours.
Sure enough, last night.
Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer.
I was thinking of cruising over and saying hello.
Maybe you'd like to go with me?
Yeah. Well, all right.
You told me to my face you weren't a cop, man.
I feel manipulated.
I thought we were gonna hang out.
We are hanging out, Badger.
You like Badger or Brandon?
I like people who don't, like, abuse the Constitution.
Badger, listen.
Hey.
I'm trying to help you here, man.
Now, if you just tell me who your supplier is...
...I think this can end very well for you.
What are you doing, detective, talking to my client without me present?
You sneaky Pete.
Which is which?
What, did the academy hire you right out of the womb?
You guys get younger every--
What'd you say to baby face?
Did you say anything stupid?
By "anything stupid," I mean anything at all.
Look at you. Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter.
We'll talk about it later. Right now, you out.
Ten minutes ago. Go on. There are laws, detective.
Have your kindergarten teacher read them to you.
Go grab a juice box. Have a nap. Go on.
All right.
Who do we have?
Brandon Mayhew.
Brandon Mayhew. All right.
Brandon Mayhew.
Here we go. Public masturbation.
What?
I don't get it. What's the kick? Why don't you do it at home...
...with a big flat-screen TV, 50 channels of pay-per-view?
In a Starbucks. That's nice.
That ain't me, man. I...
I was the guy who was selling meth. Allegedly.
Okay. All right. I got you. Meth. Right.
Sorry, that was a little transpositional error.
Nothing a little Wite-Out can't take care of.
Yeah, and felony quantity.
Just barely.
Yeah, just barely.
The cops are like butchers. Always got their thumbs on the scales.
But good luck arguing that in court.
Let me get down to brass tacks.
I'm gonna get you a second phone call.
You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy...
...or your parish priest or your Boy Scout leader...
...and they're gonna deliver me a cheque for $4650.
I'm gonna write that down on the back of my business card.
Four-six-five-zero. Okay?
And I need that in a cashier's cheque or a money order, doesn't matter.
Actually, I want it in a money order.
And make it out to "Ice Station Zebra Associates."
That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.
It's done just for tax purposes.
And after that, we can discuss Visa or MasterCard...
...but definitely not American Express, so don't even ask. All right?
Any questions?
You're gonna get me off, right?
What do I look like, your high-school girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting?
That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up.
Son, I promise you this.
I will give you the best criminal defence...
...that money can buy.
Yeah, but, Francesca, I took these already.
Didn't I take these already?
It's on your head. You're not supposed to double up on vitamin A.
It's bad for the liver.
Okay, who's next?
Did him. I did him.
That one went public defender. Thanks for nothing.
What happened to my masturbator? You got me all turned around.
Hang on. I'll get back to you.
I sense you're discussing my client. Anything you care to share with me?
Sure. Your commercials? They suck ass.
I've seen better acting in an epileptic whorehouse.
Is that like the one your mom works at?
Is she still offering the two-for-one discount?
DEA, huh? For a street bust.
Now, what would two feds want with that little twerp?
Sooner or later, this was gonna happen.
You want your exponential growth...
...guys are gonna get busted. Simple as that.
How about we get him a real attorney? What the hell is this?
This is who he hires?
What? Are you kidding me? This is the guy you want.
This is the guy I'd hire.
It's the guy you'd hire.
Look, you remember Emilio?
Okay, this dude got Emilio off, like, twice. Okay?
Both times, they had him dead to rights, yo. And then, poof.
Dude is like Houdini.
Seriously, when the going gets tough...
...you don't want a criminal lawyer.
You want a "criminal" lawyer.
Know what I'm saying?
Look, we're in good shape, Mr. White.
Badger is way too loyal to roll.
Plus, he's scared shitless of me, all right.
We pay four large. Cost of business. Take it out of his payroll.
And it's only his first dealing rap...
...so, worst-case scenario, you know, they plead him out.
He does five months picking up litter in an orange jump suit.
So who goes inside? I don't need them seeing my face.
Well, I don't need them seeing my face.
Why not? You look like his typical clientele.
Dick.
Fine.
We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.
Heads.
Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew.
Nice of you to come down. Please.
Look at you.
Should I call the FBI and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?
Joking.
I-- Please, come on.
Come on. Please.
Hello.
Saul Goodman. Please sit.
So it's a shame that we have to meet under these circumstances.
I believe you have something for me?
Oh, yes.
Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?
Irish.
Faith and begorra. A fellow potato-eater.
My real name is McGill.
The Jew thing I just do for the homeboys.
They all want a pipe-hitting member of the tribe, so to speak.
I digress. Good things are happening.
Fact is, your nephew is gonna get out in no time.
That's wonderful, yeah.
There's still a few details to be ironed out...
...but now that the DEA is involved...
...I think he's looking at time served, then probation.
So leave your number with Francesca, and we'll be in touch.
Excuse me, the DEA?
Yeah.
That's the Drug Enforcement Administration. The feds.
I hope that I'm not the breaker of bad news...
...but your nephew got mixed up with some pretty nasty customers.
I understand that.
What does that have to do with the DEA?
They're after some mystery man...
...some heavy-hitter that goes by the name Heisenberg.
They want this guy like the axe wants the turkey.
Seems young Brandon may have information...
...that could lead to his arrest.
Jesus, cheer up. This is good news.
I mean, Brandon fell head-first into the doo-doo pile...
...and came up smelling like Paco Rabanne.
Wait, wait. Look, I just... I think...
I just think that we should review our options.
Options?
I'm gonna tell you what your options are.
You got a grand total of two. Option A: Brandon takes the deal.
Option B: Brandon goes up to the penitentiary...
...and gets his rectum resized about yay big.
Look, look. What about reprisals?
I mean, if Badger--
If Brandon informs on this Heisenberg...
I mean, what if, God forbid...
...that they decide to take revenge?
What have you been telling him?
The kid keeps spouting off about, "If I talk, they'll kill me."
Right now, he's the only thing holding up this deal.
Good.
No, that's not good. That's terrible.
Trust me, sir, your nephew won't last in prison two weeks.
You let him take his chances on the outside.
Maybe I can work in some witness protection.
No, look, look. These are vicious, desperate people.
I've been told that one of them killed another man...
...by crushing his head with an ATM machine.
People love to take credit for the fun ones.
The guy who got his head smooshed used to be a client of mine.
His wife killed him, all right? It was open and shut.
Trust me, you folks have nothing to worry about, okay?
I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary...
...all's right with the world.
Ten thousand dollars.
Ten thousand, cash to you.
I'm not saying to throw the case.
Just no talking to the DEA.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Yes.
What's it going to be?
What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?
That dude in there? Saul Goodman we're talking about?
Yeah. "Morally outraged," he said.
Threatened to call the police.
<i>- Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
Like the Exxon Valdez.</i>
So, what do we do about it?
Hey, Francesca, how about I follow you home?
No.
For safety.
What?
God, you are killing me with that booty.
Talk to me. Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?
Come on, just tell me what you want. Jesus!
Oh, no, no, no!
No, it wasn't me. It was Ignacio. He's the one.
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.
Shut up, dude.
Shut up, all right? Just speak English.
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?
Who?
Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ!
Oh, I thought...
What can I do for you gentlemen?
Anything. Just tell me what you need.
This afternoon, an associate of ours offered you $10,000.
You should have taken it.
Wait a minute. This is in regards to what's-his-name?
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.
The uncle. That was your guy?
No of fence, but I don't take bribes from strangers, you know?
Better safe than sorry. That's my motto.
But I'll take your money! Sure!
No, that offer has expired, yo.
It was kind of low anyways. But okay, okay, I'll take it.
Just tell me what you need, all right?
I'm easy. I'm gonna keep a happy thought...
...and assume this is just a negotiating tactic.
All right, listen to me very carefully.
You are going to give Badger Mayhew...
...the best legal representation ever.
But no deals with the DEA.
All right? Badger will not identify anyone to anybody.
If he does, you're dead.
Why don't you just kill Badger?
I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito is buzzing around you...
...and it bites you on the ass, you don't go gunning for the attorney.
You go grab a fly swatter. I mean, so to speak.
I mean, all due respect, but do I have to spell this out for you?
We're not killing Badger, yo!
Then you got real problems, okay.
Because the DEA will come down on your boy...
...like a proverbial ton of bricks.
I don't think I'm going out on a limb here...
...but, hey, he's not gonna like prison.
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion regardless of what you do to me.
Mr. Mayhew?
I recognise your cough. Take that mask off, you know. Get some air.
Go on.
God.
Take it easy.
Breathe in, breathe out.
All right. I'm gonna stand up, all right? Because I got bad knees.
That's better.
Okay, now listen. The three of us are gonna work this out.
Yeah? How?
First thing, you'll put a dollar in my pocket, both of you.
You want attorney-client privilege, don't you?
So that everything you say is strictly between us.
I mean it. Put a dollar in my pocket.
Come on, make it official.
Come on, do it.
That's it, come on. Just a dollar.
All right, now you, ski bum. Come on. Give with the dollar.
Go on.
Be smart.
What?
All I got is a five.
I'll take a five.
Come on, already. Come on. Be cool.
Okay, you're now both officially represented...
...by Saul Goodman and Associates.
Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment. All right?
Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm talking to the Weather Underground.
Just do it.
Okay, so if a prison shanking is completely off the table...
And we're sure of that?
No shanking!
All right, all right.
The way I see it is somebody is going to prison.
It's just a matter of who.
All right. Lame-ass TV ads aside...
...your lawyer here, he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.
Time served, no probation.
It's pretty slick. Couldn't believe the judge went for it.
Don't get cocky. You ain't home free yet.
You don't give us the name of your supplier...
...you're going nowhere.
The tough guy act is unnecessary.
This young man is cooperating fully.
Is that right? Yeah, you cooperating?
Okay, let's start with a name.
He just goes by Heisenberg.
Heisenberg, huh?
How old is this Heisenberg?
Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.
Height?
Average, I guess.
Medium height, medium weight.
What colour hair?
No hair.
Dude is balder than you.
1963, James Edward Kilkelly...
...is convicted of stealing a vending machine.
1975, breaking and entering.
1982, grand theft auto.
1984, armed robbery.
1987, 1992. You get the idea. And here he is today.
Better known as Jimmy In-'N-Out.
City, state and federal, he's spent 44 of the last 58 years inside.
Entire life behind bars.
Jimmy provides a very special service.
For a price, Jimmy will go to prison for you.
On purpose? The guy goes to prison on purpose?
He's actually more comfortable inside.
The outside world hasn't been too kind to him.
Sometime during the Clinton administration...
...Jimmy figured out how he could use his talents to turn a profit.
So when does all this happen?
It's already happening.
The buy is set for tomorrow.
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out, everybody's happy...
...and all it's gonna cost you is 80 thousand and one pound...
...of your finest meth.
Eighty thousand dollars for eight years of his life, huh?
First of all, he's not gonna do eight years.
I'll represent him, and I guarantee...
...there's gonna be some unexpected problems with the prosecution's case.
Secondly, he gets 30. Fifty goes to me.
You get 50? For what?
For facilitating.
Who's taking a bigger risk here? He likes prison.
You did bring the cash, didn't you?
Look, if this option is too expensive...
...you can still always... Badger in the chow line.
Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?
All right. There's our boy.
Right on time.
Go back.
What? All right, all right, all right.
So, what do you think? They see us?
No, man, I think we're good.
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me.
Oh, no.
Where the hell is Jimmy?
Should've been here 10 minutes ago.
You think Jimmy is actually for real? A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is-- Wait a minute.
Oh, no, no, no.
What? What? Let me see.
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.
Time to move?
Not till we see the exchange.
No, no. Oh, shit!
What?
Now he shows.
Okay, let's do this.
No, no.
Oh, my God. Jimmy is on the wrong bench. Crap!
We're screwed!
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?
I don't get it. What's the holdup?
Where's the stuff, man?
Where are we going?
Just shut up.
Get out. Go stop him.
The DEA is right there. If they see me, we're screwed.
Get out. I'll do something.
What?
Just go!
Hank, I thought that was you.
Schrader, I'm blocked.
Walt, not a good time.
How you doing? You feeling okay?
Schrader, I'm blocked.
We're working. You gotta get out of here.
Working? Oh, like DEA working?
Schrader, we're missing it. Schrader.
Is something going down?
Wrong guy, wrong guy. Other bench.
Walt, Walt.
Walter, move your ass now.
Okay.
Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone.
We'll talk about it later. Just floor it.
Should I back up?
Go that way.
Forward is better?
I'll be out of the way there. Okay, okay.
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.
I'll leave you alone.
We'll talk later. Just go.
Where'd he go? Where the hell did he go?
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Got him.
Looks like it's going down.
Take him.
Freeze! Hey, right there. Don't move.
Come on, let's get him up.
Jesus!
I think they bought it.
<i>Absolutely.</i>
Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir.
Looks like we got a full pound of the blue stuff.
Oh, and Heisenberg's real name? James Kilkelly.
Thank you. Thank you very much. It was my pleasure.
Hey.
You weren't home, so I let the delivery guys in.
I hope that's okay.
Absolutely.
So you bought a bed.
Yeah.
What is that, a king?
Pillow top?
Oh, my God. You really are a chemistry teacher.
You mind?
I was terrible at chemistry.
I'm more of a humanities guy.
How did you find me?
We should talk about that.
It should be much, much harder for people to track you down.
My Pl charged me for three hours...
...so I seriously doubt it took him more than one.
So this is, what, blackmail?
Walter, I'm your lawyer.
Anything you say to me is totally privileged.
I'm not in the shakedown racket.
I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers need lawyers, right?
Especially drug dealers.
So, what, you're just doing this out of the kindness of your heart?
Come on. Have you seen my hourly rate?
By the way, where do you keep the money?
Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar buried in the side yard?
This kid Mayhew may be the first of your guys to get picked up...
...but he won't be the last.
And if I can find you, how far behind can the cops be?
I don't understand.
What exactly are you offering to do for me?
What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?
I'm no Vito Corleone.
No shit. Right now, you're Fredo.
But with some sound advice...
...and the proper introductions, who knows?
I'll tell you, you've got the right product.
Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big a bunch...
...you're on to something special.
And I would like to be a small and silent part of it.
Food for thought, yeah?
So if you wanna make more money and keep the money that you make...
...better call Saul!
ï»¿1
These people.
Pathetic.
I already read that one anyway.
Kleinman has better magazines.
You know, you guys really don't need to hang around.
We won't even get the results till next week.
Buddy, we're gonna be here. You kidding me?
<i>It is a full PETICT, correct?</i>
<i>You definitely want the PETICT and not just the PET.</i>
<i>Yeah, it's a PETICT.</i>
Good. That's what you want.
Some places skimp and they only do the PET.
I'm not naming any names.
I just still don't understand why you don't go to Kleinman.
This is where Walt's doctor is.
Well, with us, you wouldn't have to wait until next week...
...to get the results.
I'm sorry, but these scans are not that difficult to read.
I could take one look at Walt's...
...and tell you immediately how he's doing.
Really.
Doctors like people to think...
...that they're so much smarter than the technicians...
...but you would be surprised how much they come to us for input.
Well, never turn down a chance to hit the bathroom, huh?
Excuse me.
You all right in there?
Yeah.
Hey, you okay?
Yes.
I'm fine, thank you.
Sir, you can go back to your changing room and get dressed.
So how'd we do?
You did fine.
See anything?
I'm just a technician, Mr. White.
Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results with you next week.
Sorry.
Actually, the money-laundering aspect is fairly straightforward.
But I gotta tell you, the not-telling-your-wife aspect?
Most people wanna know why they suddenly got rich.
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.
How much time they giving you?
Weeks.
Maybe.
Sorry to hear it.
I was hoping we could make some real money together.
Oh, well. Look, let's crunch some numbers.
How much money are we laundering?
At this time, $16,000.
How long you been doing this?
We've had some extenuating circumstances.
Yeah, apparently.
All right, 16,000 laundered at 75 cents on the dollar...
...minus my fee, which is 17 percent...
...comes to $9960.
Congratulations, you just left your family a secondhand Subaru.
Well, we'll just have to cook more. A lot more.
Yeah, that's my legal opinion.
Make hay while the sun is still shining.
You know, we should do something this weekend.
You know, get our minds off the test results.
Actually, I...
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.
Really?
Yeah.
You know, I never did call her.
You're expecting the news from the scan to be bad.
God, Walt.
I need you to stay positive with me here.
I am. Positive is good.
I'm all for positive...
...but positive doesn't change facts, all right?
It...
It doesn't change the need to be prepared.
I know.
Walt, I'm just trying to be hopeful, okay?
You know, forgive me.
Look...
...I need to know Mom's going to leave you something if--
If...
...I'm no longer around.
I just need to get that straight, that's all.
And believe me, I'm gonna earn every penny of it too.
Complaining about her nurses the entire time.
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."
A 30-minute discourse...
...about how the sugar packets are suddenly disappearing.
And, oh, she's counting every one of them, you know.
I'll be lucky if I get a word in edgewise.
I actually think the news from the scan is gonna be good.
Perhaps you should prepare for that.
Yeah.
We should do something.
Yeah, we should.
No, something else.
We should go somewhere.
Have you been to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?
Is that the one with the A-bombs?
Georgia O'Keeffe.
She's a painter.
You've never heard of Georgia O'Keeffe?
No, is that bad?
Boy, you need some educating.
Yes, yes, I do. Come here.
Why don't we go up to Santa Fe? We'll make a day of it.
You wanna go all the way to Santa Fe for a museum?
So romantic.
Yup, we're going. Get up.
Why can't we just go to the movies or putt-putt?
It's the shit.
A little culture won't kill you.
Besides, you might like it. A lot of her paintings look like vaginae.
Really?
Is there still cereal?
Yeah.
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>
<i>Where the hell are you? Pick up the phone.</i>
<i>- Hello? Jesse, pick up--
Hold on, hold on.</i>
Sorry, one sec.
<i>- What?
I've been trying to reach you.</i>
Where's your drop phone?
<i>- I've been busy.
Well, clear your social calendar.</i>
<i>- We have to cook.
What? Today?</i>
<i>No, you'll need today at least to gather supplies.</i>
<i>Now, we're going to need all new glassware...</i>
...heating mantles, about a hundred pounds of ice.
Do you have a paper and pencil? You should be writing this down.
You wanna go shopping, go do it yourself, all right? I got plans.
<i>Smoking marijuana, eating Cheetos and masturbating...</i>
...do not constitute plans in my book.
<i>Well, screw you and your book, man, all right?</i>
I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe, not like you need to know.
You're going to a museum, huh?
Yeah. Georgia O'Keeffe.
<i>- Georgia O'Keeffe?
She's a painter, duh.</i>
She does these vagina pictures.
Or paintings, or just painted. I don't know.
What are you even talking about?
Look, man, why am I even explaining myself to you, all right?
It's none of your damn business what I'm doing.
All you need to know is I ain't cooking or shopping or whatever the hell.
Let me explain something to you.
You and I need to cook through to next Tuesday.
Tuesday? Four days straight?
Like it or not, we have no choice.
<i>Yeah? And why exactly is that?</i>
Our methylamine. It's going bad.
<i>- What?
It's losing its chemical potency.</i>
Now, unless stealing another barrel sounds good to you...
<i>Hell, no.</i>
All right, we have to act fast, before it goes to waste.
<i>You have a paper and pencil?</i>
<i>- Come on.
All right, all right. Go.</i>
Okay, six mantles. Mantle? Mantle?
What do you mean, mantle? You mean like Mickey?
I really wish you didn't have to do this.
Me too.
But I'll be back before you know it...
...and you can always call if you need me.
What, and risk talking to your mother? Have to be some emergency.
Love you.
Fly safe, okay?
Okay.
<i>The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading...</i>
<i>...of passengers only.</i>
<i>No parking.</i>
<i>Attention, passengers.: Please maintain visual contact...</i>
<i>...with your personal belongings at all times.</i>
<i>Any bags left unattended will be confiscated...</i>
<i>...by airport personnel.</i>
You brought a meth lab to the airport?
What? You said we were in a hurry. I saved us a trip.
Yeah. Did you get everything? All six?
Yeah.
With reflux condensers?
Yes. Like I said, yes.
Just go. Drive. Go, go.
Okay.
Good morning to you too, man.
Stupid--
Three entire bags of Funyuns?
What? Funyuns are awesome.
God.
Hey, more for me.
How about something with some protein maybe?
Something green, huh?
Man, I'm getting no service.
How are you even alive?
Hey, yo, check your phone. You get any bars?
Yeah, I've got a signal.
Hey, let me use yours, would you?
Absolutely not.
I have to assume Skyler checks my phone records.
You know that.
It's not business, all right?
It's personal.
Oh, personal.
What, female?
Maybe.
Absolutely. That's all I need.
Skyler hits redial and some stripper answers.
Look, she's not a stripper, okay? Dickwad.
Sorry. My wife checks.
Drinking water?
Yup.
Is that all we've got?
Ten gallons? What, you plan on taking a bath in it?
Oh, God.
No, not there. That is our workstation.
Oh, our "workstation."
That's right.
Why don't you try to find a place where it won't get lost?
Considering it's our only set...
...and we are a million miles from nowhere.
Why don't you try sticking them up your ass sideways?
Two-point-three-five pounds.
Two-point-three-five.
That's the last of it.
How many total?
Nineteen.
So dollar-wise?
How much?
Well, median weight 2.2 pounds...
...that's 41.8, call that 42 pounds, at...
What are we selling for these days?
Forty a pound.
Forty thousand dollars?
Hey, you said raise the prices.
All right, that's 40 times 42...
...minus distribution charges...
What?
What?
Six hundred seventy-two thousand dollars.
All in?
No.
Each.
Each?
Each.
Six hundred and--?
Seventy-two thousand dollars each.
Each. Yes! Hell, yeah!
Hey, come high, baby. Come on. Yes. Come on.
Yes! Yes!
Well, there goes the generator.
I think that's it for the gas.
Perfect timing, yo.
How do you figure that?
What do you mean?
We're done cooking.
I am not done until this barrel is empty.
Look at this.
I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons of methylamine.
Come on, where's your ambition?
Jesus. Seriously?
We are way ahead of schedule, man, all right?
Plus the genny needs gas, we're almost out of propane...
...and my back is killing me from that piece-of-crap cot.
Come on, can we at least just take the night off?
Look, I don't have to take you back till Tuesday, right?
So we come back tomorrow, strap on the sizzle...
...and glass up the rest.
Come on.
There's gotta be a Denny's out there someplace.
Grand Slam?
Hot shower?
A bed?
Separate rooms.
Yeah, that's a given.
What the hell?
What the...? The battery's dead.
Jesse, back when I asked you to put the keys in a safe place...
...where did you put them?
I left them right here in the ignition.
Son of a bitch.
Whoa, whoa, no, this is not my fault, all right?
The buzzer didn't buzz.
The what?
The buzzer that buzzes when you put the keys in...
...to let you know the battery's on.
I know that. It didn't buzz.
Look, I didn't turn the key or anything, all right?
I'm not stupid. Did you hear the buzzer buzz?
I did not. It's faulty. It's a faulty mechanism.
Is this just a genetic thing with you? Is it congenital?
Did your mother drop you on your head when you were a baby?
The buzzer did not buzz.
And you're the one that made me move the keys.
Yes, I see your point.
Your imbecility being what it is, I should've known to say:
"Jesse, don't leave the keys in the ignition the entire two days."
I wanted to leave them on the counter, bitch.
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.
Jesus.
Okay, just...
All right, so we need to jump the battery somehow.
Okay.
How?
You gonna be okay?
Oh, damn it.
What's it taste like?
Bad, huh?
This is good. This is good. Right here.
Okay. There.
Here. Red to red, black to black.
Positive, negative. All right. Start it up.
What the hell's wrong with this thing?
You have to really pull.
I am.
No, really pull, not like a girl.
You know what? Pull this. I am pulling.
It just needs to warm up a little. All right.
Oh, my God.
Oh, jeez.
Well done, Jesse, as always. Just...
Well done.
God.
Come on, you bitches.
Hear me now.
Damn it.
Stupid.
Okay, now we have to use your phone.
This is ruined. Do you understand? Just ruined.
You hooked it up wrong and blew it up.
No, no, no. That is not what happened.
How do you know?
What I know is that I wasn't the one who dumped out the last of our water.
That's what I know.
There was a fire.
Excuse me for thinking on my feet.
Is that what you were--? You were thinking?
Now that we have identified the problem--
You and thinking, that's the problem.
Look, somebody is going to have to pick us up, all right?
Your wife is not gonna notice one little call.
Mr. White, come on.
God.
All right, look, just make it snappy.
Roaming drains the battery.
All right.
Yo, Skinny, hey.
Yeah, yeah. Listen, man, I need you to come pick us up.
Now, all right? We're stuck out here. You got a pen for directions?
Look, pencil's fine, retard.
Just something to write with. It doesn't matter.
All right, so you ready?
All right, so you're gonna head west on the 40 for like, what, 30 miles?
And you're gonna go past the casino with the big arrows in the parking lot.
All right-- No, big arrows, giant arrows.
They light up and blink. You can't miss them.
Then you're gonna wanna take it slow, because there's this dirt road.
It's right before the white sign with a 3 on it, okay?
Now you're gonna be way, way out in the boonies, okay?
Like crazy far, so just keep heading down that dirt road for like what?
About another 15 miles.
Really? That far?
Yeah. Hurry up. The battery.
All right, just go down that road for like 15 more miles, all right?
I mean, we're way the hell out here. All right?
Oh, and, yo, hey, listen. Bring water.
Leave now.
Here.
He's coming.
There was this guy on the Discovery Channel...
...who broke his leg mountain biking...
...and he had to drink urine for...
You know, just until the forest ranger found him.
He said it tasted like really hot, really old soda.
Look, we should just call, you know?
I'll be quick, just be like, "Yo, where are you?"
All right.
Come on.
Yo. Yo, where are you?
Oh, so you saw the white sign?
Yes, he's almost here.
Oh, man. We're getting really freaked out.
All right, so you're on the dirt road?
He's on the dirt road. Good. Good.
You just crossed the river? Yeah. Have you seen anything?
Wait, wait. What river?
Yeah, hey, yo, what river?
What the hell river you talking about? There's no river.
Hey, yo, Pete. Yo, Pete, can you--?
Phone's dead.
Now what?
Mr. White, what now?
Oh, come on. Seriously?
What's this?
I'm trying to...
...trickle-charge the battery.
Seriously?
Just by turning that thing?
The commutator.
It's the part which generates the electricity.
Usually this little piston engine turns it...
...but considering that it's lying here completely totalled...
Anyway.
Apply a little elbow grease.
It'll take longer, a lot longer...
...but theoretically...
...it should work.
Theoretically.
It has to work.
You understand?
Can I try?
Yeah.
How much longer?
I don't know.
Now?
Hey.
Mr. White.
Hey.
Yeah?
Yo, man, you hanging in?
Yeah, I'm good.
It's gotta be ready by now, right?
No, give it a little longer...
...just to make sure we're--
Methylamine doesn't spoil...
...does it?
No. That's not why we're here.
Yo.
Lie much?
Here, push.
Okay, okay, okay.
Now.
Go on.
Please, please, please.
Yes. Yes.
Come on. Damn. No, please, God.
No. God.
Please. Please.
Why couldn't I have just gone to Santa Fe?
Why? Why?
Mr. White.
Mr. White!
What are you doing?
Mr. White?
Oh, God.
I have this coming.
What?
I have it coming.
I deserve this.
Hey, snap out of it.
All right, first off, everything you did, you did for your family.
Right?
All I ever managed to do...
...was worry and disappoint them...
...and lie.
Oh, God.
All the lies.
I can't even...
I can't even keep them straight in my head anymore.
You know what? Screw this.
I'm walking. You can come or not.
Where's my other shoe?
Jesse. Jesse.
Your body...
...is running dangerously low on electrolytes.
Sodium, potassium, calcium.
And when they're gone...
...your brain ceases to communicate with your muscles.
Your lungs stop breathing, your heart stops pumping.
You go marching out there...
...and within an hour, you will be dead.
Okay, you need to cut out all your loser crybaby crap right now...
...and think of something scientific.
Something-- Something scientific, right.
What? Come on, man. You're smart, all right?
You made poison out of beans, yo.
All right, look. We got--
We got an entire lab right here, all right?
How about you take some of these chemicals...
...and mix up some rocket fuel?
And we can just send up a signal flare.
Or you make some kind of robot to get us help...
...or a homing device...
...or build a new battery or...
Or wait, no.
What if we just take some stuff off of the RV...
...and build it into something completely different?
You know, like a... Like a dune buggy.
And that way, we can just dune-buggy or...
What? Hey. What is it?
What?
Do you have any money?
Change, I mean. Coins.
Yeah, I got a bunch from the--
Okay.
Yes.
Gather them.
And washers and nuts and bolts and screws...
...and whatever little pieces of metal we can think of that is galvanized.
It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.
Solid zinc, okay.
And-- And bring me--
Bring me brake pads.
The front wheels should have discs. Take them off and bring them to me.
Okay. Brake pads, okay.
Brake pads.
What are we building?
You said it yourself.
A robot?
A battery.
Yes.
Move!
This doesn't look like any battery I ever saw.
Well, trust me, it is a battery.
Or rather, one cell of a battery.
Here. Cut up the last two sponges.
Remember the electrolytes?
Well, think about it.
A battery is a galvanic cell.
It's no more than an anode and a cathode...
...separated by an electrolyte, right?
Right.
Yeah, well, anyway.
Here. On one side, you have mercuric oxide...
...and graphite from your brake pads.
This is the cathode. This is the positive terminal.
This is where the supply of current flows out from, you see?
Then... Here, I'll show you.
On the opposite side is our anode.
This.
It's zinc.
It's what we find in our coins and anything galvanized.
So the sponge is the electrolyte?
Yeah.
Well, no, the potassium hydroxide is the electrolyte.
But, yes, that's what I'm soaking the sponges in.
Good.
Good. And now, what shall we use...
...to conduct this beautiful current with?
What one particular element comes to mind?
Wire.
Copper.
Oh, I mean--
Copper.
Right.
The only question now is will this supply enough current?
And how many cells will we need?
We've only got material enough for six.
Okay.
Put the lid on. Wait. Positive.
All right.
Cathode.
Anode.
Damn. That is good.
That is very good. Okay. Here we go.
Come on.
<i>Attention, passengers.: Please maintain visual contact...</i>
<i>...with your personal belongings at all times.</i>
<i>Any bags left unattended will be confiscated by...</i>
How's the...?
It's fine.
I know I can trust you to...
Yeah.
Hey, whatever happens...
...your family will get your share.
Thank you.
So...
...I'll be hearing from you, yeah?
Yeah.
<i>How's everyone doing?</i>
Is that baby ever gonna come out, you think?
I know. I know, enough already. It's--
I'm teasing.
Everything in its time.
Walt, I have your scan results.
Yeah.
You're showing signs of remission.
Oh, my God.
I wanna clarify.
There are misconceptions about what remission signifies.
It does not mean that the patient is cured.
To classify someone as in remission...
...we only need to determine that the tumour hasn't grown.
That it hasn't grown? Jesus.
Technically speaking...
...a tumour can remain the exact same size it was before...
...and the patient could still be in remission.
Now, in Walt's case, with a stage lll adenocarcinoma...
...I'd like to see, I hope to see...
...at least a 25- to 35-percent reduction in tumour mass...
...something to tell me that the cancer has responded to the therapy.
Everybody still with me?
And how has my cancer responded?
Walt, your tumour has shrunk by 80 percent.
Oh, my God.
Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.
Wait, I'm really... I'm confused.
Is--? Isn't 80 percent a lot?
Mom, yeah.
Yes, 80 percent is a lot.
Okay, but, I'm-- Wait--
Sweetheart, you were right.
It's very good news.
It's very good news.
Oh, my God.
My God, are you kidding me?
Just when I try to get out, they pull me back in.
That's great.
Now, that cough is the other thing we need to discuss.
According to your scan, Walt, you have radiation pneumonitis.
It's okay. This is fairly common.
See that scary-looking thing there?
That's tissue inflammation. It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.
It's usually not serious, but it can produce a cough like that.
I'll prescribe some prednisone.
Tissue inflammation? I...
Are you sure about that? I mean, I--
Because the other day, I was coughing up some blood.
What?
You probably have a tear...
...in your oesophagus from coughing.
That can be serious. You could rupture and bleed to death.
This is something we're gonna have to deal with before you leave today.
Wait a minute. When did this happen? Why didn't you tell me?
I'm sorry, I just--
No more secrets, Walt.
With something like this, you have to call me immediately.
Now, with these results, we're not completely out of the woods.
But now at least we have some options...
...the most important of which is time.
We'll have more to discuss in the next few weeks.
But for now, I'd say that you folks have earned some celebrating.
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
ï»¿1
You're not thinking about going to work today, are you?
Thought I would. That inhaler really seems to be doing the trick.
What?
Just take the rest of the week.
Please. You've earned it.
Don't push it.
Besides, I want you well for the weekend.
Mom wants to party.
It's just a little get-together, that's all.
Sunday afternoon, maybe? Nothing too big.
Just family and a few friends.
We've got a lot to celebrate. Don't you think?
Sounds good.
Oh, thank you.
Now...
...what are you supposed to do today?
Nothing.
Excellent.
Brownie points for taking a nap.
Can you meet?
I thought maybe you might have, you know...
...kicked.
Signed-- Signed off.
I was even checking the obits.
No such luck.
So where does it stand?
Coughing up blood, giving speeches, you know, like:
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."
What's the upshot?
The upshot.
The upshot is that I have radiation pneumonitis.
Damn.
Actually, it's not as bad as it sounds.
It's a fairly common occurrence, easily treated.
In fact...
...the news is all good.
What do you mean, good?
You mean, like, "good" good?
What, you mean, like, remission good?
Remission. Not to imply I'm cured. I still have cancer.
But there's been a significant reduction in the tumours.
How significant?
Eighty percent.
Dude. No way.
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet, not by any stretch...
...but "options" is the word they keep bandying about.
That's awesome. Serious?
That's-- That's great, man.
I mean, my aunt, she never-- I mean, you know, at your stage...
...I didn't think that could happen.
Yeah.
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!
No. You must be so psyched.
Of course. I am.
Okay, now we...
I mean, what do we...?
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.
So how do you want to...
...you know, proceed...
...in light of this kick-ass news?
We'll take our time and stay cautious.
Sell off what we have.
And then...
Well, then I guess...
...I'm done.
Batter up.
Everyone?
Hey, you guys. I would like to make a toast...
...with my non-alcoholic beverage.
Somebody kill the music.
I know one party can't begin to repay...
...all your support and your many, many kindnesses.
But then again...
...Hank does make one mean margarita.
We really do want to thank you.
These last few months have been...
...wow, a challenging time, to put it mildly.
But I have to say Walt's come through it like a champ.
All right.
Honey, I'm so proud of you.
We all are.
Okay, I'm gonna stop with the sappy stuff. I am.
But it's true. It really is.
And for the first time in a long time...
...we are so excited about the future.
Okay, anyway...
...I want to also express my gratitude...
...to two very special people who couldn't be here today.
But they send their regrets and their warm wishes.
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz...
...for those of you who don't know them, are...
Well, they're heroes.
They are incredibly generous friends who made the amazing offer...
...to pay for Walt's treatment.
And they did.
So...
...to Gretchen and Elliott.
To Gretchen and Elliot.
Cheers.
Hey, how about the man of the hour? Come on.
Speech.
Yes.
Speech.
Yeah, Dad.
Come on, Walt. Speech.
Well, it's...
It's kind of funny.
When I got my diagnosis, cancer...
...I said to myself, you know:
"Why me?"
And then...
...the other day, when I got the good news...
...I said the same thing.
Anyway.
Thank you for coming.
And enjoy.
All right, cheers.
Yeah.
Cheers.
Inspirational.
Tell you what. I gotta give those bastards points for originality.
I'll tell you that much.
A little mercury switch, 9-volt battery...
...five or six ounces of C-4, that's how those cartel boys party.
Yeah, but why a turtle?
Oh, that's the best part. It was a...
It was a... What the hell's the word I'm looking for?
Not a metaphor, not an analogy, it's a...
Walt, what's the word I'm looking for?
Anyway...
...Tortuga. Okay? That was the name of our snitch.
Bean-speak for tortoise. Okay?
Tortoise, turtle, what have you. I never knew the difference myself.
Hey, top me off there, will you, buddy?
Anyway.
Poetic.
I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic. That's the word.
I guess that's the word.
Go ahead.
Better not let your mom see.
Oh, yeah, I think I see a hair. Maybe two.
There's no worm in this, right?
No, that would be mescal.
Talk about your hangovers, okay?
I was down in Glynco, Georgia. I was back east, doing some training.
Had this firearm instructor who was...
He was a good old boy, you know? Hey. There you go. Thanks.
I mean, this guy could put them away like he had two livers, okay?
Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish.
We were drinking mescal stupid.
But-- Hey, hey.
Walt, what you doing there?
What does it look like I'm doing?
The kid's 16.
What are you going for, Father of the Year?
What are you looking at him for?
We're celebrating. Come on.
That's all right.
No.
Jesus.
Listen, I'd take a pass on that one if I were you, okay?
Think we've been bogarting this puppy long enough.
Hey.
Bring the bottle back.
Sorry, buddy. No can do.
It's my son. My bottle. My house.
It's all right.
What are you waiting for?
Bring it back.
Why don't we just call it a day?
All right, pal?
We good?
The bottle.
Now.
What's going on?
Jesus.
Here, sweetie. Okay. Okay.
Oh, my God.
Okay. Okay.
There you go. Okay. That's it.
Just get it out. That's okay.
This is your brain.
This is your brain on drugs.
You weren't supposed to wake up.
Ever or...?
No, I was just thinking that I'd bring it, you know, in.
You want me to go back to bed?
No, I guess that'd be kind of--
No.
Need some help?
No, I got it.
Just have a seat.
Is there any coffee?
Yeah, shit. One second.
Well, at least let me do that.
No, I don't want you to have to do anything, you know?
All right. Here. You take the good one.
It's huevos rancheros.
I can tell.
Yeah?
Fork.
Oh, yeah.
There you go.
So, what are you up to today? Working?
Whatever that means.
No.
I'm all yours.
Really?
<i>Hey, this is Skyler. Please leave me a message. Thanks.</i>
Hi.
I just wanted to say that...
No.
We'll talk tonight...
...but I wanted to say that...
...I'm not exactly sure who that was yesterday...
...but it wasn't me.
And I'm sorry.
Love you.
Oh, boy.
<i>I just wanted to say that...</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>We'll talk tonight, but I wanted to say that...</i>
Hey there.
Wow, who brought the churros?
That would be me.
If I leave them at home, I'll just wind up eating them all myself, so...
They're actually-- They're leftovers. We had a little get-together for Walt.
It wasn't his birthday, was it?
Actually...
...Walt's got...
He's been battling cancer.
Skyler--
And last week we got good news.
I'm so sorry.
But we're really optimistic.
Great.
Great. Good news is great.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is. It really is.
Well...
...feel free to bring these any time.
Yeah.
Got some real beauts.
You cannot beat the thermal efficiency of the C3.
Yeah?
Then again, what about tankless?
Sure. We got them.
The good ones will really run up your price though.
Set you back about 1200.
It's not an issue.
You want installation, right?
No. I'm gonna do it myself.
That's what I like to hear.
And who's this? This guy can surf without a board?
That's Hover Man.
He can surf, skate, glide...
...whatever, because he's always got a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.
That's cool. Great lines.
And this guy? What's his superpower?
That's Kanga-man.
Kanga-man? Half-man, half-kangaroo?
And who's this in his pouch?
His sidekick, Joey.
He rides around in his pouch and, you know...
...fights crime.
So that makes Kanga-man a she.
You know that, right?
Only female kangaroos have pouches.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
But, you know, it's definitely a dude.
He's a product of experimentation.
He's kind of hot, I guess. Nice haunches.
And this is?
It's Backwardo.
Wait, no. I actually-- I changed it to Rewindo.
Anyways, he goes backwards.
He can make everything go in reverse.
Time and stuff? Like time travelling?
No, he just walks backwards.
He walks backwards?
Is that a superpower? What good is that?
No, I mean, he does it, like, really fast.
Okay, look, say someone's coming at him with a knife, right?
I mean, it's helpful. Then he can just zip backwards away from them.
Okay.
Yo, I was a kid...
...when I drew all these.
It was like four years ago.
They all look like you.
What?
It's you in all of these.
No.
I wonder what a shrink would say if he saw them.
Oh, shut up.
Like you never wanted a superpower.
Is that your door or mine?
I don't know.
It sounds like mine.
I gotta go.
Where?
Hey, where?
Hey, hold up. Where are you...?
Jane.
Jane.
Hey, Dad.
There you are.
Hi, honey.
I saw your car, so I was pretty sure you were home.
Yeah, sorry. I was working. I had my headphones on.
Finally realised that I wasn't the drum track?
Exactly.
Well, I was in the neighbourhood.
Was wondering if you wanted to grab some lunch.
Sure. Yeah.
Hey, this your dad?
Yes.
Hello.
Hi.
This is the new tenant.
Donald.
Jesse.
I'm sorry. Did you need something?
No.
Dad, why don't you come in?
It was nice seeing you.
It was nice to meet you.
You too.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, son. Are you home early?
No.
Oh, man.
It was a good day?
Now it is. Finally, hot water. No more toxic waste.
Yes. Yes, indeed.
Top of the line, on demand, unlimited supply.
Sweet.
Yeah.
Hey, want to take her for a spin?
Oh, yeah.
Listen, why don't you go to the kitchen sink?
Let me know when you're ready, and I'll give you a holler.
Okay.
Pilot in.
Ignition. Bingo.
Okay.
Ready.
All right. Let her rip.
Hundred and seventeen thousand BTUs.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.
Built-in corrosion-resistant draught reducer...
...safety thermocouple with the pilot burner.
Sounds really good, Dad.
And the energy savings. I mean...
Oh, careful, careful, careful.
There's probably some adjustments I need to make. You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Okay.
Son...
...about yesterday--
I'm sorry about the pool.
No, no, no, that was not your fault. Not at all.
See, your...
Your old man embarrassed himself...
...and I'm not very proud of my behaviour.
I have to say I feel very foolish.
You and Uncle Hank, you seemed pissed off.
No. No. We're fine. Everything's fine.
I called him this morning and made my apologies.
But, son, I owe you an apology most of all.
I should have used better judgment all around.
Having you drink in the first place, it was not right...
...and for that I'm very sorry.
But I kept up, right?
You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.
I have some tools to put away.
Hey.
Yo.
You want to catch a movie later?
Yo.
What?
What was that all about?
What?
Before. With your dad.
It wasn't about anything.
Oh, okay, so I totally just misread your total dis?
If anything, I was doing you a favour.
A favour?
Yeah, I told you. He's a hard-ass.
He seemed cool to me.
Yeah, well.
So, what's the deal?
There's no deal.
I was helping you out, okay? Protecting you.
How's that?
I mean...
...I'm letting you smoke in here and everything.
I bought a filter.
And I figured the less he knows, the better.
You acted like you didn't even know me.
So?
So?
You think I'm gonna be all like:
"Dad, meet the stoner guy who lives next door.
And by the way, I'm sleeping with him"?
That's all you think you're doing?
Why do you even care about my dad?
I don't.
Good. Then I don't know why we're talking about it.
Us. All right? I'm talking about us.
Us.
Yeah.
You and me.
Who's you and me?
I'm out of here.
Oh, boy.
Dad?
Dad? Hello?
What? Oh, hey.
What are you doing?
We've got rot.
Rot?
Yeah. Here.
I'll show you. Here.
Take a look at that.
See that? Yeah. Ever seen anything like it?
It's wood.
It's wood...
...that contains fruiting bodies.
Fruity what?
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.
I don't really see anything.
Yeah, well, it's there. You just have to know where to look. Here.
Then you cut it all out.
You just cut it out and start fresh.
Well, better get to it.
Is the whole house gonna collapse or something?
Not if I can help it.
Hey. You bucking for a promotion?
Go home already.
I will. I will.
Hey, can I just ask...
...the Keller account?
The Keller account?
It's listed as a current asset on this balance sheet...
...but the invoice was never presented to accounts receivable, so...
Oh, God.
One of these days I'm gonna just sort through all the Dad stuff.
He had so many "Don't worry about it, pay me Friday" relationships...
...with these little companies.
We'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not.
Right.
Seriously, you're not gonna make me lock you in, are you?
Sky?
Skyler?
Jesus.
No, I'm fine.
It's hormones. Honestly. It happens all the time.
I'll see you tomorrow.
What's wrong?
I guess it just...
...doesn't feel any different.
The good news?
I mean, nothing's really changed.
It's just postponed.
There was supposed to be a light at the end of the tunnel.
But lately, it just feels like...
More tunnel.
I'm sorry.
I just feel so damn ungrateful.
I don't know.
For me, it was the flu.
What?
My dad rallied at the end.
I mean, it wasn't the full-on good news Walt got...
...different circumstances, but we were happy...
...we were over the moon.
And right then, I got sick.
Flu. Knocked me on my ass for days.
Couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't move.
Great timing, huh?
Yeah.
And I wasn't even putting two and two together. I was just thinking:
"Why now?"
Being that rock.
You know...
...being that rock takes everything you got.
Yeah.

I'm going back.
All right. We'll take care of that tomorrow. Okay, good night.

Good night.

<i>We have everything you need to do the job right.</i>
Thanks.
Sure.
Next.
Hi. Here you go.
You didn't buy my stuff?
No, I didn't.
We don't have time for this.
Hey, there he is. That's the guy.
Stay out of my territory.
ï»¿1
What's up?
How's it going?
All right.
What you need?
You buying or you just stopping to envy?
Yeah. Punk bitches.

Bounce, little man.
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine, getting eyeballed hard.
I got a bad feeling, man. I need some backup.
Get your ass up here now.
What's that thing in your ear?
What did I say? Get out of here!
What are you waiting for? Go!
Well, Walt, we've made such headway with your treatments...
...that now it's time we talked about sealing the deal.
Absolutely.
As you know...
...my initial diagnosis was that your cancer was inoperable.
That may no longer be the case.
We think now that a lobectomy may be a viable option.
Maybe a pretty good option.
Dr. Bravenec is one of the few surgeons in the country...
...performing lobectomies after full-dosage radiation.
He's got a good track record.
Pretty good.
It sounds...
...aggressive.
Yes. Very much so.
Understand that if you don't have this surgery...
...you're just waiting for the cancer to spread.
And it will.
Through the treatment you've had, we've bought you some time.
Maybe a lot, probably a little...
...but that's all.
In my opinion...
...if you're willing to take some risk...
...then this offers the best chance.
How much would it cost? I mean, I'm not on your insurance.
I'd say between 170-...
...and 200,000, all in.
For my part, I'd be willing to write off what I can...
...but mine isn't even the biggest expense.
This is obviously a big decision...
...and you folks are gonna wanna take some time to discuss it.
No.
I'll do it.
Walt, don't you think we should at least talk this through first?
I just think it's the way to go.
I have to say, I think it's the right choice.
I recommend that we let the pneumonitis heal...
...for another couple of weeks...
...and then we'll have at it.
That's tricky.
When's the due date?
It's the 21 st.
So two weeks and change?
I'll book the surgery for four weeks from now.
That way Walter can be on his feet for the birth of your daughter.
But I wouldn't wait any longer.
Yeah.
Fourteen messages...
God.
<i>- Yeah.
It's me.</i>
<i>Where the hell were you? I called, like, 20 times.</i>
Working.
What is it?
Combo's dead.
<i>Shot.</i>
Which one is he?
You did not just say that to me.
<i>- Jesse, listen--
That figures.</i>
What's the word on the street?
No one's dropping no names.
Combo rang me before it went down, said dudes were mad-dogging him...
...trying to run him up off the corner. That's all I know.
Why'd we have to go pushing into new turf, yo? I mean...
...what'd you expect?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Is that all you got?
I'll do right by Combo's people.
But make sure you bust up your cell and toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.
I appreciate what you're saying and all...
...but with Combo gone and Badger laying low out in Cali...
I'm on probation, man.
Fast track to Los Lunas.
We're on the verge...
...of making some serious coin, Skinny.
What, you're gonna jump ship now?
This game we playing? We don't got the street cred to survive it.
Back when everyone thought you killed Spooge...
...maybe we were doing okay, but that whole...
...thing to the head thing, the ATM?
Yeah?
His junkie bitch copped to it.
Whole town knows it wasn't you.
Everyone knows?
Why didn't you say something?
I don't know, man.
Because we like you and all.
I'm telling you, just sit tight.
We'll get by.
All right? We'll make it.
Sorry, Jesse.
I'm out.
We have had a bit of a setback.
That's an accurate description. What else do you want me to call it?
How about "your fault"?
No, no, don't lay that on me.
You are in charge of distribution.
You said expand the territory.
Doesn't mean you become careless.
Guys, guys! Hey!
Do I look like Maury Povich? I'm not your marriage counsellor.
Now, you're professionals. Act like it.
Now, setback. Go.
One of our dealers was murdered.
It was some kind of turf dispute...
...and apparently we lost.
And then everyone quit on us.
I mean, we have absolutely no distribution.
Is there any way any of this can be traced back to you?
Now, the police, I'm talking about.
Well, there's your silver lining.
How about you? How's the health situation?
It's better. Do you mind?
Better?
Yeah, it's...
...looking a little more positive.
I may have more time than I thought.
Outstanding.
Now, as to your dead guy:
occupational hazard.
Drug dealer getting shot?
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it's been known to happen.
Now, what about product on hand? How's your inventory?
Thirty-eight and change.
Thirty-eight ounces? Grams?
Pounds.
You did say make hay while the sun is shining.
Guys!
Why the long faces here?
You're sitting on a gold mine.
A gold mine we can't sell.
We need a proper infrastructure.
We need foot soldiers and we need dealers...
...on a street level that are rock solid.
We need muscle and we need enforcers.
Payback. That's what we need.
God.
I mean, this entire process has just been so...
It's always been one step forward and two steps back.
We need your help.
Look, let's start with some tough love, all right?
Ready for this? Here goes.
You two suck at peddling meth. Period.
So give up on trying to do it all yourselves.
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.
Look, we are not going to deal with another high-level distributor.
No, thank you. We have been down that road.
What, some tattooed speed freak?
No. What you two need is an honest-to-God businessman.
Somebody who treats your product...
...like the simple high-margin commodity that it is.
Somebody who ships out of town, deals only in bulk.
Someone who's been doing this for 20 years and never been caught.
You know someone like that?
Let's just say I know a guy who knows a guy.
Who knows another guy.
Let me make some calls, see if I can get you a meeting.
Well, what's his name?
I have no idea.
He's very low profile. He's careful like that.
You know, from what I do hear about him...
...he sounds a little like you.
<i>And McDonald tabletops it, lands it.</i>
<i>He's coming to the end and he's got the big fist pump.</i>
<i>Now Mueller's coming. Oh, a double! Here he comes.</i>
<i>And he's coming to the end and he takes second.</i>
I need you to leave.
Look, there's...
...some stuff about me you don't know and...
Like you're a drug dealer?
I kind of got that.
You pay in cash and you use an alias, so...
One of my guys...
...a friend who worked for me...
...got murdered.
It was my fault. I put him on that corner.
I'm gonna smoke some crystal and I just think you should go...
...being that you're in a programme and all and...
You could come with me to a meeting.
No.
No meetings.
We could just get out of here.
It won't help.
Yeah, it will.
And I don't need you telling me that it won't.
I just...
All right, I really just need you to go.
Sir? Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.
You're late.
Yeah.
We're in the big time now.
So where's the kingpin?
Your guess is as good as mine.
So you get the dude's name?
Nope.
So let me get this straight. He's allowed to know all our names...
...what we look like, but not the other way around?
Why don't you get yourself some food?
So we won't both sit here with our Happy Meals...
...looking like a couple chumps?
Gentlemen, is everything to your satisfaction?
Fine, thanks.
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.
I don't get you, man.
A week ago you talked like you were all ready to hang it up.
We've nearly got 40 pounds we still need to sell.
Yeah, what about after?
After you gonna make up some new magic number?
Like, "I got bills. I got bills. I gotta make more."
What do you want me to say, Jesse?
Things have changed.
Oh, I know.
We got a guy killed.
You know what?
This is bullshit.
I'm out of here.
Hey.
I think she's waking up from a nap.
She is certainly gonna wanna get out and stretch those legs soon.
We have to keep an eye on your fluids.
You're on the low side of normal.
What? How low?
It's not a problem unless we see a growth drop-off, so we're good.
We'll have you in for an ultrasound next week and keep an eye on things.
Hey.
Oh, man, you would not believe the traffic.
That's why I left 40 minutes early.
Sorry. Hi.
Hi.
What did I miss?
For your refrigerator.
Oh, my God.
Look at her.
Look.
Yeah.
God. It's like she's here already.
I was just telling Skyler everything looks great.
Okay, we've been talking about it for months now.
It's time to make a decision.
You know what I'm gonna say.
The C-section?
And if it's a yes, we need to schedule it.
Well, my last labour was pretty tough, so...
For the baby, I say yes.
I agree, considering that your fluids are on the low side.
It's best we take her a little early. So why don't we schedule it for...
...a week from Friday?
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?
We have a birthday.
The 16th.
I like it.
Yeah.
You know, speaking of birthdays...
...I've got to run back to the office, so I will see you later?
It's an hour before closing.
You're supposed to be taking it easy.
We're having a get-together for Ted's birthday...
...and I've gotta pick up the cake.
Why you?
Because I said I would...?
It is the least I can do.
Okay?
Yeah, okay. Yeah.
Bye.
Bye.
Let's get out of here.
You know, go do something.
Seriously.
You know that museum in Santa Fe you talked about?
Let's take a drive.
Sure.
No, I cannot return that stock. It's been drilled, it's been cut.
We're halfway through the job.
<i>Mr. Beneke to the shop, please. Mr. Beneke to the shop.</i>
All right. Just let me think about it, okay?
I gotta go.
Dean, I gotta go.
Okay, all right.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Oh, my God. This is beautiful, guys. Thank you very much.
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna hold out much longer.
Wait a minute. You making a wish? You gotta make a wish.
Okay. Well, let's see. The economy's in the toilet.
China's undercutting us at every turn. I'm at a loss.
Wait. Skyler?
Yes?
I wanna hear it first.
Absolutely not. No way.
You cannot deny your employer his birthday wish.
Yes, I can. Watch me.
Please!
If this is your birthday wish, I feel very, very sorry for you.
Come on. It was so good last time.
It was ages ago.
And I'm enormous now.
And I don't look anything like her anymore.
Not that I ever did. I mean, come on.
These candles are getting wax all over the place.
Seriously.
Yes, come on, Skyler.
<i>- Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...
It's obscene.</i>
<i>Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy birthday, Mr. President</i>
<i>Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated</i>
<i>Happy birthday</i>
<i>To you</i>
That was fantastic.
Isn't she great, huh?
Okay, here we go.
<i>- He wasn't there.
Oh, he was there, all right.</i>
What are you talking about? I sat there for two hours.
Nobody came.
<i>All I know is my contact said he was there.</i>
Are you sure you were at the right restaurant?
<i>Yes, I'm positive.</i>
<i>- Where was he?
Who knows?</i>
Maybe he checked you out with a telephoto lens...
...didn't like the cut of your jib.
Anyway, it doesn't matter now because my contact says it's a no-go.
What? What do you mean?
No deal. No dice.
Shot at and missed. Shit on and hit.
Wait a minute.
How can he make that decision without even meeting me?
<i>I told you, he's very cautious who he does business with, all right?</i>
He's skittish, like a deer.
Call him back.
<i>I'm sorry. I can't do that.</i>
Yes, you can. Call him, Saul.
First of all, I never called him, all right?
I called a guy who called a guy who called a guy.
Second of all, it's over.
<i>Understand? With this particular individual...</i>
<i>...all you get is the one shot.</i>
Look...
...I'll see if I can scrape something else together...
...but don't get your hopes up.
<i>No one else handles that kind of bulk.</i>
Damn it.
Lucy, you must remember to have the salt and pepper shakers wiped.
Can I help you, sir?
Diet Coke, please.
And five minutes of your time.
What can I do for you?
Have a seat.
Please.
I would like to know why you wouldn't meet with me yesterday.
I'm sorry. I'm not following.
I sat here yesterday, waiting to meet with someone.
I believe that person was you.
I think that you're confusing me for someone else.
I don't think I am.
Sir, if you have a complaint...
...I suggest you submit it through our e-mail system.
I would be happy to refer you to our website.
I was told that the man I would be meeting with...
...is very careful.
A cautious man.
I believe we're alike in that way.
If you are who I think you are...
...you should give me another chance.
I don't think we're alike at all, Mr. White.
You are not a cautious man at all.
Your partner was late and he was high.
Yes. Yes, he was.
He's high often, isn't he?
You have poor judgment.
I can't work with someone with poor judgment.
Are you familiar with my product?
I've been told it's excellent.
It is impeccable.
It is the purest...
...most chemically sound product on the market anywhere.
That is not the only factor.
You could charge twice the current rate for what I provide...
...and your customers would pay it.
Hands down.
Now, who I choose to do business with on my end is not your problem.
You won't see him.
You won't interact with him.
Forget he exists.
I have to ask.
Why?
Why him?
Because he does what I say.
Because I can trust him.
How much product do you have on hand?
Thirty-eight pounds.
Ready to go at a moment's notice.
Will I hear from you?
I have your numbers.
You can never trust a drug addict.
Look, I mean, it's all kind of little dribs and drabs...
...but right here, take Keller, for instance.
A couple hundred dollars here, a few thousand there.
Dribs and drabs.
Once you add it all up, though, with Keller...
...the revenues are almost 10 percent less than was actually received.
And this is every quarter for the last two years.
When I saw that, I got worried so I checked Accounts Receivable.
I found six other instances...
...of revenues being under-reported.
And I've only just started to look into it.
We have requirement contracts with a lot of these companies.
They anticipate their needs for the next quarter.
Most of the time, they overestimate.
I let them roll their overages into the next order...
...and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.
Obviously, we forgot...
...or didn't go back and adjust the revenue entries.
I know it's wrong from an accounting standpoint, but as you can see...
...the money's coming in eventually, as you can see.
Right.
Right...
...but I got the old bills of sale and order forms out of storage...
...to try and sort this out.
Most of the time, there's no backup for the reported revenues at all.
In a few cases...
...I found xeroxed copies with the dates changed.
Ted.
All right.
You got me.
We're talking nearly a million dollars of undocumented revenue.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking...
...about saving a company.
I'm thinking about people's jobs...
...about their mortgages and pensions...
...and their college funds for their kids.
Not to mention my own.
It doesn't mean that you have to break the law.
Yes, it does, Skyler.
It's in the books. Business is terrible.
The bank is on my back, the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.
If I don't keep up--
Ted.
People go to prison for this.
My dad built this company from nothing.
We make things here.
The people who work here are like family.
I can't let that all fall apart because of a couple of bad years.
Sky...
...don't report this.
Please.
I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.
But I can't be a part of it.
I know.
I know. I just wish...
I'm sorry.
I don't want you to go.
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>
<i>Yo, it's Skinny Pete. Just checking in with you, man.</i>
<i>We missed you at the funeral today.</i>
<i>The whole crew was representing.</i>
<i>Even Badger came all the way from Fresno.</i>
<i>Combo's people, his ma, grandma, cousins...</i>
<i>...everyone was all choked up and shit.</i>
<i>Man, it was, like, emotional.</i>
<i>And you should have seen the coffin.</i>
<i>It was this shiny white pearlescent.</i>
<i>I'm sure I've seen the exact same paint job on a Lexus.</i>
<i>So we're definitely talking high-end.</i>
<i>Anyway, guess you had something bigger going down.</i>
<i>Watch your back out there, bro. Peace.</i>
I like to mix some ice with it.
Hold that.
What's it feel like?
There's a chill.
Don't freak out. It passes.
And then...
You'll see.
I'll meet you there.
Take that off.
Phones off, please.
Pipes, I guess.
All right, everyone. Eyes on your paper.
Eyes on your paper.
Yes.
Excuse me, where's the manager?
I'm the manager. Can I help you?
No, no, no. I met a man here last week.
He's a black gentleman. He's thin. Glasses.
Yes, sir. That's the owner.
Oh, owner. Okay.
He owns 14 Los Polios restaurants in between here and Nevada.
He could be at any one of them.
Is there a phone number that I can get to...?
I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out.
Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy to refer you to our website.
No, no.
What's his name?
Gustavo.
Gus.
Thank you.
Thirty-eight pounds, $1.2 million.
Truck stop, two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.
One hour.
What?
One hour. You in or out?
In. In. Absolutely. But I just need a little more time.
One hour. If you miss it...
...don't ever show your face in here again.
Exit 13 off the 25 South, to a truck...
<i>- Come on! Come on!
Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>
Jesse. Jesse, pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.
I'm coming by. I need the product.
I need the product now.
Oh, God.
Jesse.
Jesse!
Jesse.
Jesse.
Jesse. Jesse.
Jesse.
Jesse.
Jesse. Jesse, wake up.
Jesse.
Jesse. Jesse, wake up. Wake up.
Wake up!
Come on, damn it.
Wake up.
Where'd you put it?
Where's the product?
Get off of me.
Where is it? Where'd you hide the meth?
In the kitchen.
Where?
Under the sink.
No. No, no, no. Not now, not now. Not now!
ï»¿1
Skyler, I'm so...
Marie. Oh, Christ, Marie. How...?
Oh, God. Oh, thank God.
Is she beautiful?
Yeah, I'm staring at brake lights on the 40.
Some accident up ahead.
Christ! Today of all days, huh?
No, no, no. Let her rest. I'll be there as soon as I can.
Thank you.
Excuse me. Skyler White?
307.
Thank you.
Skyler, I'm so sorry. I'm just...
Are you okay?
Meet your daughter.
Hi there, girl. Hi there, Holly.
Congratulations, Walt.
Oh, Ted, I'm sorry, I didn't see you here.
Oh, Ted drove me here. Thank God.
I mean, this little bundle of joy of ours was practically on rails.
Halfway here I thought he was gonna have to pull over...
...and deliver her himself.
Well, that-- I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Yeah. Thanks, Ted.
No problem at all.
Well, let me get out of your way here so you two can--
You three can be alone, okay?
Listen, take it easy, Sky.
I really can't begin to thank you.
Don't think anything of it.
It's my pleasure. Congratulations again.
Thank you.
She's beautiful.
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.
Okay. Take care.
Bye.
Are you okay?
Is everything okay?
Everything is okay.
I just wish you'd been here.
Where's everyone else?
Downstairs.
Hank and Marie took Junior for dinner.
He has been such a trouper. He even changed his first diaper.
No.
Yeah.
Did he?
Honey, is there anything that I can do for you?
Anything at all?
Actually, yes.
I left my overnight bag at home this morning.
I just think you get it in your head, C-section. You know?
But I'm just so glad, the way it all worked out.
Doing it natural instead.
It just couldn't have gone any better.
Good.
Let me go get your things.
And I'll get my stuff too, okay?
I'll spend the night.
Okay.
Dad.
I was in the shower, hey.
I overslept.
I'm running late, but I'll be there.
Yeah.
Baby, I gotta go.
Okay.
Somebody broke in.
Okay.
Oh, no. No, no, no!
Come on.
Damn.
Oh, God.
Oh, Christ.
This week was tough.
Toughest yet.
You know why? I knew this day was coming.
My birthday.
Your re-birthday?
Yeah. As it got closer, it got worse.
I was scared shitless I wouldn't make it.
I really didn't think I would.
Called in sick three days in a row.
I know my boss was pissed.
I guess I don't really care. I just didn't wanna see anybody.
You guys know how that is.
All it would take is one friend...
...and I'd be out ripping and running again.
But I made it. I really made it.
I got one year clean to the day.
You look tired. Your eyes are kind of red.
You getting enough sleep?
Actually, no.
I'm working on this really complex new tat.
Yeah?
A guy wants his whole back done up.
Him on his chopper with, like, flames all around.
I keep showing him the design, he keeps asking for changes, like:
"Give me more muscles. Give me more flames."
And I'm like, "A: This ain't the Sistine Chapel.
And B: I have enough trouble working around your zits."
I really wish you wouldn't work at that place.
You need to avoid those type of people.
I know and I do.
It's mostly college kids and airmen from Kirtland.
It's actually really corporate.
Thank you.
So how's your job?
Oh, you know. Same old, same old.
Doing backup training on my days off.
God, they're hiring anybody now. I mean, no experience at all. It's scary.
You seeing anyone?
No.
You?
What about that guy next door?
What do you mean?
Well, he seemed to have some expectation...
...of you introducing me to him.
He knows you own the place.
Yeah.
Dad, he's our tenant.
End of story.
Why would I get involved with a tenant?
Okay.
There you go.
Oh, yes.
Oh, isn't she beautiful?
I just think she's the most beautiful baby ever.
Yeah. And why not?
Good stock.
I'll get it.
Yeah. Yeah.
Hello. Hello?
Nobody's there.
Oh, well.
Beat you.
Hello.
Hey, man.
<i>Oh, hi, Carmen.</i>
Just Carmen.
Come on. Hurry up.
So you heard, huh? Yes, yes.
<i>Good news. Oh, she's just so beautiful.</i>
Well, Holly.
<i>Seven pounds, 3 ounces.</i>
Everybody is doing just fine.
You junkie imbecile. What are you calling this number for?
I am trying to tell you, man.
Last night, somebody broke in my place, yo.
<i>- I got robbed.
What?</i>
Yeah. Somebody, they got all of our stuff. Okay?
All of it.
You get me, Mr. White?
<i>The blue stuff. It's, like, uncanny.</i>
They knew exactly where to look.
I mean, say something, man, all right? Yell at me or something! Come on!
<i>Mr. White.</i>
God!
Oh, no.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Hank, come on. People are starving to death out here.
All right. I just had to get a beer.
Finally.
All right, guys. Here we go.
<i>We got mild, medium and muy caliente.</i>
I got dibs on the breast.
Los Polios Hermanos?
Oh, yeah, seriously. You gotta try it.
I think this joint gives KFC a run for their money.
That baby is hungry.
Give me that baby.
Oh, sweetie, yes.
Do you have any coleslaw in there?
Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Jeez, Sky.
Not at the table. We're eating.
Hank, it's only a breast.
It's my sister-in-law's breast.
Oh, you are so provincial.
Hank, remember the day...
...when you were talking to me about childproofing?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. What are you thinking? A fence or a cover?
Yeah. No, well, actually, I was thinking more of an alarm system.
They've got these new systems that are now sonar systems that would--
Anything falls into it, it sets the alarm off.
Oh, nice.
Wow, that sounds expensive.
Well, yeah.
But for the baby, I mean...
Well, why don't...
Why don't you let Marie and I get that for you?
Absolutely.
No, no. Thank you.
No, no, please. I'll be back at work soon.
We'll take care of it.
Back at work soon?
Since you're scheduled for surgery...
...I just thought it might be a good idea to have some money coming in.
Well, Skyler, we need to think about what's best for the baby.
And I think having her mother around for at least the first few years...
Money-wise, we'll manage. I promise you that.
What? You guys got, like, a printing press in the garage churning out 50s?
I wish.
Mom's even talking about me getting a job.
That's right. Everybody pitches in.
Why don't we ever get Chinese?
I'll get her.
I'll get her.
Yes. Good girl.
That's a good girl.
My little girl, huh?
Hey, do you wanna see something?
Come here.
Oh, I know, I know.
Yeah.
Hey.
You wanna see what your daddy did for you?
Let me show you.
Here. Come here.
Wanna see?
That's right. Daddy did that.
Daddy did that for you.
This place looks exactly the same.
Why don't you have computers and shit? It's the 20th century.
What the hell are you doing here?
Get out.
No. You took the stash.
I heard all those messages, figured it out.
You figured it out, huh? Well, congratulations, Einstein.
You left me to freak out all day long like I dropped the ball or something...
...and you were the one who took it!
Shut up.
You lower your voice.
"Like you dropped the ball"?
When have you ever not dropped the ball, Jesse?
Blasted out of your mind on whatever the hell that was.
What was that, heroin?
Jesus.
I was on my day off, man. What I do on my day off--
"Day off"? We were on call, you junkie.
On call for the biggest deal of our lives.
I just managed to pull it off by the skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.
And you made me miss the birth of my daughter.
Son of a bitch.
How much?
How much what?
How much did you get for the deal?
One-point-two million.
Six hundred thousand each.
Four hundred and eighty thousand.
Saul's cut is 20 percent.
All right. So where's my money?
What?
You are joking, right?
If I gave you that money...
...you would be dead inside of a week.
Man, look, I'm off the heroin.
I didn't even like it anyway. It made me sick.
And the... And the meth.
You know, I could take it or leave it.
I'm clean, Mr. White.
For real.
Prove it. Pee in that.
How gay are you, seriously?
Pee in it.
They're selling testing kits at the drugstores.
If you are clean, I will give you every last dime.
No, huh?
Well, I guess, until then you'll just have to depend...
...on the kindness of strangers to get high.
That and your little junkie girlfriend.
Not on her tummy, Walt.
I'm not putting her on her tummy.
I'll put her on her side. Do you wanna hold her back?
Yeah.
Right there.
Just in case she decides to do a little spit-up...
...I'm gonna roll up a nice clean towel like this and put it under.
Hammacher Schlemmer makes a proper one of those.
It's hypoallergenic.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I think a towel will do.
Skyler, what is it?
Your son. He is just unbelievable. Come see what he did.
I told you it's not ready yet.
Honey, just show it to them.
My God, son. That's wonderful.
Flynn.
This is beautiful.
SaveWalterWhite.com.
Well, I, for one, am telling everybody.
Wait a minute. You're not asking for money, are you, son?
Yeah. That's the whole idea.
Louis helped me set up a PayPal account and everything.
See?
But we can't ask for money.
Walt.
Okay.
I appreciate it. I really do.
Show me what else you put on.
This was all his idea. He worked so hard on it.
Just let him help.
Skyler.
It's-- You can't ask him to take it down.
It'll crush him.
Skyler, it's charity.
Why do you say that like it's some sort of dirty word?
This is insane.
I have so much cash on hand...
...that I actually count it by weighing it on my bathroom scale.
And yet, I can't spend it. I can't tell my family about it.
All of whom think that I am right on the edge of bankruptcy.
I mean, it's--
It's insane.
Well, I guess that's why gangsters had molls.
What?
Gun molls.
<i>Haven't you ever seen White Heat?</i>
<i>Yeah, I've seen White Heat...</i>
...but I don't see how that pertains.
Maybe you need a moll...
...more than a wife who you can't trust with your secrets.
Just--
What good is money...
...that doesn't spend? The tree falls in the forest...
You know, you get the point. So communicating is out?
Out.
Let's see. What else is there?
There's always, "Hey, I found a big bag of money...
...down by the rail road tracks."
No? No? Works for me.
Uncle Murray.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, "Oh, many is the happy memory...
...of Uncle Murray bouncing me on his knee.
We lost track of the old pervert years ago...
...but he kicked it, left me millions."
No, no.
It cannot be blind luck or some imaginary relative who saves us.
No, I earned that money, me.
And now my son created his own website...
...SaveWalterWhite.com, soliciting anonymous donations.
Do you have any idea how that makes me feel?
Yeah, look at that. It's got PayPal and everything.
Cyber-begging. That's all that is.
Just rattling a little tin cup to the entire world.
Yeah, there's no deep-seated issues there.
Walter, I'm looking at the answer here. It's staring me in the face.
Do I have to spell it out for you?
I know. I know.
You're thinking that I should be funnelling money...
...into my son's website, but absolutely not.
I am not going to have my family think that some...
...mystery benefactor saved us.
Not some mystery benefactor, singular.
That would raise too many questions. However--
Stay with me here.
-zombies.
<i>I got a guy, who knows this guy, who knows this Rain Man-type.</i>
He lives with his mother in her basement in Belarus, all right?
So good luck extraditing his fat Russian ass.
Wait. He's a hacker-cracker extraordinaire.
This guy can hijack random desktops...
...all around the world, turn them into zombies that do his bidding.
For instance, he can make it so 20- or 30,000...
...little donations come in from all over the U.S. and Canada.
Ten, 20, 50 bucks a pop...
...all paid in full, nice and neat, untraceable...
...from the good-hearted people of the world to Mr. Walter H. White...
...cancer saint.
I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling just thinking about it.
He's an asshole, that's what. Always judging me.
Not too much.
I mean, like, who is he, right?
I mean, first off, I taught him.
Always acting like I'm his indentured servant.
Now the cotton.
Needle?
I don't understand why you need him.
Exactly.
My point exactly.
Flat against your skin so it doesn't wiggle around too much.
How much does he owe you, anyway?
Four hundred and eighty.
Oh, hell, I'd be mad too if somebody owed me 500 bucks.
No, no.
Four hundred and eighty thousand.
What?
What?
Thousand.
Not on your back, in case you throw up.
On your side. Sleep on your side.
And she's all like:
"Don't preach to me." And I'm like, "Baby, I'm not preaching to you.
I'm talking about basic survival, you know?
I'm conversing about life and death."
I mean, this here, what we've been doing...
...hell, Becky knows.
Dad?
I overslept. I'm on my way.
Dad?
Dad, wait.
Dad, it's not what it looks like.
Dad.
Dad, will just wait? Let me-- Just talk to you for one second.
No, Dad.
Dad, come on.
Dad?
Dad, no. No, stop it! Don't touch him, Dad!
Dad, stop. Dad, let him go!
Son of a bitch.
Dad, no. Stop it! Stop it, Dad! Stop it!
Get away from me, man. Back off.
Jesse.
Jesse, no!
Back off!
Okay, everybody just calm down!
What's with you, yo?
Because I'll seriously bust you up.
You miserable little smackhead.
Get the hell out!
Hey, I pay my rent, bitch!
All right? I got civil rights.
Dad, no! Okay!
Jesse, come on. Please, no. Come on.
I pay my rent.
You're going back to rehab. Today. Now.
Look, as it so happens, we were just...
We were just talking about that now.
Yeah?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you, okay?
If you would just let me.
Eighteen months.
You have been clean for 18 months, Jane. Why? Why do you do it?
I backslid, okay?
Like, what?
What, you think I'm proud of this?
Like I do it on purpose?
Lying to me...
...shacking up and using with this scumbag, this loser.
It takes one to know one.
His name is Jesse. You don't know the first thing about him.
We talk about rehab every night. It's his idea.
You talk about rehab? Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?
Thank you for not being judgemental 24 hours a day.
Because that's exactly what I need, to be judged all the time!
Okay.
You know what you need? I'll tell you what you need.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I am calling the police.
Dad. Dad, no, don't.
Come on. Come on!
Dad, no. Don't.
I have tried 10 years...
...of love and understanding.
Maybe what it takes is you drying out in a jail cell.
Dad, no.
Yes, I would like to report drug use in a building that I own.
Dad. Daddy, no.
No. It's ongoing. It's illegal activity.
I'd like to talk to somebody.
Daddy.
Would you connect me, please?
Fine, we'll go to rehab.
I could care less about him going to rehab.
I want you in rehab.
I'll go first thing tomorrow.
Not tomorrow. Today.
I have to call into work. I have to stop the newspaper.
The last time I went, my houseplants died because you didn't water them.
Daddy, please?
I'll go.
<i>Albuquerque Police. How may I direct your call?</i>
Tomorrow.
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
Tomorrow.
You meant all that?
I don't know.
I just think if we had enough money...
...nobody could make us do anything.
Oh, just let it ring.
No, I'm gonna go see who it is.
It's okay, Holly.
It's okay, sweetie.
Good luck with that.
But I'm sure he'd be glad to, you know, write some--
You know, actually, here he is right now. So hold on a second.
What?
It's one of your...
One of your old students wants a letter of recommendation.
Oh, okay. Thanks.
Oh, honey, I think the baby is getting hungry.
<i>- This is Walter White.
Hello, Walter White.</i>
I'm sorry. I'm having a little trouble recalling--
It's Jane.
You know, of Jesse and Jane.
<i>Jesse's "junkie girlfriend."</i>
Oh, yes, yes. Of course. It really has been a long time.
Get somewhere where you can talk.
Sure. Yes. I am looking into that as we speak.
How the hell did you get this number? Did Jesse give it to you?
All Jesse wants is what's coming to him.
No more, no less.
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
Four hundred and eighty thousand.
<i>- He told you about the money.
He told me everything.</i>
So, what is this?
What, some kind of blackmail or something?
This is me telling you to do right by Jesse.
Bring him what you owe him.
<i>I don't call that blackmail.</i>
<i>I call that you getting off your ass, and being a decent human being.</i>
Well, I call it blackmail.
Dialling my number. Talking to my wife.
And what's your end of this?
How much heroin does a half a million dollars buy?
For your information, I am holding Jesse's money for him...
<i>...and he will receive every last dollar of it.</i>
He will, not you...
...at a time when I see fit.
But I will not contribute to his overdose.
<i>Now you tell him, if he gets clean--</i>
<i>- If you both get clean--
You know what?</i>
I take that back. This is blackmail.
Because what I know about you, high-school teacher...
<i>...turned drug dealer, with a brother-in-law in the DEA...</i>
<i>...that would make one hell of a story. National news, I'll bet.</i>
Do right by Jesse tonight or I will burn you to the ground.
Shit.
He's a high-school teacher. What's he gonna do, give you a B-minus?
Send you outside to clap the erasers?
You wouldn't really go to the cops, would you?
We won't have to. He'll pay.
And what if he doesn't?
Jesse, it's your money.
You're in the right here. He's in the wrong. He's not stupid. He'll pay.
What is it, really?
You don't want your half a million dollars?
You wanna renounce your earthly possessions and become a monk?
No, it's just, I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.
And by extension, you know, neither are you.
I mean, he's my partner.
I'm your partner.
<i>The largest land animal in all the planet...</i>
<i>...lives in a tightly knit matriarchal society...</i>
<i>...led by the eldest female in the herd.</i>
<i>Close your eyes and go to sleep.</i>
She is finally asleep.
What you doing, learning about elephants?
Oh, honey, we're out of diapers. Would you mind going out?
Jesse.
Not you.
Nice job wearing the pants.
How do I know she'll keep quiet?
I guess you don't.
You'll never hear from either of us again.
You're not seeing straight, Jesse.
You are making a mistake.
Do you know what this is?
It's a whole lot of cheddar.
This is freedom.
This is saying, "I can go anywhere I want.
I can be anybody."
Who do you wanna be?
Where do you wanna go? South America? Europe? Australia?
Is New Zealand part of Australia?
New Zealand is New Zealand.
Right on.
<i>New Zealand. That's where they made Lord of the Rings.</i>
I say we just move there, yo. I mean, you can do your art.
Right? Like, you can paint, like, the local castles and shit.
And I can be a bush pilot.
Yeah. New Zealand. I can get behind that.
But I guess I'm good anywhere as long as it's the two of us.
But first, we gotta get clean.
And not because anybody is telling us to.
We do this for us, right?
Yeah. Absolutely. For us.
All this here, we're not gonna just shoot this up our arms, Jesse.
We're not.
Hell, no. No, no, no. We're better than that.
We're way better than that. I say...
I say we flush what we've got left and we start tonight.
Yeah, we can do that.
Definitely.
Excuse me.
What can I get you?
Give me a Fat Tire draught, please.
Damn it.
Hey, honey.
No. I don't know what to tell you.
Three stores I've been to so far, and not one of them have it in stock.
Well, do they have to be diapers for newborns?
What if we went up a size and just kind of...
All right, all right. No, I understand.
All right. No, I'll just keep looking.
I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so...
Yeah. Okay. Love you.
Thank you.
God.
Well played.
They found water on Mars.
They have indeed.
Don't know what to do with that information...
...but, hey, God bless them, they found it.
Oh, well, actually...
...they theoretically can separate the hydrogen from the oxygen...
...and process that into providing fuel for manned space flights.
Ostensibly, turning Mars into a giant gas station.
So it's a...
Yeah. We live in an amazing time.
To water on Mars.
To water on Mars.
So, what did you have? Girl or boy?
Little girl.
That's nice.
Thanks.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I have a daughter.
Yeah?
How old?
Old enough to know better.
Twenty-seven next month.
You have other kids?
Just the one.
I've got a 16-year-old boy. Well, he's almost 16.
Jeez. Oh, there's a spread, huh?
But he helps out, though.
He's even changing some diapers now, so...
It's more than I managed to do when I was his age.
Kids today grow up faster, I think.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe so.
So, any advice?
Having a daughter. Any advice?
No, not really. Just love them.
Just-- Yeah.
I mean, they are who they are.
Yeah.
I've got this nephew.
This nephew who is-- I mean, he's an adult.
But you can't infantilize them, you can't live their life for them.
But still, I mean, there is that frustration.
You know, that...
God, that frustration that goes along with, you know:
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know what is best for you, so listen."
But of course, they don't.
I mean, what do you do with someone like that?
Family?
Yeah. Family.
You can't give up on them. Never.
I mean, what else is there?
Jesse, it's me.
Jesse, I just wanna talk.
Jesus.
Jesse.
Jesse.
Jesse, wake up.
Jesse, wake up.
No, no, no.
ï»¿1
Come on.
Come on.
Come...
Come on. Come on, baby.
Please, please. Come on, come on. Come on!
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
Yeah.
Slow down. Slow-- Slow down.
And just-- Just take a deep breath.
Do it.
All right.
Now, what happened?
All right. All right. Now...
...listen-- Listen to me. Are you listening?
Everything is gonna be okay. I promise.
No, no-- Listen. Calm down.
Just...
Sit tight. I know who to call.
Saul Goodman sent me.
Come on. Inside.
Watch the door.
Where is she?
Any other drugs in the house?
Think hard. Your freedom depends on it.
What about guns? You got any guns in the house?
Here's your story.
You woke up. You found her. That's all you know.
Say it.
Say it, please. "I woke up. I found her. That's all I know."
Say it. "I woke up. I found her. That's all I know."
I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.
Again.
I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.
Again. Again.
I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.
I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.
Once you call, the people who show up...
...will be with the Office of Medical Investigations.
That's primarily who you'll talk to.
Police officers may arrive, they may not.
Depends on how busy a morning they're having.
Typically, ODs are not a high-priority call.
There's nothing to incriminate you...
...so I'd be amazed if you got placed under arrest.
However, if you do, you say nothing.
You tell them you just want your lawyer.
Then you call Saul Goodman.
And do I need to state the obvious?
I was not here.
You put on a long-sleeved shirt...
...and cover those track marks on your arm.
Count down from 20, and then you dial.
Hang tough. You're in the home stretch.
Do you want 2-percent or skim?
Two.
Two. All right.
Thank you.
Junior.
Junior.
Flynn.
What?
Flynn.
Flynn.
I'll be there in a minute.
You all right?
Flynn, get your butt in here.
Oh, my God. Mom, Dad, come here. You gotta see this.
Seriously.
What?
Look right there. Look at that.
Are those donations?
Yes.
Actual donations for your dad?
Total strangers gave us $490.
Twenty-six people. Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.
Look at this one. Vancouver. All the way up in Canada.
And it's all real, actual money.
It's actually right there in the PayPal account.
And look what they're saying.
"Hang in there, Walt." "Good luck." "Hang in there."
Isn't this awesome?
That's-- Wow, that is something.
Walt, don't you think a little thank-you is in order?
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son.
Thank you. This is a big, big help.
Oh, look, 20 more bucks from Thunder Bay, Ontario.
Damn. Five hundred and ten dollars.
<i>If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you.:</i>
<i>"Do-not-call list."</i>
<i>However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep.</i>
How did I know you wouldn't be answering your phone?
I'm on my way. I'm gonna be there momentarily.
I expect you on the porch, bag packed, ready to go. No excuses.
Sir, you may not wanna be here for this.
I just woke up and I found her.
That's all I know.
What's her date of birth?
Sir, your daughter's date of birth?
April...
April 4th, 1982.
Okay.
And mother's maiden name and place of birth.
My mother?
Your daughter's mother.
Bishop.
And place of birth?
Phoenix.
Phoenix, Arizona?
This is our address.
Do you have someone who can drive you?
I can drive.
Well, then if you'd like to meet us there...
...we can complete the intake and take our samples...
...and then you can make your arrangements.
Okay?
Now, do you need a card? Will you both be coming?
I don't believe it. Walt, you have to see this.
Forty from Te--
Terre Haute.
Walt.
<i>It's me.</i>
<i>Are you there? Hello.</i>
I'm just checking in.
Our friend says he thinks everything went well.
That's-- That's good.
So listen. Just call me, all right?
Hey, Walt, you've gotta come in here. We just broke a thousand dollars.
All right. I'm coming.
Some of you already know my brother-in-law. He's a good man.
The doctors say this operation has a real chance of helping him.
They're also saying they wanna be paid in private islands, so dig deep.
Biggest donation...
...gets a six-pack of my very own Schraderbrau.
Home-brewed to silky perfection.
Smallest donation gets two six-packs.
All right. Other than Gomie here pees sitting down...
...here's what we know.
Christian Ortega, a.k.a. Combo.
Shot dead by an unknown assailant last month.
"Combo?" I hear you say.
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name. Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"
No. He was a dipshit wannabe banger.
Now, no arrests, save for stealing a baby Jesus...
...from a Knights of Columbus manger back when he was 17.
This dude was so low-rep, he never showed up on our radar.
So why am I talking about him?
Anyone? Anyone?
Bueller?
He was dealing Blue Sky.
That's right.
Now, how is it that the purest, most professional grade...
...of meth we've ever come across is being slung by the likes of that?
But wait. It gets better.
Since baby-Jesus thief there slowed a bullet with his neck...
...the blue stuff's vanished from town, okay?
Not a speck to be found in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?
Well, because maybe your Heisenberg's in prison.
So says A.P.D. They think they got their man.
I know you don't buy it, but maybe it's true.
James Edward Kilkelly, yeah. A.P.D. thinks this is our mastermind.
You believe that, I got a bridge to sell you.
He copped to it, didn't he?
For an extra pudding cup...
...every night at Los Lunas?
Maybe if you give him a pack of cigarettes...
...he'll tell you what he did with Jimmy Hoffa. No, no, no.
I've been thinking.
Top-shelf product like this? It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.
Raw talent's bound to pop up somewhere.
It's like Whack-A-Mole. So I've been making phone calls.
Local police departments, small-town sheriffs.
Haven't had much luck inside the Land of Enchantment.
But outside, I've got reports of the blue stuff...
...making a scene here in Texas, Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.
In fact, everywhere but here.
Almost as if somebody wised up, stopped shitting where they eat.
Now...
...I say Heisenberg's still out there.
I say he's gone regional.
Only he's still right here in town.
Come on, 2800.
Come on, big 28. You can do it.
Only 30 more dollars. Thirty more.
Fo-- Forty dollars! Twenty-eight ten.
Yes!
Yes!
Who's gonna be next?
Your guy found him?
Where is he?
Okay, listen.
No, no, I don't care.
You have your guy pick--
Saul. Just shut-- Saul.
Saul, shut up and give me the address.
I don't recommend it.
A.P.D.'s been known to sit on this place...
...keep an eye on the comings and goings.
Are they here now?
Well, I don't see any sign, but that's the point.
Police could be the least of it.
You could just get mugged or shot.
How about you go on home, Walter?
Let me handle this.
Yo.
Jesse.
Jesse. Jesse. Look at me, son.
Wake up. Wake up.
Hey.
I ain't got nothing for you, man. It's all gone.
Jesse, damn it, wake up. Just--
Jesse, Jesse. Jesse, it's me. Okay, it's me. It's Walt. It's Walt.
Jesse.
Yeah.
Come on, let's get out of here.
No, no, no.
I'm good.
Come on. Help me out now.
I'm good. I'm good. Right here, man. Right here.
Listen, Jesse, you are not good right here.
You are not good at all. You hear?
Now, you just put your arms around me. Come on.
You're gonna stand up...
...and we're gonna walk out of here, okay?
We're gonna take you someplace nice and safe.
That's it. Now, let's go. Come on. Here we go.
I killed her.
What?
I killed her. It was me.
I killed her, man. I killed her.
No.
Jesse, look at me. Look at me.
You didn't kill anybody.
I loved her.
I loved her more than anything.
No, no. No.
I haven't given much thought to the programs.
I guess they should be...
I don't know. Just use your best judgment.
There's no yellow dress here.
It's all-- It's all black and grey.
When's the last time you saw her ever wearing a yellow dress?
What about blue?
Blue's better than black, right?
No, no. Not dark blue. More like...
Not super-bright, either.
I mean, blue is blue.
No. No cleavage.
Long sleeves.
Yeah. It's nice.
It's nice.
Big yawn, Holly.
I know what you feel like. I'm tired too.
Okay, sweetie.
Yes.
Yes!
Here we go.
Here we go. Yes.
Would you mind turning that thing down or off?
Junior. Hey.
The dinging. Just turn down the volume.
Dad, it's money.
Just please do it.
Okay, the noise is disturbing the baby.
Marie, slow down. I can't--
Oh, my God. You are kidding me.
Sure. Of course. Any day after school.
Okay. Wait. I'm gonna-- Let me tell him, and I'll call you right back.
Okay.
Guess what.
What?
You are gonna be in the newspaper.
No way.
<i>One of Marie's patients works at the Journal.</i>
She told him about the website and the donations...
...and they're gonna do a story about you.
For real?
Yep.
They're coming to interview you with a photo and everything.
Awesome.
It'll mean more hits.
And more contributions.
East of Scottsdale?
Let me guess. Not talking.
Nope. Not a one.
Someone somewhere is running one tight ship.
All right, chief. Yeah. Thanks a lot.
Yeah. You too.
Agent Schrader, can you spare a moment?
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Gentlemen, this is Supervising Agent Hank Schrader.
Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Paul Canterna of Canterna Real Estate.
Hey, it's a pleasure.
Good to meet you.
And Gustavo Fring of Los Polios Hermanos.
Please, just Gus.
Hi, Gus.
You guys make some killer chicken.
Thank you very much.
These gentlemen are underwriting this year's Fun Run...
...and I thought I would give them a tour.
Absolutely. Get to see what you're supporting. Thank you.
Can you tell us a little about your work here?
Yes, the Albuquerque office...
...covers everything from drug-related money laundering...
...to interdiction of illicit substances crossing the border.
Now, the group that I supervise focuses on methamphetamine...
...which is a growing problem in the country, unfortunately.
Terrible.
Yeah. It is indeed.
We've had some successes locally...
...but overall, the supply seems to be growing.
I gotta tell you, community outreach, like this Fun Run...
...one of the most powerful weapons we have.
Anything we can do.
Thank you.
Thank you, Hank.
Gentlemen.
Thanks.
Sure. Thank you.
Is this one of your agents?
Oh, yeah, no, no, that's my brother-in-law.
He's got a health issue. We're trying to--
Oh, I'm very sorry. What sort of health issue?
Lung cancer.
Oh, that's a rough one.
Oh, hey, you don't have to do that.
Please. Please. I'm happy to do it.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Just so you know, I won't be back for a while.
I'm gonna have my surgery on Friday.
I'm hopeful it'll go well.
But if not, Saul will take care of things.
He's got your money. He's keeping it for you.
Look, Jesse, lingering on things doesn't help, believe me.
Just try and focus on getting better, okay.
I deserve this.
What?
What you said in the desert.
I get it, what you meant.
I deserve whatever happens.
Oh, shit.
There he is!
Walt, they're doing a feature on Walter Jr.
We called you about 50 times.
Marie, I thought we were just talking about a newspaper story.
<i>I know. But I thought, you know, if it's good enough for the Journal...</i>
...then why not TV? So I went for it.
This is him?
Yes.
This is Dad. Great.
Let's get everyone on the couch. I'm thinking Walt Jr. in the middle...
...Mom and Dad on either side.
Mom and Dad?
How much money have you raised so far?
Six thousand, three hundred and sixty dollars.
But there's more coming in all the time.
Wow, that's amazing.
We don't even know what to say.
It's just-- It's been incredible.
Judging from things you have written about him...
...your dad must be quite a guy.
Yeah. He is. He's the best.
You don't wanna lose him, do you, Walter?
None of us do. We love him.
He's a good man, isn't he?
Absolutely. Ask anyone.
Anybody. He's a great father, a great teacher.
He knows everything there is to know about chemistry.
He's patient with you, and he's always there for you.
He's just decent.
And he always does the right thing.
And that's how he teaches me to be.
Would you say he's your hero?
Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. Totally.
My dad is my hero.
Does that put him to sleep?
This one just relaxes him a little.
We're almost ready. We'll be taking you in, in just a minute.
Okay. Thank you.
Well...
Here we are.
Yeah.
Relaxed yet?
As a matter of fact...
I don't know what this stuff is, but it's pretty great.
Yeah, it looks like it.
We'll be here when you wake up.
Well, I'll be looking for you.
They'll probably want me to take your glasses.
Yeah, you better.
Yeah, okay. Okay. I got them.
Where's your phone?
Your cell phone. Did you bring it?
Which one?
I'm pretty sure he didn't bring it, Mom.
Okay.
Well, first things first.
How old is that baby now? When do I get to meet her?
I was actually thinking of bringing her today, but...
She's 7 weeks tomorrow.
Seven, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture...
...here somewhere.
She's beautiful.
Thanks.
Always a relief to say that and actually mean it.
How's your pain level, Walter?
It's...
Very low, basically.
Shortness of breath?
A bit, but much better.
Good.
Well, your margins look good.
I can't foresee the future...
...but even conservatively speaking...
...I can say that you bought yourself some real time here.
There's no reason not to be optimistic.
That's great.
That is great. Thank you, doctor.
So when could he get back to his normal routine?
He can ease into it now.
Okay.
And can he go back to work or...?
I'd give it a few more weeks.
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting and continue to get plenty of rest.
But he can be on his own?
I mean, just more, you know, independent.
Yes. Use your best judgment.
Well...
Now, that's good news for you, huh, honey?
One less baby in the house.
Don, hey.
Hey, Stew.
Hey, welcome back.
Thanks. It's good to be back.
Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear.
Yes. Thanks.
Terrible thing. Just...
But, you know, we've all been thinking about you, and...
You been doing okay?
I'm doing okay.
After a certain point, time off doesn't help...
...so I figured I'd rather be here.
Focus on work.
Sure. Absolutely.
Yeah.
Well, see you inside.

Sky?
What do you think?
Doesn't look so bad, right?
What are you doing?
I'm going to Hank and Marie's for the weekend.
Since when?
I'm taking the baby with me.
Marie will pick up Walter Jr. from school.
You'll have the house to yourself for two days.
I want you to pack your things and leave.
Why would I do that?
Hank has offered to help. You shouldn't be doing any heavy lifting.
Skyler.
I want you gone by Monday morning.
I want--
I want you gone.
Okay. Can you at least tell me why?
Because you're a liar, Walt.
Two cell phones, after all.
What?
Before your surgery, I asked if you had packed your cell phone...
...and you said, "Which one?"
When?
Skyler, I was medicated.
I mean, I could have said the world was flat.
You know what I think?
I think you accidentally told the truth.
Honey, we have been over this.
Asked and answered, right?
Then it got me thinking again...
...about all the strange behaviour.
Not the least of which was the disappearance.
Out of my mind with worry, calling hospitals...
...checking the morgue.
Your fugue state?
I had to believe that, didn't I?
I had to find a way.
I mean, who would lie about such a thing?
You tell me, Skyler.
You tell me exactly what it is you think I'm lying about.
What? I'm having an affair. Is that what you think?
Yeah. For the last few weeks.
With whom? Who am I having an affair with?
Well, my guess was Gretchen Schwartz.
Something was going on between you. I just knew.
Jesus. Skyler. Get me a Bible to swear on, if that's what it takes.
I am not having an affair with Gretchen.
I know. I know you're not. Because I asked her.
It really took me forever to get in touch with her.
She was ducking my calls for weeks.
So I finally left a message:
"What exactly is going on between you and my husband?"
I thought that'd get her attention, and it did.
So she called me back, and she finally told me.
The money for your treatment...
...Gretchen and Elliott didn't give you a dime.
They paid for nothing.
You refused every offer they made you.
But that didn't make sense...
...because I checked with Delcavoli and the hospital...
...and not including your surgery...
...we're nearly paid up.
Over $100,000.
Out of where? Out of thin air?
But then...
...I called your mother.
Yeah.
Thanks for that too.
But I thought, you know, maybe she has some money...
...that I don't know about. Maybe she contributed.
It's possible.
It turns out that not only is the money not from your mother...
...she didn't even know that you have cancer.
You never went to see her.
I dropped you at the airport. I picked you up.
You were gone for four days...
...and yet she swears...
...that you were never there.
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.
Skyler.
Could you...
...just once...
...do me the courtesy of not denying it?
Skyler.
Skyler, don't do this, please.
I...
Skyler, please don't go.
If I tell you the truth, will you stay?
Stay, and I will tell you everything.
Whatever it is...
...I'm afraid to know.

We interrupt scheduled programming to bring you this breaking news.
Good afternoon. In the last several minutes...
...KOB has received dozens of reports...
...of what appears to be a crashed aircraft, possibly two aircraft...
...on Albuquerque's east side.
As of yet details are scarce...
...but callers describe witnessing an explosion overhead...
...followed by falling debris. Visible now...
crash investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board...
...are expected on site as early as this evening.
But officials warn...
...that with a debris field of this magnitude, the investigation...
Officials are now saying that the Boeing 737...
...was being re-routed, or vectored, through the airspace...
...which is standard procedure according to a spokesman for the FAA.
The eight-seat King Air 350 was a charter flight...
...operating out of St. George, Utah, bound for Amarillo, Texas.
It sounded like hail, like heavy hailstones.
It was just bump-bump-bump, all over the neighborhood...
indicating that the final death toll now stands at 167.
One hundred and sixty-seven.
This mid-air collision has left many wondering...
...how such an accident could take place...
...in a system with so many safeguards.
That the collision which brought down Flight 515...
...was caused by improper air traffic control.
We have the bombshell confirmation out of Oklahoma City...
...as the FAA confirmed...
...it was indeed a lone air traffic controller's fateful mistake...
...which brought about the crash.
Is Donald Margolis, a 19-year veteran...
...of the FAA's Air Route Traffic Control Center in Albuquerque...
Margolis recently returned to work after a five-week absence...
...which was due to, quote, "a personal loss".
While it's now known that Margolis had recently lost a daughter to a...
drug overdose a month before.
His troubled daughter Jane Margolis, aged 26...
...apparently had a long history of substance abuse.
Friends of the family say...
...the death of his only child hit Margolis particularly hard.
Coming as it did little more than a month before...
...many are questioning the timing of his return to work...
...and are wondering how much blame truly lies...
...with those who let this grieving father...
I usually open with "So sorry you're here."
Where would you like to begin?
I really just need this quick and easy, you know?
As quick as something like this can be. So...
Okay. Is that mutual? Does your husband go along with that?
Does he know?
Well, I mean, he certainly knows we're separated, so...
Has he moved out?
We're in the process of moving him out.
Yeah. Today, hopefully.
And in the meantime, my son and my daughter...
...and I are staying with my sister.
So you've moved out?
Well, yes, just temporarily.
Only so he could get his things and...
That was supposed to happen last week, but then came the crash and...
Oh, God, you weren't one of the...?
Right, yeah. Right beneath the flight path.
And we had debris land in our yard, and all over our neighborhood, so...
Terrible.
Yeah. Apparently, even...
...you know, parts of bodies.
So I certainly couldn't bring myself to...
So awful.
I know.
Anyway, I was certainly not ready to move back. But it's time.
And I'm sure we're driving my sister and her husband up a wall.
Well, you definitely wanna maintain residency in your actual home.
It just puts you in a better position in regards to custody.
Two children, you said?
Yes. Holly here, and then I have a son in high school, Walter Jr.
They need to stay with me.
Okay.
How long have you been married?
Sixteen years.
And it's not an apartment, it's a house that you live in?
Do you own outright, do you have a mortgage?
Yes, there's definitely a mortgage. We have maybe 15 years on it.
What about other debts or assets?
Do you feel you have a good understanding...
...of you and your husband's financial situation?
Is your husband employed?
Here's the thing.
I'm really not looking for any sort of loopholes...
...or I don't know, just...
No, no loopholes.
I just intend that every one of my clients get a full and honest accounting...
...of what it is they owe and what it is they own.
To that end, I say let's leave no stone unturned.
You'd be amazed what I've seen partners hide from one another.
Walt?
Hey, buddy?
Hey, Walt?
Hey.
There you are.
Listen, I... You know, well...
It's...
It's time.
The shittiest week since 9/11, okay? Bar none.
This is it. Hands down, we're living it.
I speak with authority...
...because we had some shitty weeks the past few months.
But this here? I mean...
...call freaking Guinness Book of World Records, call freaking...
Am I talking too much? I am, right? I am, I know.
But this situation between you and... You know, I don't know.
I'm not asking, by the way. It's none of my business.
I do not wanna get in the middle of you two.
I'm just saying, listen, okay?
You beat a little tactical retreat...
...you regroup, and then:
You know, absence makes the... Yeah.
I'm pulling for you, man. I'm pulling for you.
No heavy lifting. I got it.
No, it's okay.
I got it.
Jesus. What do you got in there, cinder blocks?
Half a million in cash.
That's the spirit.
I got it, I got it.
Who's here for self-improvement?
Come on, give me a show of hands.
Who among you is here hoping they can actively improve who they are?
All right. See, that's your first mistake.
You should be here to learn self-acceptance.
Hey, honey, you want another waffle?
I still got the iron out. I could cut up some bananas.
Hi, you've reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn and Holly. Please leave us a message.
Hey. Hello, everybody. Good morning.
I was just checking in...
...and thought I'd pass along the current contact information.
You certainly can always reach me on my cell...
...I've always got that on me, but in terms of a mailing address...
...I'm here at the Beachcomber...
...and you know what, it's actually very nice, very pleasant.
Not as high-end as the Oakwood, but not as corporate...
Oh, hey, would you please just...?
Hey, Dad, it's me.
No, I'm not okay.
I don't know what's going on.
Nobody's telling me jackshit around here.
Hey, Flynn.
Whatever.
I don't even care anymore.
Can you just give me a ride to school?
I'll take you to school.
Yeah. No, I'm ready now.
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.
All right, I'm here. See you soon.
Okay.
May I have your attention, please?
As all of you know, last week our city suffered a terrible tragedy.
One that none of us will ever forget.
Which is why today we're going to take a little time out of our schedule...
...to gather in the gym and talk.
I just find it, you know, really, really hard to concentrate.
Because of all the horrors, you know, we perceived.
It just really gets inside your brain and...
In college, they have this thing where if your roommate kills himself...
...like, if you come home and find him hanging in the closet or whatever...
...it's basically an automatic A for you.
And I just think that that kind of compassion is...
Is something to...
Okay. Thank you, Barry.
Who wants to go next?
No judgments, guys. Just feelings.
You can say anything and everything that's on your mind. Anyone?
There you go, honey.
I just keep asking myself...
Honey, could you please stand up?
Thank you.
I just keep asking myself, "Why did this happen?"
I mean, if there's a God and all...
...why does he allow all those innocent people to die for no reason?
Okay, can we just keep it secular, honey?
Anyhow, I haven't really been sleeping much.
Does anyone else have that?
I just keep hearing that sound.
That boom.
It just plays over and over in my head like it won't ever stop.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Is there anyone else?
Over here.
My neighbor, he heard the crash...
...and he ran outside, and he found, like, this seat.
Like an airline seat.
Like what you have on an airliner?
Well, anyway, the seat was standing perfectly upright in his front yard...
...right next to his Sea-Doos, because, like, he has Sea-Doos.
But there was still a pair of legs buckled into them.
Human legs.
Jesus H. Christ.
You okay?
Yeah, sorry. I'm...
I was just moved.
Maybe we should hear from the faculty.
Certainly this tragedy didn't only affect our students.
Mr. White, would you like to say something?
And by the way, welcome back.
It's so good to have you back.
I guess what I would... Sorry, sorry.
I guess what I would wanna say is...
...to look on the bright side.
First of all, nobody on the ground was killed.
And that...
I mean, an incident like this, over a populated urban center?
That right there, that's just gotta be some minor miracle. So...
Plus, neither plane was full.
You know, the 737 was, what, maybe two-thirds full, I believe? Right, yes?
Or maybe even three-quarters full?
Well, at any rate, what you're left with casualty-wise...
...is just the 50th-worst air disaster.
Actually, tied for 50th.
There are, in truth...
...53 crashes throughout history...
...that are just as bad or worse. Tenerife.
Has anybody? Anybody hear of Tenerife? No?
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s...
...crashed into each other on Tenerife.
Does anybody know how big a 747 is?
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737, and we're talking about two of them.
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.
But do any of you even remember it at all? Any of you? I doubt it.
You know why? It's because people move on.
They just move on.
And we will too. We will move on, and we will get past this.
Because that is what human beings do, we survive, and...
We survive and we overcome. Yeah.
We survive. We survive and...
Okay?
Thank you.
Good.
Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?
Fine. I guess.
You make sure you say hello to her for me, will you?
Why don't you just come inside? It's your house.
No, I...
He's gone.
Hey, Flynn. How's tricks?
How's what?
Tricks. It's an expression.
How are you?
Why you gotta treat him like this?
Why you gotta be like this?
Why can't you just talk even?
Hey, hey, hey. Cool down, okay?
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?
You know, try not to hold it against him.
You know, I mean, the poor kid, he's probably just dying of curiosity.
You know, and I guess it would be natural for him to wonder.
He's probably wondering, "What is it that could have gone so wrong...
Marie. Marie. ...that my mother would leave...?"
I can't help you get through this...
...you know, if you won't tell me what it is that Walt did?
Well, you know what, I don't remember asking you, all right?
So if you wanna be supportive, you could be supportive without prying.
That would be really great...
"Prying."
...and so helpful.
Well, prying's a strong word.
It's that voice inside your head.
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard, 24/7 voice.
You know what I'm talking about.
That voice that tells you you're not good enough.
Not good enough for what? Not good enough to be what...
...president of the United States?
Well, okay, so maybe you're not that good.
But now...
...are you good enough to deserve your share of basic human happiness?
Are you good enough to be okay with who and what you are?
I say yes.
But it doesn't matter what I say.
It's your voice, which means you're the one that hears it.
Which means you're the only one that can fight it, right?
Jesse, we never hear from you.
What's going on? You can tell me I'm full of shit. It's okay, I don't mind.
Just come on. Let us in on it.
So, like, what makes you the expert?
I don't think I ever said I was that.
Yeah, but you're the one sitting here, right?
Telling us "thus" and "so," "be happy," "forgive yourself," blah, blah, blah.
Have you ever really hurt anybody?
I don't just mean disappointed your mother or whatever...
...but did you ever really hurt someone?
I killed my daughter.
It was July 18th, which is my birthday.
July 18th, 1992.
I was high on cocaine and I was drunk.
Cocaine wasn't an issue. I had bought myself two grams as a birthday present.
I had plenty left.
But I was out of vodka.
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia...
...where instead of selling liquor in the supermarkets...
...they have these ABC stores...
...which close at 5 p.m., and right then it was like 4:42.
So I'm arguing with my wife.
"Come on. Go to the ABC for me, it's my birthday.
Come on. They're not gonna sell it to me."
And she's saying "No, no."
So I'm pissed. And the clock is ticking, so I jump in my truck.
She's my 6-year-old daughter.
She's playing at the end of the driveway.
So...
How do you not hate yourself?
I did hate myself for a long time.
But it didn't stop me from drinking and getting high.
It just made it that much worse.
Self-hatred, guilt, it accomplishes nothing.
It just stands in the way.
Stands in the way of what?
True change.
Skyler.
Is this a good time to talk?
Yeah. Come in. Please.
Skyler.
Do you wanna start?
Okay.
Why are you doing this? Why are you even thinking this way?
Is it to punish me?
I am not punishing you, Walt.
This is punitive, is what this is. We are happily married.
I am happily married. I am happy. We're just...
I love you, Skyler. And I would do anything for you.
Would you even consider? I mean, Jesus!
You come in here and you wave these papers in my face...
...when there's a whole other, entire side to this thing.
There's your side and there's my side, and you haven't heard my side yet.
You haven't heard any of it at all.
You're a drug dealer.
No. What...? How? What?
Yeah.
How else could you possibly make that kind of money?
Marijuana. That Pinkman kid.
No?
Oh, my God, Walt.
Cocaine?
It's methamphetamine.
But I'm a manufacturer, I'm not a dealer...
...per se.
It doesn't mean... No, Skyler!
Listen to me. Skyler, listen...
No, no!
There are a lot of angles to this, okay? It's complicated, all right?
So please, let's... Please, let's just sit back down and talk it through.
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.
I won't tell Hank and I won't tell your children or anybody else.
Nobody will hear it from me.
But only if you grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives.
No, Skyler...
I mean it.
Now let me the hell out of here before I throw up.
Bye, Jesse.
Your windshield's broken.
Yeah.
Little friction in the marriage right now.
Strictly temporary. We're just...
We're just taking a little break.
That's you, over there.
Listen, money.
Saul has got it for you, so as soon as you're feeling better...
I'm better.
You're better? Really?
What, the rehab? It helped?
Yeah. I'm done using.
That's excellent. That's...
That's very good, Jesse. Boy, very good.
You know, in spite of how bad things got...
...it really could be looked at like a wake-up call for both of us.
I mean, you know, just to get our lives back together again...
...and on the straight and narrow.
You been following this airplane crash?
Yeah.
You know it was Jane's dad who accidentally crashed them together...
...because he was so torn up?
Okay, look, let me stop you right there, all right?
You are not responsible for this.
Not in any way, shape or form, all right?
Now, I am very up-to-date on this thing, probably far more than you are...
...and there are many factors at play there.
Yeah?
For instance, there's some sort of collision radar on the jet...
...that may not have been working.
That's public record. You can look that up.
And the whole system is run on 1960s technology.
No.
No, really, I blame the government.
You either run from things or you face them, Mr. White.
What exactly does that mean?
I learned it in rehab.
It's all about accepting who you really are.
I accept who I am.
And who are you?
I'm the bad guy.
Here's some napkins for you.
Enjoy.
Is the food to your satisfaction?
Very much.
It's good to see you again.
May I?
Please.
I have an offer that I think will be of interest to you.
I actually am not here to...
I'm here because I owe you the courtesy and respect...
...to tell you this personally.
I'm done.
It has nothing to do with you personally.
I find you extraordinarily professional...
...and I appreciate the way you do business.
I'm just making a change in my life, is what it is.
And I'm... I'm at something of a crossroads...
...and it's brought me to a realization.
I am not a criminal.
No offense to any people who are...
...but this is not me.
I'd like you to hear my offer, notwithstanding.
It won't change my mind, I'm sorry.
Three million dollars for three months of your time.
Three months, then out.
Three million?
May I take this as a "yes"?
I have money. I have more money than I know how to spend.
What I don't have is my family.
The answer is still no.
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.
That's it!
Did you feel it?
Texas!
I've made this trip three times...
...and every time there's three big bumps...
...and that's how you know!
We are officially in Texas!
This time I got a job waiting for me.
I got a cousin who's got a body shop.
Yo, that's for me, homes!
They call me "Olive Oil" because I paint them slick.
I do pearlescent, color-shift, you name it.
I painted cars for some of...
...the biggest gangsters in MichoacÃ¡n.
Wow, those are beautiful boots!
Not much good for working, but...
Hey, what's on the toes there? Little silver...
What the hell's going on in there?

Good morning, officer.
Can you turn the music down?
Oh, okay.
Down means off.
You know why I pulled you over this morning?
Well, I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding.
I've been using the cruise control, so I don't...
No, sir, your windshield.
License and registration, please.
Right.
This... This was from Wayfarer 515.
My house was in the debris field.
Okay.
And that's what shattered my windshield...
...some piece of wreckage from the plane.
I understand.
You know of flight 515, the plane crash? You're wearing the ribbon.
Yes, sir. I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.
I was one of the first responders on the scene.
Then what are you doing?
Citing you, sir.
What? What, you don't believe me?
Regardless of how that windshield was damaged...
...this car is unsafe to drive in this condition. Stay in the car, please.
Wait. Wait just a minute. Just one minute.
I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
I can get out of my own car.
Sir, listen...
No, you listen to me.
It's time for you to listen to me.
Take a deep breath, calm down.
This is America, okay?
Get back in that car.
I have rights. You understand that?
At least have the common decency to hear me out.
Step back now.
Did you even hear what I said?
Sir, calm down.
You're giving me a ticket?
I told you that my house was in the debris field.
Do you have the remotest inkling of what that means?
Sir, calm down.
Hellfire rained down on my house...
...where my children sleep!
I need you to step back now.
There were body parts in my yard!
Are you kidding me?!
Sir, last warning.
You got two seconds to stand down.
Or?
I'm gonna pepper-spray you.
Pepper-spray me. That is just perfect.
Pepper-spray the man who's expressing his opinion under the First Amendment!
Lastly a little something from down El Paso way.
Border Patrol came across multiple homicides just this side of the border.
Truck turns out to be a chicken run out of Juarez into Laredo.
Border Patrol's been playing hide-and-seek...
...with these polleros for two years.
But this time, soon as they made it across, someone hit them.
Hit them hard.
We're talking a driver and nine illegals. No sign of the shooters.
So this truck was carrying more than just people.
What are we looking at, weed, coke or meth?
No, doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics.
Why'd the Border Patrol kick this to us?
They didn't. I pulled it.
You ask me, this is high-end cartel work. Los Zetas, maybe.
Question is, why do we have Juarez-style action...
...on our side of the DMZ?
They sending a message? Clearing a path?
Or was this about stopping one particular border-hopper?
Maybe one of those extra-crispies knew something he shouldn't.
Anyway, keep your eyes open.
All right, that's it. Slow news day.
Add one more to the countdown.
Oh, yeah? What's that, Gomey?
We're waiting on that famous blue meth of yours.
Twenty-nine days since we saw it last.
It's still out there, Gomey. Don't worry.
Local P.D. I gotta take this.
Gomey, go beat your piÃ±ata.
Rest of you jokers, too damn quiet in here.
Catch some bad guys.
Schrader.
Hey, what's up, Walt?
What?
Jesse?
Hey, Dad.
Fixing up the house, huh?
Doing a little work, yeah.
Well, I'll bounce. It's cool.
You doing okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
I just happened to be driving by and saw the sign.
So you're selling the place.
In this market. Can you believe it?
I see you moved the garage. That's bold.
Your mother's idea. It's quite an operation.
We did all new stucco, all new master suite...
...sandblasted, fumigated the basement.
Right on.
Yeah.
You know, fixing up the place totally increases resale value.
I read that in, I wanna say, like TIME magazine.
So, what'd you do with the upstairs bathroom?
All redone. New tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens...
...granite countertops, new appliances. All top-of-the line.
Damn. That's great, Dad. Think I can get a tour?
These guys are trying to finish up. Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.
There are pictures on the website, if you want to take a look.
Cool.
You're looking healthy.
I'll tell your mother. She'll be happy.
Thanks.
You know, I could come by sometime for dinner or something.
Yeah. Sometime.
Okay.
Later, Dad.
You know, look, he's a high-school teacher.
He's never been in trouble a day in his life.
He finds out he's got lung cancer...
...and now his wife kicks the poor bastard out of his own house.
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates a little slack, here's the guy.
Hey, Walt. Remember Officer Cavanaugh?
Officer, I'm very sorry that I lost my temper.
There's no excuse for my behavior. It was disrespectful.
Yeah. Thanks, man.
She's divorcing me.
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
It is what it is.
She doesn't want me to see the kids.
She said that?
Yeah.
You don't write, you don't call.
God.
It's a disaster.
It is not a disaster.
Oh, okay.
It's not a disaster, all right?
She's not going to the cops, she's not gonna tell a living soul.
You wanna know why? One word: Blowback.
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster, for her.
That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed. You were right under his nose.
He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.
The kids? Paging Dr. Phil.
My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in.
And the house? Gone. Feds would RICO her and the kids out on the street.
Good luck arguing with them on that. No. It's not gonna happen.
She's bluffing and she knows it.
Her going to the police is not the point, Saul.
She's out of my life. Do you understand?
I've lost my family. Everything that I care about.
Hey, buddy.
It's bad. It's a calamity.
Oh, my God.
But we live to fight another day.
And after a decent interval of time...
...well, there are other fish in the sea.
You've been out of circulation for a while.
You'll be just amazed at what's out there.
Thailand, the Czech Republic.
I mean, those women are so grateful to even be here.
In the meantime, idle hands are the devil's plaything.
So why don't you get back on the horse and do what you do best?
First step: Talk to our friend and get cooking.
I can't be the bad guy.
What?
I can't be the bad guy.
Okay.
You know, we'll revisit.
Just promise me you won't hang yourself in the closet.
Pop-pop!
Pop-pop, the ice cream man!
Don't tell your mom.
Okay.
Yeah.
It's me. We may have a wife problem.
Look, I need eyes on it.
You got an address?
Hey. Dinner's gonna be late.
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie are bringing takeout...
...but if you're hungry, I could rustle something up.
Hey, buddy, pass the ketchup, will you?
What? I've had enough trans-fat for one lifetime.
Two-day drive from the nearest ocean...
...and you're eating raw fish. That's all I'm saying.
Been awhile since that minnow's been swimming. Right, buddy?
Yeah.
You know, Flynn here is looking for a part-time job...
...so, I don't know, if you know of anything you might want to...
My name's Walter Jr.
Like, what, you can't even say his name?
If you've changed your mind about being called Flynn...
...all you need to do is just tell me that you don't want to be called Flynn.
Dad didn't even show up till fourth period.
And his eyes were all red, like he's been crying or something.
But you, you don't even care!
And now he won't even drive me home.
He won't say why, but I know it's because you told him not to.
Honey, I...
What?
I don't know what your problem is.
You may not love him anymore, but I do.
I mean, why you gotta be...? Why you gotta be such a bitch?!
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
Oh, God.
You can't talk to your mom like that.
Hank, no. Hank. Hank, it's...
It's all right.
Hey, hey.
Skyler, I know that you must have your reasons for all of this.
Sky, the...
I know it's none of my business...
...but keeping Walt from the kids? I mean...
You're right, Hank.
It's none of your business.
Oh, my God. After all of that?
Please, tell me that you are still not curious.
There's nothing to be curious about.
Oh, please.
The day I heard the words "second cell phone," I knew.
Believe me. Seen it a hundred times.
Okay. All right.
So, what? Stop dancing around it.
What is it exactly that you have seen a hundred times?
Please, please, enlighten me.
Look, a guy like Walt? Nice guy, decent, smart.
But, let's face it, underachiever, dead-end life, okay?
He gets cancer. Time's running out. Mid-life crisis.
He acts up. He steps out.
And the wife, she catches him. I mean, it's a story as old as time.
Look, do the math, Marie. It only comes out one way.
Knowing Walt, he felt so guilty, he probably told her himself.
I... I don't know.
I think if he cheated on her, that she would have told me by now.
It just feels like something more.
Yes, yes, yes, 24/7 coverage. Need you ask?
How much is this gonna run me?
Jesus, I'm in the wrong business.
Yeah, I'll call you.
Return of the prodigal, back to the land of the living.
How you feeling?
I'm good.
Of course you are. The world's your oyster. Am I right?
Unencumbered young man with stacks of cash.
Hey, I'm jealous. Hand to God, I'm jealous.
Speaking of cash, you know what's giving me heartburn lately?
Your former partner. This guy, he works like a bastard, right?
Builds a business single-handed.
Finally the big money shows up and what does he do? He walks out.
Talent like that and he flushes it down the crapper.
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.
Look, I know you're out of it and all...
...but you wouldn't talk to him, would you?
Help him pull his head out of his ass?
All right, all right, scratch that.
Yeah, he won't listen to me, he's not gonna listen to you.
All due respect.
You want a job?
A job?
Who's got a job for me?
I do.
There you go.
Hey.
Hey.
Thought I'd...
...well, visit, if you don't mind.
Of course not.
You don't need the room, do you?
No, no, no.
I just needed some more space to spread out.
Wanted to say hello to little Holly.
Hey, girl. Hi, baby. Oh, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Oh, yeah.
She's a beauty. Look at her.
Hey, thanks for being so flexible on me coming in.
I just wish we had you back full-time. You do brighten up the place.
Listen, believe me, this is...
I don't want to bring this up, but I can't sign off on these quarterlies.
I'm sorry, I just can't.
Is that right?
If you're gonna do this, it can't be so glaring.
Glaring.
Okay.
That does sound bad. Show me what's bothering you.
Keller.
Again. Oh, God, I'm sorry. I know how you feel about this.
Revenue with no backup.
Here, here and here. I don't even know what to say.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, okay. This is fixable, right?
How about if I just push 28,800...
...out of this into next quarter? Would you sign it then?
I'm just saying I can't sign it as it currently exists.
Fair enough.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you for the heads-up.
You won't have to deal with this again, I swear.
What if your kids found out?
If my kids found out?
This. What you're doing.
Someday they're gonna be old enough. How would you explain it to them?
Well, put me on the spot, why don't you?
I guess maybe I'd...
I'd say that I might have feet of clay...
...but that whatever I did, I did thinking of them.
You know, trying to provide.
And I'd ask them to try to take the time to understand...
You know what? Truth is, I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.
I'm just trying to keep my head above water, so...
I'd better get back to it.
Oh, God.
Hi, Walt.
Listen, I can't tal... I'm at work right now...
What?
Louis dropped him off. He was here when I got home.
No, no, no, of course.
No, he's not staying. He understands that.
I'll bring him anywhere you want.
Dad.
Well, yeah. It is rush hour.
I mean, I could fight traffic and bring him down to Beneke now.
But wouldn't it be easier if we...?
Right, okay, good. So we'll meet you at the house.
Okay, bye.
Why are you doing this?
She's just trying to keep me from seeing you and you're helping her.
Well, son, I mean, your mother, she has her reasons.
What reasons?
They're...
Well, they're...
Well, they're just a little difficult to delineate.
But, I mean, yes, there are two sides to every story, always.
But she...
Yeah.
This is just how it has to be for now, okay?
Now, look, your home is your home and that is where you belong, all right?
But it's where you belong. Dad, it's your house.
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie...
...everybody knows that you haven't done anything wrong.
Everybody is on your side.
Well, it's not about taking sides, though.
How can you let her treat you like this?
Come on.
How can you just take it?
Now just listen to me, okay?
No matter what, all of this has nothing to do with how we feel about you, okay?
We both love you very, very much, okay?
You and your sister will come first always.
Come on.
Let's try to see this in a positive light, okay? Both of us.
Let's just buck up.
And I'll take you home.
Let me first just hit the old bathroom here.
Hello. Good afternoon.
Nice to meet you. Saul Goodman.
Nice to meet you.
You're not that lawyer on late-night television, are you?
Better call Saul!
I get it all the time.
We're here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 Margo.
I get it. Flat-fee clients, am I right?
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.
I represent a client who shall remain nameless.
However, for our purposes...
...you might just as well visualize a large bag of money.
This individual wants to buy your house today for cash.
Cash?
Cash. I know, in this economy.
The money is already burning a hole in my client's account.
You can ask Mr. Gardiner. I've shown him all the pertinent financials.
It's the only reason we're sitting here.
Fair enough. We get a few papers signed and notarized...
...we can take care of this right now.
In fact, I could wire you your money this very afternoon.
There's just one little hair in the soup.
The price.
We feel 875 is very fair.
But I suppose there's always a little wiggle room.
Well, why don't you wiggle us on down to 400 and you got yourselves a deal?
Four hundred thousand? What is that, a joke?
No, that's my offer.
That's less than half-price.
We put that much into the renovations alone.
Why don't we just cut the clown act...
...and you tell us what you're willing to come up to?
Four hundred thousand. That's my final offer.
Waste of time.
Ridiculous.
How could you possibly imagine we'd entertain this?
Come on, hon.
I don't know.
I thought some allowance was in order once I heard about the meth lab.
That used to be in the basement.
I looked over your signed disclosure statements...
...and I don't see any mention of a meth lab. Nope.
Oh, you got your termite inspection. That's good.
But no meth lab.
Now, some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony.
I, myself, am more open-minded. But it is tricky.
Now, don't get me wrong. I applaud your cojones.
I mean, good try...
...at sneaking a meth-contaminated property past a buyer.
I mean, could've been a good deal for you. Too bad.
Now, I could file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely.
Or I could start some criminal proceedings.
But I don't think any of us want that, now, do we?
How about it, counselor? Do you concur?
There you go, son.
Come on. It's not Devil's Island.
Okay.
Oh, hey.
Hello.
Brought pizza.
Yeah. Well, I'm making dinner.
Okay, I'll just put it in the fridge. It's even better the next day.
Hi, honey.
Sorry.
Skyler.
I mean, what kind of example do we want to set here, right?
I mean, can't we at least just sit down and eat a piece of pizza together?
Just hash things out like adults?
We have discussed everything we need to discuss.
I thought I made myself very clear.
I got dipping sticks.
You've reached Walt's temporary number.
Please, leave a message.
When I went out this morning to get the newspaper...
...I saw a pizza on our roof.
Would you know anything about that?
Listen to me, Walt. You need to control yourself.
Calm down, accept the situation and keep your distance.
If you can't manage that, I will get a restraining order.
Skyler. Skyler.
Got your restraining order right here! Restrain this!
Breaking even is not so bad.
In this economy, a lot of people would kill to break even.
Poor Jake. He had his heart set on going to Space Camp.
Oh, no.
Oh, God. This is all we need.
Hey, Mom, Dad. How's it going?
Jesse, it's really not a good time.
Come on.
Jesse, the house has been sold.
The new owners are expected at any moment.
Where do you think you're going?
Inside.
I bought the place.
Be back by seven, okay?
Love you.
Bye.
No!
Oh, God.
It's me. There's something he should know about.
Hold on.
ï»¿1
More.
Another.
Careful, seÃ±or.
Hot day like today...
...too much oil in the machine...
...can cause it to blow a gasket.
There are two kinds of men in this world.
Those who drink...
...and those who pour.
Shut up and fill my glass.
Hey, you two.
Yes, you.
I used to be just like you.
Worked dirt for the man till my hands bled.
But no more.
Because I learned that a man can never drink his fill...
...by waiting in line for the tap.
Listen to him.
He can teach you something!
Hey, how you doing, boss?
Good to see you, my friend.
You know, I never pegged you for such a deep thinker.
I keep thinking I should write a book.
Maybe, maybe...
So, what brings you to this burro's asshole of a town?
I knew I would find you here.
Don't you have something to deliver?
Cutting it close, aren't you?
Lots of time.
Tortuga may be slow out of the gate, but he always...
Finishes first.
Yes, I know. Just like your namesake.
I like the way you talk, Tortuga.
Yeah?
You've got such a way with words.
They flow like a waterfall.
I like that about you.
I'm so stupid. I missed your birthday.
No, I feel terrible.
So bad I came all the way here to this burro's asshole...
...to give you your present.
Present?
Come on, boss. No need to go through the trouble.
Forget it, I wanted to.
I have it for you in the back.
Back there?
Yes. Come. Follow me.
It's perfect!
Do you really like it?
I love it!
What a great pet it will make.
Thank you, boss!
Excellent.
Let me sign it for you.
Let me sign it...
..."For the big talker."
He's still breathing.
Well, by the looks of him, he has no idea how close he came.
I'm assuming Saul Goodman doesn't need to know.
Mum's the word.
Son of a bitch.
Hang on, baby.
Hello.
Walt? Are you in the house?
Oh, hey, Skyler. Yeah, it's me.
What? What the hell are you doing in there?
I'm back.
No, no, you're not back, Walt.
You're not back. Get... Get out of there.
Well, it's my house too, Skyler.
No...
I'm staying. End of story.
We had an agreement.
I didn't agree to anything.
Now, look, just come on inside and we'll talk this through, okay?
No. No. There's nothing to talk about.
I am not coming in there until you get out.
Well, suit yourself.
Walt.
Walt?
What is wrong with you?
Skyler, I have every right to be here.
No, you don't.
You don't live here anymore. We're getting a divorce.
I don't agree to a divorce.
Well, it's not up to you.
If you don't get out of here right now, I'm gonna call the police...
...and I'm going to tell them everything.
I mean it, Walt.
There's the phone.
It's ringing.
Albuquerque Police Department.
Operator number 314. How may I help you?
Albuquerque Police Department. How may I help you?
Yes, I want to report a disturbance, please.
No, no, it's not... It's not exactly, it's...
It's a domestic issue.
Okay.
They're connecting me.
Right hand to God, I will tell them.
Do what you have to do, Skyler.
This family is everything to me.
Without it, I have nothing to lose.
Fine.
Yes. My name is Skyler White.
I need police assistance at my home right away.
My soon-to-be-ex-husband broke into my house...
...and I need an officer to come and remove him.
It's 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.
Okay. Okay.
Thank you.
They're coming.
Dad's here?
Great, he's home.
Dad.
Hey, son.
How are you?
Are you back for good?
Why are you home so soon?
I'm not.
Hey, I am starving. How about a grilled cheese?
Sure.
You want one too?
Walter, your dad and I have something we need to discuss.
When your sandwich is ready, I'll bring it to your room.
Mom, can't it wait? I haven't seen Dad in, like, forever.
Walter?
How was school?
It was good.
Yeah? Homework?
No, not really.
Not really? What does that mean?
So are you gonna be at work tomorrow?
Yeah, that's the plan.
Hello, ma'am. We were called about a disturbance?
It's more of a trespassing situation, really, but...
Yeah, that was me.
You called the cops on Dad?
I came home from work and he was back.
He had just moved back into the house.
And I asked him to leave, but he won't listen. I just...
I want him out. I want him out of the house.
Okay, Mrs. White, there's a couple questions I need to ask you.
It's very important you answer honestly.
Did he strike you?
No.
Has he ever hit you?
No. This is not about violence.
This is about trespassing.
About him being here against my will.
Okay. Trespassing.
You're divorced, then?
No, working on it.
Right now, were separated.
Legally separated?
There's not a court order, if that's what you mean.
But we've been living apart for almost two weeks, give or take.
I changed the locks. Isn't that breaking and entering?
Whose name is on the title to the house?
Both of us. It's jointly owned.
We can't arrest a man for breaking into his own house.
Not without a court order requiring he stays away.
Unless he's threatened you or the kids.
No. Not physically. But having him in the house is just...
It's not a good thing. Excuse me.
I got her, honey. Come here. Here we go.
You hungry? You hungry? Here we go.
That was it.
I'm sorry, officer. Where were we?
Disagreements.
Yes, well, we've had our share of that.
I haven't... I haven't been the most attentive husband lately.
Mrs. White, would this be easier if we stepped outside for a minute?
No. Nope. I'm fine right here.
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.
If you want him out of the house, you'll have to help me.
Is it possible maybe he's broken any laws that you know of?
Anything at all. Anything that we could work with here, just tell me.
Even if it's just a suspicion, I can work with that.
I'll get him out of the house for you.
What's your take on all this?
It's my mom's fault.
She won't even say what my dad did and it's because he didn't do anything.
I don't know why she's being this way.
My dad, he is a great guy.
Son, it's not your mom's fault.
Mrs. White.
I'm sorry, ma'am. There's no legal basis...
...for us to remove your husband from the house.
Next time you feel things are getting out of control...
...you should call this number. It's the family hotline.
I'd really look into some counseling.
Best of luck to you folks.
Listen, thank you, officers. We're sorry.
Why you gotta...? Why you gotta do this to Dad?
Junior, wait, come on. Don't blame your mother for this.
Sorry.
Welcome home.
He lives. Happy housewarming, kid.
Don't look so glad to see me.
Thanks.
Interesting decor. It's subtle.
The whole minimalist thing never really blew my hair back, but hey.
So how are you doing? Staying clean?
Good. I was kind of worried that you were back to old habits...
...since I didn't hear from you, you know.
You realize how stupid it is to ignore your counsel's phone calls?
What if I was trying to warn you...
...that the DEA was gonna kick down your door? What then?
Why don't you spare me the sermon and get to why you're here?
Fair enough. Remember the other day...
...when I brought up the idea of you getting back in touch with your partner?
Well, I kind of wanted to re-float that boat.
I'm not suggesting you yourself get back to cooking.
I mean, you being in rehab and all.
I only want you to convince the master chef to do his thing.
So, what do you say?
Sure, man. Whatever.
Okay. Whatever what?
I mean, you gonna call him?
I said I'll handle it. Now, bounce, will you? Please?
Final thought.
Look at this place. You're house-poor, you got no bankroll.
If you get the maestro cooking again, I'll make it worth your while.
Call him.
If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you:
"Do Not Call list."
However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep.
Schrader.
Yes, sir. Yeah, what's up?
Yeah?
That's great news, sir. Thank you.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, you can bet on that.
Hey, listen, thanks again, sir...
...I really appreciate you stepping to the plate. Thank you.
So you gonna keep me in suspense or what? What's the good news?
Merkert called in a couple of favors. El Paso wants me back.
Hey, man, congrats, man. That's fantastic.
Thank you.
Hello.
Gentlemen. Welcome.
Thank you for coming.
Any difficulty at the border?
The day I can't get across the border is the day I retire.
Please, come in.
I apologize that it's not wheelchair accessible.
My apologies, Gustavo.
Of course, you should have been advised.
It's your territory, you had a right to bless the order.
But...
We had no reason to believe the man was of concern to you.
Indeed, he is.
So you're in business with this Heisenberg.
I don't know him by that name, but yes.
I've made no secret of the fact that...
...I have always done business with certain local manufacturers.
You and I, we still make money together.
It's never affected our relationship.
Don Salamanca had a nephew named Tuco.
Yes, I knew of him.
Then perhaps you know Salamanca mentored him in the business.
Thought of Tuco as a son.
When Don Salamanca was no longer able, Tuco took over for his uncle.
He was a key man in our organization north of the border.
He was loyal.
This Heisenberg, Walter White...
...he was one of Tuco's local suppliers.
Until he betrayed Tuco.
So now you see, blood must be repaid by blood.
Tuco's cousins here...
...they have the right to exact vengeance.
The Salamanca family, the cartel...
...everyone stands shoulder to shoulder on this.
Don Salamanca.
Gentlemen.
I feel your loss deeply.
Please accept my condolences.
I have no issue with your right to vengeance.
But I am presently engaged in business with this man.
When our business is done...
...he will no longer be of any concern to me.
Until then...
...I need him alive.
Excuse us.
I don't tell you how to fry your chickens, Gustavo.
You should really leave matters of my organization's politics to me.
Do I not run my own territory?
Of course you do.
And I will advise them to be patient.
But I recommend you finish your business with the man quickly.
Or you risk losing the good graces of the cartel.
That would not be wise.
And those boys inside...
...I cannot guarantee that they will listen.
They are not like you and I.
If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you:
"Do Not Call list."
However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep.
If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you:
"Do Not Call list."
However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep.
If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you...
Sweetheart. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay, my girl.
Yes, it's okay. It's okay. Mama's got you.
I've got you. Yes. Yes.
Skyler? Want some help?
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?
God...
What do you mean? Against your will?
Yes.
Very much against my will. He just... He showed right back up.
And he doesn't want a divorce. Won't even consider it.
I called the police on him.
I was so clo...
So close to what?
Nothing. Never mind.
Skyler, I can't advise you properly if you don't give me all the facts.
Understand, I'm bound by the attorney-client privilege...
...to keep everything you tell me a secret.
I can't tell a soul unless you authorize me to.
Even if it's something illegal?
Especially if it's illegal.
I'm your lawyer, not the police. My job is to protect you.
My husband makes meth.
Methamphetamine.
Your husband's a drug dealer?
A manufacturer, technically.
They... They call them cooks.
I looked it up on the Internet.
This is my advice, and you should take it:
Sue your husband for divorce immediately.
Let me go to the police and tell them what you just told me.
I'll go in ex parte to get a restraining order from the court today.
If he comes anywhere near you and your children, he'll go straight to jail.
No questions asked. This is a no-brainer.
It's the best thing for you and your family.
I can't.
I can't do it.
I don't want my son to find out that his father is a criminal.
I just...
I can't do that to him.
In the end, it may not be up to you.
Drug dealers have a way of getting caught.
Walt has lung cancer.
His treatment bought him some time.
But the doctors, they all say that sooner or later...
I can't see why I should lay all this on my family...
...when things may...
...resolve themselves on their own...
...without anyone else knowing.
Man, did I lose a bet or something?
What are we doing in this shithole?
Relax, will you?
Relax? This is the kind of place you get knifed.
We should have went to Chili's, man.
All right, already. Jesus.
Outback Steakhouse. It's not too late. They got that Blooming Onion.
What's wrong with spicing things up a little?
This spice looks like it's been through a couple of guys already.
So when you headed back down to El Paso?
You know. Between all the packing, errands, getting the ducks in a row...
...maybe a week or two.
Week or two?
Come on, man. I'd be dying to get back in the action.
It's not like there's nothing going on up here.
What are you talking about?
Ain't jack going on up here. It's quiet as hell.
I'm gonna hit the head.
Those two over there. I think they're holding.
Man, in this place, the bartender's probably holding.
All right.
What you doing?
Calling A.P.D., what do you think?
Since when can't we handle a couple dirtballs?
Come on, man. Courtesy call.
What if Vice is running some kind of undercover op?
Screw it. It's your turn to pay.
Where you going?
Gotta take a leak.
Jesus, get yourself some Flomax.
Stand up.
You got a problem with us, bitch?
Your move.
DEA. Don't move.
Go out and tell my partner to get his ass in here.
If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you:
"Do Not Call list."
However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep.
If you're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you:
"Do Not Call..."
The number you have reached, 149-4985...
...in area code 505 is no longer...
Skyler.
Can we talk?
ASAC wants to see you.
And?
We were hanging back, saw a deal go down.
I went outside to call it in.
You stayed to keep an eye on the suspects.
That's when they attacked you.
What I didn't tell him is that you left your gun under the seat...
...before you went back inside.
I've done a terrible thing. But I did it for a good reason.
I did it for us.
That is college tuition for Walter Jr...
...and Holly 18 years down the road.
That is health insurance for you and the kids.
For Junior's physical therapy, his SAT tutor.
It's money for groceries...
...for gas...
...for birthdays and graduation parties.
Skyler, that money is for this roof over your head...
...the mortgage you aren't gonna be able to afford...
...on a part-time bookkeeper's salary when I'm gone.
Walt, I...
Please. Please.
This money, I didn't steal it.
It doesn't belong to anyone else.
I earned it.
The things I've done to earn it...
...the things that I've had to do...
...I've got to live with them.
Skyler...
...all that I've done...
...all the sacrifices that I have made for this family...
...all of it will be for nothing if you don't accept what I've earned.
Please.
I'll be here when you get home from work.
You can give me your answer then.
Hey, Sky.
Hey, some coffee?
Yeah.
That report's looking real good. I like how it looks.
Good.
Are your kids home?
It's here! It's here! Everybody, come on in! Look!
Hey, Mrs. White.
Hey, Louis.
Hey, thanks for having me over for dinner.
Sure.
Hey, Skyler. I'm cooking dinner.
Pot roast. Could you?
So how was your day?
Good.
Good.
Excellent.
I hope you don't mind, I invited Louis to stay for dinner tonight.
You know, as a thank-you for driving Walter Jr. To school for us.
We've been kind of absent...
...but, I tell you, Louis really pitched in.
Look, I just wanna say that I feel good about our talk this morning...
...and I'm very eager to hear what you're thinking about...
...about what we talked about.
But, you know, whenever you're ready, of course.
Honesty is good. Don't you think?
I fucked Ted.
Boys, dinner.
Iced tea?
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you.
Louis?
Yes, please.
All right.
I want you boys both to eat your salad, okay?
Okay.
I know nobody likes salad...
...but it's good for you.
Thanks, darling.
Thank you.

So cigarettes and gas is $79.70.
Crap.
There's an ATM right outside.
Yeah, I don't have a card.
Well, you can write a personal check with ID.
Kind of in between banks right now.
You think I could just come back later?
I'm totally good for it. I'd come back, I swear.
If it were me, I'd be totally, you know, "No problem."
But my dad is this ginormous hard-ass.
He was in Fallujah for a year.
And he always checks the receipts. I mean, like, always.
I gotta call him. I'm sorry.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second.
Maybe we could...
...trade.
Ever try it?
I mean, I smoke pot a lot sometimes.
I party.
But...
But that stuff's really addictive, right?
Not really.
It's just a media thing. You know?
What's it like?
It's awesome.
Everything's maximum interesting.
You get these really cold and sharp-like action dagger feelings.
It's awesome.
Come on. What do you say?
Have a nice day.
So how does it feel?
Does it hurt?
Yeah, it's tight.
Yeah, but is it painful?
It's hard to breathe.
Well, you need your breathing.
Although let's not lose sight of the fact...
...that you were the victim of a terrible accident, Antonio...
...so some discomfort is to be expected.
Let's go with that one.
A cashier's check, por favor.
Oh, and spread the word. I'm building a class-action, flight 515.
Victims' families would be great.
I'll take anyone on the ground who suffered emotionally.
Anxiety, sleeplessness. You get the picture.
Trouble?
Ted Beneke? You cannot be serious.
That guy is a joke.
You know what? You called my bluff.
What does that even mean?
You dared me to tell the police and I couldn't do it, so you win.
If you want to stay in this house, fine, but we are not married anymore.
I told you that I was done cooking meth, Skyler.
I promised you that.
So what?
You know what? At least I didn't run off to go...
Jesus! I mean, everything that I did, I did for this family.
Just keep telling yourself that.
What is that supposed to mean?
You don't like it, then leave.
And take your drug money with you.
That's what you want.
Jesus.
Garbage disposal.
You think this will get me to move out?
You can screw Ted. You can screw the butcher, the mailman.
God, Walt.
Whoever you want.
Screw them all. I'm not going anywhere.
Suit yourself.
Is this a good or bad thing?
Suit myself. You want me to suit myself?
I'll suit myself to his face!
It's a bad thing.
Hello.
Walter White to see Ted Beneke.
I'm sorry. Mr. Beneke's on a conference call.
Okay. I will wait.
It could be a while.
I have all the time in the world.
Okay.
Here we go. Okay.
Excuse me.
Mr. Beneke's not available.
Ted? Come on.
Sir, excuse me.
Excuse me.
Ted, I can see you.
I can see you standing right there in your office.
Now, come on.
Open the door. Come on, let's talk. I just want to talk. That's all.
Come on, let's be men about this. Okay? How about that?
Hey, Walt. I'm kind of in the middle of something now.
Oh, yes, you are.
So open the door.
You're damn right. You're right in the middle.
Just open the door and let's talk about it, okay?
Open the door, Ted, right now.
You don't want to be a man about it? Plan B. How do you like that? Plan B.
We have a situation.
Walt. Walt. Walt.
What are you doing?
I'm talking with Ted.
Next time, you'll open the door.
Freeze! Come on.
Oh, damn it.
No, I'm just here to talk.
I just want to talk to him.
Outside. Let's go.
God. Can I just talk? I just want to talk to him.
Calm down.
I'm just... Okay, all right.
All right, all right, all right. I'm calm. I'm calm.
Asshole.
What do you want? What do you want?
Hey! Hey, come on.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You act like you're the first guy this happened to.
I caught my second wife screwing my stepdad, okay?
It's a cruel world, Walt. Grow up.
I just wanted to talk to him.
Yeah, well, now I'm talking to you.
Consider this an intervention.
You could have been arrested back there. You understand.
Speaking as your lawyer, I'm always looking for billable hours.
But speaking as your business associate...
...I'm strongly advising that you get your shit together.
Just cool it with this Beneke guy, at least for now. Okay?
Let's talk shop, because I think this is a great opportunity...
...to channel some of that negative energy into something positive.
How did you know?
Sorry?
About Skyler. About where to find me just now.
How did you know?
That's just my meticulousness. Don't bog down in detail, Walt.
The lesson here should be...
Did you bug my house?
Yeah, but I didn't know it was your house, did I?
You'd moved out. Besides, you basically told me to.
I told you to?
You strongly hinted that I should.
You were worried your wife might say something to the police.
What? No, no, that's not true. When the hell did I say that?
Let's not get lost in the who, what and whens.
The point is we did our due diligence and she didn't talk.
She kept quiet. She stood by you, Walt...
...which, if you ask me, is the ironical silver lining here.
I mean, on the one hand...
...sure, she snuck off the reservation to get some dirty, damp and deep.
On the other hand...
Off me.
You're fired!
You're done!
Good!
"Oh, boohoo, I won't cook meth anymore."
You're a crybaby. Who needs you?
I'm unplugging the website, so no more money laundering.
How do you like that?
I want those bugs out of my house today.
I want them out now!
You just bought a $300 suit, psycho!
Go.
Great, drilled right into the stucco.
A little bit of putty, you'll be fine.
Just make sure you get all of those things.
A, these things cost $800 apiece.
B, you're not that interesting.
So yeah, I'll get all of them, Walter.
Great line of work, by the way. Real upstanding field.
Yeah, well...
...I enjoy it.
You're free to leave now. Anytime.
You know, Walter...
...sometimes it doesn't hurt to have someone watching your back.
Mr. White?
Hi.
What's up?
I can't begin to understand what you're going through, Walt...
...with all of your health concerns and the stresses you've been under.
But still, as educators...
...there are certain responsibilities we need to be meeting here...
...to the school and to the students themselves.
Of course.
Is this a wheaten terrier?
Norfolk.
Norfolk?
That's surprising.
Walt, could you come back over here and have a seat, please?
Sure.
You've been absent a lot recently.
And when you are here at school, there have been some behavioral questions.
And frankly I'm concerned.
Thank you.
Are you feeling okay?
Do you think maybe I should call Skyler?
No.
Let's just keep this...
What...?
Hey!
Walt, what's wrong with you?
You know, look, you're the one always talking about D.C., okay?
This is how you get there.
You answer the bell. You pay your dues.
Besides, you know, it's a big deal to get picked for this.
El Paso's like the Super Bowl.
I could get killed crossing the street, okay?
Whatever. You know, I want to go.
What about last time?
Schrader.
Hey, sheriff. Yeah.
Blue, huh?
Yeah, yeah. Thing is...
Thing is I'm supposed to be getting on a plane right now.
The stuff this guy had was blue. You sure about that?
Yeah.
Yeah, I want to talk to him.
Taxi.
Hi.
Man, I'm sorry.
I needed to talk to you, but you weren't at your apartment.
No, I moved back home.
That's good, right?
Yeah.
Yo, did you just get fired?
No.
No, no, no.
It's more like a sabbatical.
Indefinite. Yeah.
So, what's up?
Should we go somewhere?
No, this is fine.
So I want an intro to your guy.
What guy?
Your guy. Your distribution guy. The guy Saul hooked you up with.
No, no, no. Come on, Jesse.
I thought about it and I want to.
God.
It's the one thing I'm good at.
No, that is just not true.
You're good at a lot of things, son.
Like what?
What about your sobriety?
I told you, I'm not using.
Ever.
I just want back into the business.
Well, I don't. I'm sorry.
I know, and that's cool.
I'm not asking you to cook.
What's this?
In the end, I just went with two reflux condensers.
I didn't want to lose track of my pH levels.
But I did everything else just like you taught me.
Super careful in my amounts...
...and watched the numbers every step of the way.
So, what do you think? It's good, right?
What in the hell is this?
What?
What?
This. This. This is my product.
This is my formula. This is mine.
It's our product, but yeah, I was gonna cut you in.
Oh, you were gonna cut me in?
No, no, no. I cut you in.
What the hell is your problem? All I'm asking is for you to set a meet.
Absolutely not.
Why?
Because I am not gonna lend my name to an inferior product.
I mean, look at the diameters here.
What did you use for reduction?
Don't tell me. Platinum dioxide, right?
No. Mercury-aluminum amalgam.
The dioxide's too hard to keep wet.
All right, well, you must've done it wrong, then.
Your color is all cloudy, so you were struggling with distillation too.
Now, this is very shoddy work, Pinkman.
I'm actually embarrassed for you.
What?
No way. I gave out samples and everyone said it was the bomb.
Oh, they said it was the bomb.
And who were they, I wonder? A bunch of meth heads?
Yeah.
Yeah.
They should know, right?
Yeah, well, sorry.
I can't help you.
Fine, ass-wad.
I'll contact the guy myself.
Oh, yeah? Well, good luck.
Because my guy is a pro and he doesn't deal with junkies.
You know what? Eat me.
Anytime, loser.
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait. Hey!
I can't believe it's only 4:00.
This day is dragging.
Okay.
I wish I could stay.
So stay.
What's stopping you?
What, like everything, you mean?
How about my lunatic husband refusing to leave the house?
So move in here.
And then my son hating me even more.
That'll pass. I went through that with the girls.
They adapt.
And now everyone at work thinks I'm an evil ladder-climbing whore.
They're all fired, effective immediately.
What else?
Oh, aren't you the answer man?
Where did it...?
Where did it go wrong, exactly, with you and Walt?
I mean, I always saw him as kind of...
...mild-mannered.
Something, I don't know, change when he got sick or?
I don't know what changed, Ted.
And I just don't feel really comfortable talking about it.
Sorry.
Just asking out of self-interest.
Gotta make sure I don't make the same mistake.
I would be amazed.
Just let me see if I'm following you here, Russell.
You got this stuff from some guy at Gasparza's...
...who was wearing tan pants...
...and who you're 80 percent sure had a mustache.
That's it, right?
That's your brain working at maximum capacity?
Russell.
Everything all right in there?
Mel. The dude's name was Mel.
Well, there you go. See? You served an actual earthly function.
I can't believe I remembered that.
Mel who? Does he have a last name?
Yeah, Mel.
Wait.
Was it Mel...
...or Mark?
It was definitely an M name.
Oh, man, I'm losing it.
Wait, wait.
Yeah.
It's gone.
It was an M name though.
Yeah.
I remember the... sound.
All right, well, we'll go with the... sound.
Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
Yeah.
He definitely had tan pants.
Remind me to get a vasectomy.
Okay, it's after 9, so this bar that Girl George is at...
...probably wall-to-wall dirtbags by now.
Let's go have a little looky-loo, see if we can't find this M-named clown.
What? It's a lead.
Lead to what?
To Heisenberg.
I told you it was only a matter of time before this guy booted up again.
Here we go, my friend.
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful, Gomey.
Just apologize and buy me a beer.
Man, you're reaching.
This stuff could be a knockoff or left over from an older cook.
How do you know Heisenberg's gearing up again?
How do I know?
Because I know.
I don't get it.
This is the reason why you're blowing off the task force?
Chase down teeners?
I'm getting tired of all the second-guessing.
If you're not sufficiently stimulated by this investigation...
...do us both a favor and ask for a transfer.
What is up with you lately?
Starting bar fights, turning down El Paso...
...and now this bullshit?
Do you need to talk to someone or what?
Talk to someone?
Talk to who?
I'm not trying to step on your toes, bro. Okay?
I'm just worried about you. That's all.
Appreciate that, bro.
Now take your hand off my shoulder.
Yeah, yeah, the one that was on TV.
Did any little piece fall on your property?
I'm not looking for an entire wing here, Mr. Linkas.
It could be a nut or a bolt. It could be a bag of peanuts...
...just so long as it caused you pain and suffering.
Oh, no, no, no. Closed. Calling you back.
You had your chance. I told you to get him cooking again.
You blew it off and now it's too late. The guy's gone mass maniac on us!
All I wanted was to show you two your potential.
And what do I get in return? A bone contusion.
You wanna see the scar? I wish you two had...
Hi, there.
How in the hell did you get Walt to...?
I made it.
You know the guy who knows the guy, right?
Well, good news is...
...for a stage-three cancer, the guy's doing well physically.
Mentally, the guy's a disaster.
He's gone off the rails over this thing with his wife.
My opinion, he's not coming back. Not on his own.
Your friends were at his place again, by the way.
They drew something on the street outside his house.
The scythe.
Animals.
Does the lawyer know?
Should he?
No.
If you want this guy to produce again, why not just tell him?
You stand between him and an ax in the head.
I don't believe fear to be an effective motivator.
I want investment.
For now, I'm simply interested in time frame.
He will live for the foreseeable future, yes?
Foreseeable. Couple years at least, barring acts of God and men with axes.
From the lawyer, I'm supposed to let you know...
...the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.
I don't work with junkies.
That's what I thought you'd say.
Probably for the best.
What I hear, he and Walter are splitsville.
Really?
That's what Goodman says. Cats and dogs.
Do the deal.
You have one unheard message.
Agent Schrader, you need to be calling me back ASAP.
I've got Texas breathing down my neck and I'm not about...
No, I haven't seen Matt since my dad fired him, like, a while ago.
Where can I find him, you think?
No idea. Haven't seen him.
I know. You said that a few times.
Yeah, because I haven't seen him. I don't know what else to say.
What's your name, darling?
Cara.
Where did this come from, Cara?
I don't know.
What is it? Drugs?
Look, I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
You're a bad liar, Cara.
Don't get me wrong. Not the worst I've ever seen.
Once had a guy try to explain the dope balloon up his butt on bad Thai food.
Still, you're not a very good liar.
I honestly don't know...
Stop.
You look like a good kid. I'm not here to get you in trouble.
But you need to tell me where this came from right now!
I never do stuff like this. I swear to God.
I tried it and I hated it, so I just gave it to Matt.
Okay, and who gave it to you?
Some guy.
He came in a couple days ago and wanted to trade it for gas.
Some guy? What's his name?
Okay, what...? What did he look like?
I don't know.
He looked pretty normal.
You know, white.
I think his hair was lightish brown.
He had really blue eyes.
They were really, really blue.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, dreamy. Okay, what else?
Piercings, jewelry, distinctive articles of clothing. Come on.
Come on.
Listen to me.
It's real important that I find the person that had these drugs.
So if you can remember anything else...
Come on, think. Come on, now. Come on.
He drove an RV.
Okay, good, good.
What can you remember? What kind of RV?
What color? Did you spot a license plate?
I don't know the kinds and I didn't see the license.
But the color was, I think, white, brownish color.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm not helping you...
...but, please, don't tell my dad.
Cara.
Please, tell me that that camera works.
Damn it.
Bingo.
These eggs are good, Mom.
Thanks.
Hey, you know what's weird? Dad's website.
It's been three days since the last donation.
Yeah, well, people lose interest.
So how long are you off for?
A few weeks.
I'll play it by ear.
I probably pushed it, you know, going back to work too soon.
Think I can get a ride today? Louis has a doctor's appointment.
Yeah.
Hey, so, Dad can babysit now, right?
You won't have to take Holly to work every day.
Sometime, maybe.
Yeah, we'll see.
What's up?
I think you'll seriously enjoy, yo.
Wait. No, no. No way.
Hey! Hey!
Hey. What the hell? This is only half.
That's right. It's your half.
Yo, where's the other half, bitch?
I mean, the whole thing was crazy. Poor bastard. I felt sorry for him.
I think he actually thought we were the cable guys, you know.
Anyway, sorry about those missed calls, chief.
I'm changing providers. It won't happen again.
Are you going to El Paso, Hank?
Hell, yes. With pointy boots and bells on.
Got this break in the Heisenberg case.
The blue meth, you mean? The teenth?
Yeah, well, that teenth got things rolling.
I traced it to a gas station in Cibola. That's where I got these.
The station's closed-circuit was down... Surprise, surprise.
But I was able to pull some of these snapshots off an ATM security camera.
We always thought these guys might be camper-cooking.
First off, your typical Class C motor home...
...is gonna grunt at least 5000 pounds of interior fixtures.
Appliances, furniture, built-ins, 5000 pounds at least, okay?
See how high that suspension's riding?
No way, no how, this thing's carrying that kind of weight.
This thing has been cleared out and stripped down to its tight-and-curlies.
For what? Blood bank?
Maybe a bookmobile?
There's no clear view of the plates.
Yeah, well, you can only get so lucky, right?
But there's no front plate. Tells me it's likely New Mexico registration.
I check with DMV.
There are only 29 of these early-'80s Bounders registered in the state.
Only 29?
Yeah.
So I gotta go, you know, knock on some doors.
They need you in El Paso, Hank.
You bet. I'm just gonna wrap up this Heisenberg thing first.
You're refusing the assignment.
I'm not. I'll go.
It's just I need some more time.
You're not hearing me, Agent Schrader.
You're out of time.
Are you going to El Paso now, tonight?
It's a simple yes or no.
No. I can't.
But that's only because I'm really close to something big here.
Better get to it, then.
This is KECA 480, Albuquerque's news radio.
KECA news time, 10:13.
Our top story this hour, Donald Margolis...
...the air-traffic controller criticized for his role in the recent air disaster...
...in which 167 persons died...
...was rushed to an area hospital early this morning...
...apparently the victim of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Police won't say whether or not...
Your half.
Okay, okay.
ï»¿1
I am awake.
You are not how I remember you from class. I mean, like, not at all.
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand, all right? My guy wants 85.
This is all the money I have in the world.
You are a drug dealer. Negotiate.
Buy the RV.
We start tomorrow.
Work it, work it, baby. Yo, this is sick, brother.
Totally. God.
Yo, Jesse, I got these two fine ladies who wanna participate.
You got the funds?
Oh, I got the funds. Hey.
Would you ladies like to meet my fat stack?
Get in here.
Come on.
Hey, yo, yo.
Yo, you got champagne? None of that cheap stuff.
I want the expensive shit. Don PÃ©rignon.
It's 400 a bottle.
Oh, well, in that case, I'll only have two.
Oh, and I want the tall, skinny glasses. I like those skinny glasses.
That's what James Bond drinks. Mofos, I'm all about that.
Yo, Jesse, man, I gotta ask.
Where did you get all the cheddar?
Must be moving mad volume.
It's funny. You wanna know what's funny?
What's funny?
This old dude, he gave it to me.
What?
He gave it to me.
It's his entire life savings.
What? Why?
Because he's a dumb-ass. That's why.
Oh, God.
Yes!
All right, living large, players.
Thank you. Yo, thank you.
Thank you.
That was...
Awesome, bro.
Later.
Oh, man.
Oh, I'm so dead.
I only got... Oh, damn.
I only got, like, 1400.
Waffle House? Yeah.
No, man.
Supposed to use that dude's money to buy an RV.
What do you want with a RV for?
Because, like...
Because, like...
Never mind.
Jesus.
Now I gotta, like, leave town or change my identity or something.
Guy's blackmailing me.
He's got, like, a criminal mind, yo.
RV, yeah?
I can hook you up, bro. I can totally get you an RV.
No, I need it today. Now.
No problem. Let's go.
You're telling me you can get me an RV?
For 1400, at 6 in the morning?
Right on.
So do I need to sign something?
No, it's, like, a no-paperwork-type deal.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Come on, we gotta bounce.
What?
For real, yo. Get it out of here.
Oh, my God, I love this floor.
This feels fantastic.
Can you control the temperature?
Yeah. There should be a switch right next to you there.
It's a thermostat.
Ted, this has gotta be...
...the most amazing invention ever.
I know. Contractor talked me into it.
Seemed kind of extravagant, but...
I gotta tell you, once you try it, you can't go back.
I can never find anything in this Buick.
You know, you could leave a few things here if you want.
Why don't you go get your dad?
Sure.
Hey, Dad.
Dad?
Yeah.
Mom's asking.
Wanna come to dinner?
Yeah, I'll be right there.
You're not listening to me. I don't know.
Yeah, right, like you don't know.
What did I just say?
Give me the phone. Give it.
Like you didn't make some deal behind my back.
Correct. I did not.
I was sitting at a stoplight...
...minding my own business, when the man... The man...
The kid threw a bag of money through my window.
Whatever, man. You owe me that money.
Let me talk to him.
I owe you?
I owe you nothing.
And I will get to the bottom of this. Trust me.
Trust you? Trust you? That's a good one.
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
You wanna talk about trust, Jesse? Let's talk about trust.
I told you not to cook my formula, and you went ahead and did it anyway.
Because I never said I wouldn't cook it because it ain't yours. It's ours.
Plural, bitch.
You did not have my permission.
All I know is I got half the money I'm due...
...and you got the rest.
Escalating. You're escalating.
You know what? Escalate this. My meth, my money!
I will be a one-man glass factory. I will rock that RV 24...
It's buttoned up tight. Can't see a damn thing.
I ain't feeling it.
No smoke, no smell, no waste. There's no cook.
Could be they're setting up. I heard movement inside.
I say we call it a night, come back with a search warrant.
I'm not letting this sucker out of my sight.
There's gotta be a way.
There's gotta be a way. There's gotta be a way...
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?
No, no, no.
What the hell are you doing up there?
Are you some kind of a pervert?
Yeah, because we were here last year.
Sorry. I appreciate...
Going after the bad guys.
I'm sorry and enjoy the rest of your vacation. Okay?
Go back to your trailers. Everything's okay.
Guy's VFW. He's cool.
We're gonna check out a couple more and call it a morning.
Okay, what do you say?
Can't. Gotta get home.
Why, you leave your balls in your wife's purse or what?
Gotta pack.
Where you headed?
Texas.
Hey there.
Hank?
Can I come in?
Hey, babe.
Hey.
How did it go last night?
Good.
Catch the bad guys?
Nope.
Want me to make you breakfast?
No. I'm...
I'm heading back out after this.
Now? You worked all night.
Get some sleep, Hank. Those RVs aren't going anywhere.
They're recreational vehicles, Marie. That's what they do.
You know what I mean.
I spoke with Blanca.
She said that Steven's going to El Paso?
Yeah.
I was just wondering how you feel about that.
I turned it down. End of story.
Good. Good.
Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.
I needed some time here because I'm deep into this investigation...
...and couldn't do both...
...so I made a judgment call.
You know that you can talk to me about things, right?
You don't have to go through this alone.
Do you ask me which lead bib to put on someone...
...before you nuke them?
Jesus, Marie.
I made a decision. I'm not going through anything.
Doing my job.
I would like...
I know. I know.
A condo in Georgetown. I know.
If you would let me finish, I was going to say...
...I'd like to be included. That's all.
Don't you worry about my career. My career is just fine.
Did you not wanna go?
I don't blame you. I just...
Aren't you late for work or something?
After what happened...
...it would make perfect sense for you to not wanna go back.
I'm onto some important stuff right here, right now.
Mexico doesn't have a damn thing to do with it. Anyone who doubts that...
I mean, I'm doing some actual good out here...
...and all I get are these bullshit accusations!
What, everyone thinks I'm jerking off on this thing? Fine.
But I'm onto something. I know it.
You understand me?
You hear me?
What exactly is this?
I'll tell you what I think it is.
A ploy. A ploy to get me cooking again.
And an obvious one at that.
How do you mean?
As if I would seriously believe you would hire an addict.
Jesse Pinkman? Recovering or not.
You vouched for him previously. I took you at your word.
No. No, no, no. Let me be clear. Let me be perfectly clear.
Jesse was capable of working under my supervision.
Trusting him with a solo venture...
...well, that's quite another matter.
How he could possibly produce anything...
...other than a mediocre product at best.
I am told his product was more or less consistent...
...with the quality I had come to expect.
More or less?
More or less? Really?
Boy, that is the... Talk about setting the bar low.
Except you don't do that, set the bar low.
Therefore, what conclusion am I left to draw?
That you believe I have some proprietary kind of selfishness...
...about my own formula.
Some sort of overweening pride, I suppose...
...that you think simply overwhelms me...
...clouds my judgment.
But it doesn't.
Absolutely not.
I simply respect the chemistry.
The chemistry must be respected.
I apologize for being so transparent.
Would you take a drive with me? I'd like to show you something.
Hi. Is everything okay?
She's already finished an entire bottle, but she still seemed hungry.
Then she fell asleep.
But I was thinking I'd give her another when she wakes up.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
Fatten that baby up.
Will do.
Was that it?
So where are you? Are you at work?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm at work. I shouldn't be much longer.
Is that okay?
You know I love my little pookums.
You can leave her with me for the next 18 years...
...as far as I'm concerned.
Great. Thanks, Marie.
Are you sure you're okay?
Sweetie, what is it? Come on.
It's Hank.
Hank? What about him?
I don't know how to talk to him.
I don't know what to say to him anymore. I don't know how to...
Ever since El Paso, ever since... Maybe before...
Yeah. God knows he went through a lot down there.
People blown up right in front of him, blood everywhere...
...and last week, El Paso said they want him back.
Yeah?
He's not going. Steve Gomez is going in his place...
...and I don't know how I feel about that.
Well, he's certainly a lot safer up here, isn't he?
Of course, and I want him safe.
But I can't tell what he wants. He won't talk to me.
He hardly even comes home. He works all day, all night.
Barely eats, barely speaks to me.
It's like something's eating him away from inside.
He's just not the same. He's not.
Facing death, it changes a person. It has to, don't you think?
I guess you've noticed a change in Walt.
Please.
What is this?
Your new lab.
My God.
Thorium oxide for a catalyst bed.
Look at the size of this reaction vessel.
Oh, it's got... It's gotta be 1200 liters.
Where...? Where...?
How did you know how to put this all together?
I had excellent help, as will you.
Quite a lot of planning went into this.
I would say so.
The laundry upstairs, I've owned it for years.
It receives large chemical deliveries on a weekly basis...
...detergents and such.
There is nothing suspicious about it...
...and my employees, to be sure, are well-trained, trustworthy.
The filtration system is state-of-the-art.
It will vent nothing but clean, odorless steam...
...just as the laundry does...
...and through the very same stacks.
I need 200 pounds per week to make this economically viable.
You would choose your own hours, of course...
...come and go as you please...
...so long as the quota is met.
Sorry.
The answer is still no.
I have made a series of very bad decisions...
...and I cannot make another one.
Why did you make these decisions?
For the good of my family.
Then they weren't bad decisions.
What does a man do, Walter?
A man provides for his family.
This cost me my family.
When you have children, you always have family.
They will always be your priority, your responsibility.
And a man... A man provides.
And he does it even when he's not appreciated...
...or respected...
...or even loved.
He simply bears up, and he does it...
...because he's a man.
Any chance we could grab a quick bite?
Thai place around the corner's pretty good.
I really gotta head home.
All right, rain check, then.
She said it was the tofu.
Whatever. She's still cute anyways.
Great dinner, Mom.
Can I be excused?
To do homework or to play video games?
I can multitask.
Yeah.
You wanna take her?
Yeah.
Give me something, Andy. Come on.
Welded onto the back of a house. Well, that's classy.
Christ.
Okay. Okay, thanks.
Hey, Janice. Janice.
That the last one?
Sorry, Hank. That's all DMV had.
Twenty-nine early '80s Bounders registered in New Mexico.
Could you check again?
Now?
Can I do it after the party?
Janice, I'm...
I'm dead in the water here.
Okay, I'll check.
Hey, how are you guys doing?
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna clean it really good, I tell you.
All good.
Gomey.
Yeah.
Time for the little bird to fly the nest, huh?
The right guy for the job, seeing as the bean-speak comes natural and all.
Wanna know how to say "get bent" in Spanish?
Just don't go native on me, all right?
Hey.
Here.
Know your enemy and all.
Fight the good fight, brother.
I will.
Who got a drink around here?
Your hunch was right. One more RV.
DMV said the registration wasn't renewed...
...but then they realized it was never filed as non-operational or destroyed.
No police report, either.
I just don't know what the hell I'm doing anymore, you know?
It's like I'm paralyzed...
...like if I take a step in any direction...
...I'm gonna make a spectacular mistake.
God, I could go for a glass of wine about now.
You wanna go to...?
Sorry, never mind.
Anyway...
...breaking news is I am sleeping with my boss...
...and I don't know why.
Yep.
That's a lie. I do know why.
I mean, he's a lovely guy.
He's a really good person...
...but, I mean, it's not like we're ever gonna...
Somehow, and I can't actually believe it...
...but my entire family sees me as some sort of...
My own sister, my brother-in-law.
My teenage son...
...tells me I'm a bitch.
And you say tell him the truth.
Tell him about his father...
...but I can't.
Ever.
How could I?
And this man that I'm seeing, you know...
...as wrong as I know it is...
...as much as I know I'm probably doing it to make Walt leave me...
...it is the only thing in my day where I don't feel...
...like I'm...
...drowning.
So he knows about this other man?
Yeah.
So then he'll sign?
Walt says he's not going anywhere...
...so that's a really brilliant gambit on my part. Yep.
Genius.
He keeps money in the house.
Your husband, the drug dealer?
How much money?
I didn't count it. It's heavy.
A bag, where he keeps it.
Are you asking my permission to spend this money?
No. God, no. I just...
No, I'm just, you know...
I'm just trying to just talk it through. That's...
Let me just say that I'm half as qualified...
...and twice the price of a therapist. There is nothing to discuss here.
I'm just saying, you know? We have a history.
He's the father of my children...
...and maybe what he did, he...
He did it for the family. Right?
Well, guess what.
That is one enormous load of horse shit.
Okay.
I'm going to spell this out as simply as I can for you.
You are a fool to stay in that house one minute longer.
If your husband won't leave, then you go.
You are now an accessory after the fact.
You are culpable.
You, your children, you could lose everything you own.
Do you understand?
All courtesy of this criminal you refuse to divorce.
I didn't marry a criminal.
Well, you're married to one now.
How about we run through this one more time...
...especially where I do the talking, you don't say jack?
Oh, I'm gonna say jack. I'm gonna say plenty.
What did we say about escalating, huh? Who's got your back here?
Me, all right? I'm going to take care of things.
Hey, what are the parameters of this sobriety thing you got going?
What do you mean?
Can you take a Xanax?
Because I got a drawer full of them.
I get them from my "chiropractor."
Vietnamese, 5-foot tall. She adjusts you to "completion."
Her name's Kim Nu Suong...
...as delicious as it sounds.
I should give you her card.
Hell with this. I'm out of here.
He's here.
Send him in.
Hello, Walt. Good to see you.
Please, have a seat here.
Mr. Pinkman, if you will.
You're late.
Gentlemen, if we could come to some accommodation here now.
There's always a way to oil everyone's lock.
This young man is prepared to offer you a sweetheart of a deal...
...for doing precisely nothing.
Really?
Ten percent of all future profits from his solo venture.
That's money you get paid for walking down to the mailbox.
Consider it a gesture of respect for your valuable contribution...
...to the business thus far. I'm sure you'll agree that's fair.
That's charity, is what that is.
I do all the work.
He sits around on his fat ass judging people.
Escalating. Stop.
So there's that, but then there's one small detail.
Clearly a mistake was made on the part of our mutual associate...
...when he paid you half of Jesse's earnings.
He must not have realized that you two had come to a parting of the ways.
Take it. It belongs to you.
You're damn right it belongs to me.
I knew I could count on you boys to play nice. That's...
That almost brings a tear to my eye.
Enjoy it.
Spend it in good health.
That is the last money you'll ever earn in this business.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesse, but our mutual associate...
...was only using you to get to me.
What are you talking about?
See, he needs someone with expertise...
...someone who knows what he's doing.
In other words, he needs me.
You're telling me you're cooking again?
Yeah. Let's see, how should I put this?
I'm in.
You're out.
Walt, hold on there.
What was the offer, if I may ask?
It's 3 million for three months of my time.
You're gonna need that money laundered. I mean, of course.
What was our deal before?
Seventeen percent. That's a shade high.
Let's settle on an even 15. That's a nice round number.
Five percent.
Fourteen's fair.
Five.
Thirteen.
Five.
Twelve. For old times' sake, 12.
Five.
I'm a reasonable guy. It's a short-term deal.
Ten even, but I can't go any lower and still respect myself.
Five.
What in the hell just happened? You're my lawyer, not his.
That's the way of the world, kid. Go with the winner.
You think this will stop me from cooking?
Cook whatever you like.
As long as it's that ridiculous Chili P or some other dreck...
...but don't even think about using my formula.
Just try and stop me, bitch.
Yes?
Hi there, Mrs. Ortega?
Yes.
Hi, I'm Hank Schrader.
I'm with the Drug Enforcement Administration.
We're interested in an RV that's registered to your name and address.
Do you have an RV?
I did.
It was stolen months ago.
Stolen, huh? Yeah.
Well, then I'm curious as to why the theft was never reported.
I'm not seeing any records of it with the police or the DMV.
I just didn't get around to it.
May I ask why?
I mean, it's a great way to get the family together...
...for an affordable vacation.
It must've been a blow when it went missing.
It was.
Do you have any ideas at all who might've taken it?
I didn't want him arrested.
He ran with a bad crowd, but he was never a bad person.
I thought he could turn his life around.
Who are we talking about, Mrs. Ortega?
My son.
I'd really like to speak with him.
He's passed away. He was shot two months ago.
What was your son's name?
Christian.
Christian Ortega.
Was his nickname Combo?
Thanks for this. I really appreciate it.
ï»¿1
KDK-12, come in.
KDK-12.
KDK-12.
Hey, Bobby, need you to look in on Mrs. Peyketewa.
She all right?
Her daughter called from California.
She hasn't heard from her in a while, kind of worried.
Will do.
Miss Peyketewa, hello.
Miss Peyketewa.
KDK-12 here. Janet, Jesus, we got a homicide.
Come again?
Miss Peyketewa, she's dead.
I need some backup out here.
Okay. On their way.
Whoever's in there, show yourself right now!
Hold it right there.
Let me see your hands.
Hands!
All right, down.
On your knees.
You understand me?
Do you speak English?
I said, down. On your knees.
Down!
Damn it, get down.
On your knees.
Do it.
On your knees or I'll fire!
Yeah?
I found the papers.
Right where you left them, in the crib.
Yeah, well...
You know best, right?
Anything else?
Do you have any thought...
...about how we're going to approach this with Walter Jr?
Well, he's still my son.
I mean, he will remain...
Of course.
My point being...
...the divorce.
Well, I...
I think he gets it, don't you?
I mean, I...
I think he saw it coming.
He sees your unhappiness and...
My unhappiness?
My completely out-of-the-clear...
...blue-sky unhappiness?
Really?
Look, as you said, for the best.
Yeah.
Okay.
Last thing and then I'll let you go.
In the child support worksheet, you list medical, dental...
...child care, transportation, housing, education, food, clothing.
That's right, all of it.
Walt.
No.
Skyler, you wanted me out...
...I'm out, but I will provide for my family.
Not with that money.
You'd be making us accessories after the fact.
How do you think we've been paying our bills these last six months?
I have to go.
Yep, I was right.
Three units available, exact same floor plan.
I can call over, get you in to see any of the others.
No, no, this one's fine.
I'll take it.
Now, unfortunately, this one is the model, so...
Yeah, I like it.
I like everything about it.
I'll take it as-is.
Name one thing in this world that is not negotiable.
You have to clean the fryer.
Yes, sir.
We try to clean them every night...
...but make sure it's off before you open the intake valve.
Good. Now, I suggest that you add this to your Monday maintenance schedule.
Yes, sir. Now, select freezing mode...
...clock button off, press and hold auto-control until it beeps.
Main valve on, main switch on.
Give the compressor time for the needle to enter the green.
You're for real?
This is all you?
All me.
Heisenberg who? That's what I say.
My man Jesse can cook.
Check it, yo. It ain't cloudy or dirty or nothing.
Just the right shade of blue.
Good shade.
Check out that crystal size. If that bitch was any bigger...
...it would be a Jolly Rancher.
Be my guest.
You sure?
I feel kind of dickish with you being in rehab and all.
No. I can watch, yo.
I can cook and I can watch.
Go for it.
I tried it last week. I'm still coming down.
Go easy.
Okay.
Riverdance.
Hey, hey, stop marking up my floor, dumb-ass. Come on.
Bow before me.
I am Lord of the Dance.
Shit.
I gotta try that again.
Yeah, no, I think you're good.
That is awesome, Jesse.
I feel like somebody took my brain out and boiled it in, like, boiling hot...
It's the bomb, man, seriously.
Like anthrax.
Good.
So...
...you ready to talk some business?
You mean this is not, like, just recreational?
I know...
...what you're thinking.
Trust me, it's not gonna be like it was.
All right, never gonna be like it was.
How's that?
We sell it safe.
All right? We sell it smart.
We don't get greedy, like before.
I don't know, man.
Combo and all.
Still...
...man's gotta make his living.
If it's like Jesse says and we're not greedy...
I mean...
...I guess I can see it.
Had a good thing going before we started pushing our luck.
If it can go back to being like that...
Hey, it will be.
Step one, we build inventory.
Badger, go see Clovis.
Get the RV in shape, tune-up, oil change, brake lights, and whatnot.
Cops always pull you over for brake lights. Not us.
Cautious.
Right on.
You got it.
You know that buzzer thing? Leave the key in the ignition, it buzzes?
Just have him put in one of those too.
Skinny, you're in charge of supplies.
I'll get you a list.
Right on.
Yeah?
Yeah.
All right.
So...
...we good?
Yeah.
Good?
All right.
Let's do this thing.
Brandon Mayhew.
I know you.
Small world, Albuquerque.
Wanna talk about it?
Why? It's not like I get a vote.
You know, ironically...
...I think you're gonna see much more of me from now on.
Sure.
Well, just as much of me at least.
I'm taking you to the school, to and from, every day.
What, I don't get a vote in this either?
I gotta stop going with Louis just because you're feeling guilty?
I do feel guilty.
I am the man that I am, son...
...and there's plenty that I would change about that, but...
Here we are, and this is just what it is.
You know what? Call me crazy...
...but I'm actually feeling very good about the future.
Morning.
They're back.
I'm wondering if we should maybe call the police or something.
Why?
They're doing nothing wrong.
Okay, let's put this on Table 33, okay?
Hello there.
Mr. White, I presume?
Oh, yes. Hi.
I...
Sorry. I'll be right down.
Hi. Gale Boetticher.
Hi.
You're my new lab assistant, I take it.
Yes, I am.
I suppose you'll wanna hear my qualifications.
I have my rÃ©sumÃ© here for you.
I received my bachelor's degree from UNM.
My master's from the University of Colorado.
Organic chemistry with a specialty in...
It's all right there.
"X-ray crystallography."
Really?
I could talk about that for hours.
I would love to.
But first, I'm curious about this.
That's a little pet project of mine.
See, in my opinion, it's all about the quinic acid level.
You want just north of 4800 milligrams per liter...
...but if you over-boil to get there, you'll leach your tannins.
Bitterness, yuck.
So I pull a mild vacuum.
That way, I can keep the temperature no higher than 92 C and...
Judge for yourself.
Oh, my God.
My God, that is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
Sumatran beans...
...and I also have to give credit to the grind...
...but thank you, Mr. White.
Walt.
Please, call me Walt.
Why the hell are we making meth?
Hey.
Tell me...
...with the phenylacetic acid solution...
...you said 150 drops per minute for the first 10 minutes...
...and then 90 for the remainder. Why is that?
Well, my thinking is, by tapering the phenyl...
...you get an oilier aqueous layer, and hence...
Better benzene extraction.
Exactly.
But actually, I prefer ether.
Oh, I'll have it for tomorrow.
Gale, I'm wondering how you...
Ended up here.
Well, actually, I'm still wondering how I ended up here, but, yes.
I mean, I can't imagine we strike each other as criminals.
Well, there's crime and then there's crime...
...I suppose.
I'm definitely a libertarian.
Consenting adults want what they want...
...and if I'm not supplying it, they will get it somewhere else.
With me, they're getting exactly what they pay for.
No added toxins or adulterants.
Yeah, I was doing it the way you are supposed to...
...pursuing my doctorate at Colorado, NSF research grant.
I was on my way, jumping through hoops...
...kissing the proper behinds...
...attending to all the non-chemistry that one finds oneself occupied by.
You know that world.
That is not what I signed on for.
I love the lab.
Because it's all still magic.
You know?
Chemistry?
I mean...
...once you lose that...
It is.
It is magic.
It still is.
And all the while, I kept thinking about that great old Whitman poem:
"When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer."
I don't know it.
Anyway...
Well, can you recite it?
Pathetically enough, I could.
All right, well...
No, no, come on. Come on.
Yeah?
When I heard the learn'd astronomer
When the proofs, the figures Were ranged in columns before me
When I was shown the charts And the diagrams
To add, divide, and measure them
When I, sitting, Heard the astronomer
Where he lectured with much applause In the lecture-room
How soon, unaccountable I became tired and sick
Till rising and gliding out
I wander'd off by myself
In the mystical moist night-air
And from time to time
Look'd up in perfect silence At the stars
Yes.
I am a nerd.
Bravo.
Thank you.
Come on, Pinkman.
You little rat bastard.
Get off your lazy ass and go break the law.
Hey, baby.
Are you ever coming home?
Marie, I'm working.
Did you find it? The RV?
No. Working on it, so...
Why can't you just arrest him, make him tell you?
It's not simple. There's a thing called the Constitution.
Constitution, blah, blah, blah.
This kid, I swear to God, I wish I just could...
This is that Pinkman character?
That's the one.
Positive the little bastard's got an RV.
I just don't know where he keeps it.
Until he actually leads me to it or does something...
...I'm stuck here, Marie, so sorry.
Well, not to bring up ancient history...
...but I, for one, can think of someone who might know something.
Possibly.
It's worth a shot.
Yeah?
Who?
Hello.
Oh, hey, buddy.
Hey, how you doing?
Oh, hey, Hank. What's up?
Listen, I hate to bother you.
I just had a quick question.
Shoot.
I only ask this because I'm at a, you know, dead end here, potentially.
I'm working a case and...
You know that I would never put you on the spot or make you uncomfortable.
Hank, you could just cut to the chase.
Back when we lost you and I was trying to track you down...
...through your student, Jesse Pinkman.
Now, you know that I know that once upon a time...
...he may have dealt you a little weed.
Hank...
Just a little.
And I so do not care about that.
As far as I'm concerned, you never inhaled.
Like you said, cut to the chase.
Do you remember if this Pinkman kid ever had an RV?
You know, a recreational vehicle...
...you know, like a Winnebago-type deal, brown and beige?
Why?
Long story, but I'm personally of the opinion he's moved on from weed...
...and graduated to selling crystal meth, using it as a rolling lab.
Walt?
Yo.
What, Mr. White?
How's my favorite genius?
Is this a secure line?
Is this a secure...? Yes, what's with the...?
Hey, hello to you too.
Listen, we've got a problem, a DEA problem.
I'm listening.
My brother-in-law...
...he knows about the RV.
What RV?
Our RV...
...the one which contains a meth lab, which is covered with my fingerprints.
What does "knows about" mean? Does he have it? Has he searched it?
No, he knows it exists and he's trying to find it.
He has linked it to Jesse. It's a matter of time before he tracks it down.
So get rid of it! What are you doing sitting there?
Better yet, have Pinkman get rid of it. Right? You don't go near it.
My brother-in-law, he is surveilling Jesse's house.
So he might have tapped the phones or bugged his house.
Jesus. Plan A, then. Go. Get to it before the feds do.
And do what exactly?
I mean, what...?
The thing is the size of a...
It's RV-size.
I mean, where do I go to make an RV disappear?
I'm not David Copperfield.
What do I look like, the RV disposal people?
Did you not plan for this contingency?
No.
Well, next time, plan for it, would you?
The Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button.
Okay. Shut up.
I'm just saying, you're good with tools and all.
Why don't you invent a water-powered car, you know?
You did that, you would be rolling in it.
Socket wrench.
The big one.
What? You scared of the Arabs?
You out of your minds? Why is this in the open?
Who the hell are you?
He's Heisenberg.
Is this drivable?
Yeah. I was changing the oil.
Finish it. We'll wipe it clean, take it out to the desert.
Come on, help me.
Hold up. What's this about?
The DEA, the Drug Enforcement Administration.
You've heard of them, right? I know you have.
They know all about this RV and they're trying to find it right now.
I want this off my property now.
No, no, we have got to destroy the evidence.
We've gotta rig this thing to burn.
Not here. Get it out of here.
Now, listen to me. I need your help, okay?
If I go down, we all go down. Do you understand?
All right, just...
I know a way. I know a guy that'll wipe this off the planet, no questions.
Call him.
Hey, what about Jesse?
What about him?
Hey, it's me. Wanna hear something weird?
Now, listen to me. You get that address.
Now, Badger, I don't care how. You find out where he's taking it.
Oh, yeah.
Excuse me. Are you leaving?
Excuse me, gentlemen, these booths are for paying customers only.
Cynthia, it's okay. I'll handle this.
What can I do for you?
You know.
Sunset.
Ninety-six, 97, 98, 99, 100.
Beyond recovery, right?
Beyond recovery means...
I got it. Beyond recovery.
Obliterated, no evidence.
Hey, don't worry.
When we're through with it, it's gonna be about yay big.
Then we flatbed it over to Long Beach, ship it across the Pacific.
Chinese turn it into patio furniture...
...so mind at ease.
Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm obviously gonna need a ride.
Could you call a cab?
You got it. Pleasure doing business.
Thank you. I'll be right behind you. I just need to...
The hell you think you're doing?
Me?
This is mine just as much as yours. You don't get to just...
Oh, God.
What?
What?
He's here.
Who's here?
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
You led him right to us.
Shit.
Mr. Pinkman, you wanna add resisting arrest?
We'll add it. No skin off my ass.
Last chance to do it the easy way.
Got a warrant?
Who are you, huh? Who are you and what do you know about this RV?
Well, I'm the owner of this lot...
...which means you're trespassing on private property.
As far as the RV goes, seems to me it's locked...
...which means you're trying to break and enter, so again, you got a warrant?
Well, I don't need one if I've got probable cause, counselor.
Probable cause usually relates to vehicles, is my understanding.
You know, traffic stops and whatnot.
See these round rubber things?
Those are wheels.
This is a vehicle.
This is a domicile, a residence...
...protected by the Fourth Amendment from unlawful search and seizure.
Why don't you just go out...?
Did you see this drive?
How do you know it runs?
Did you actually witness any wrongdoing?
It seems to me you're just out here fishing.
Don't see that holding up in a court of law.
Oh, yeah?
Look at these.
What do those look like to you? They sure look like bullet holes to me.
There was a firearm discharged inside of this domicile.
There's a judge or two out there who'd see that as probable cause.
Call the Albuquerque police...
How could you have known they were there before you took off the tape?
What?
How could you have known they were there before you took off the tape?
Say it. Say it.
DEA operation, there's 20 guys rushing in here like the wrath of God.
How could you have known they were there before you took off the tape?
That's right.
Probable cause needs to be readily apparent.
There's somebody in there.
"Private domicile and I won't be harassed."
I'll give you three seconds to get your ass out here. One, two...
This is my own private domicile and I will not be harassed.
Bitch.
Fine. You want your warrant?
I'll have my guys bring it and deliver it on a little satin pillow. How's that?
I waited this long. I'll wait a little longer.
Hey, Vicky.
Yeah, Schrader. Get me Merkert, will you?
You know, I say...
I say we just ram him.
All right?
I mean, we... We...
We start her up and just ram the shit out of his truck.
We make our escape. Right?
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.
So, what do we do, man, huh?
What do we...? What?
Please tell me you got something.
Yeah, I got something.
It's me.
We need your help.
Yeah.
Is this Mr. Henry R. Schrader?
Yeah. Who's this?
Sir, this is Officer Elaine Tanner with the Albuquerque police.
Is your wife Marie Schrader?
Yes, why?
I'm sorry to inform you your wife's been in an automobile accident.
She's being airlifted to Los Ranchos Medical Center...
...and should be arriving there shortly.
How is she? What's her condition?
I don't have the current information.
But I think you might wanna get there as soon as possible.
You're gonna have to start paying me more.
Marie?
I'm just checking in.
I'd love to have some idea of whether I should cook dinner or not.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Why?
Hank?
What's up?
I told you before.
You will not kill Walter White.
Not until my business with him has concluded.
We've waited long enough.
We won't wait any longer.
You'll have to.
The decision...
...is not yours to make.
Explain to me, why this man White?
He betrayed your cousin Tuco, yes.
But he's not the one who murdered him.
Was there not another man...
...who pulled the trigger?
A DEA agent.
Bolsa says the DEA is off-limits.
North of the border is my territory.
My say.
As a show of respect...
...I say yes.
The agent's name is...
...Hank Schrader.
May his death satisfy you.
ï»¿1
Why?
Why is this still under discussion?
I don't like him.
I don't care who he knows.
We're supposed to trust him with our products.
Big man.
Big Generalissimo!
Big fry cook is more like it.
The "Chicken Man."
You will do what you want.
But you have my vote.
Never trust a South American.
Dirty, dirty people.
He broke my toy! He broke my toy!
He was just having fun.
You'll get over it.
No! I hate him! I wish he was dead!
Marco.
Grab your old uncle a beer, would you?
No, no. A cold one.
This is what you wanted.
Your brother dead. Right?
You're going to have to try harder than that...
...if you want to save him.
How much longer do you think he has down there?
One minute? Maybe more? Maybe less?
Family is all.
Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.
All right, you can call my lawyer, Saul Goodman.
Talk to my lawyer, all right?
You hear me? I got nothing to say. I told you, you can call my...
Christ!
You got my cell phone number, my wife's name! How did you do it?
Talk! Who you working with?!
Yes, sir.
If you're ready to talk...
...they wanna get a statement.
Your side of what happened here.
Or we can hold them off till another time.
Maybe you wanna talk to a lawyer.
There it is.
Yo, Adrian.
Rocky called, he wants his face back.
Come on, I gotta cheer you up.
You see that? That's your get-out-of-jail-free card.
You understand get-out-of-jail-free card?
I mean, just blink once if you're following.
The DEA's worst nightmare is that face out in public.
They'll have to steer a wide berth of young Master Pinkman...
...for fear of the PR poop storm that will rain down on them...
...if this story ever gets out. I mean, this beating?
Best thing for you.
You're home free.
Good, right?
Right.
Oh, my God.
You're now the cute one of the group. Paul, meet Ringo. Ringo, Paul.
This is... I...
Jesse, I'm... I am so sorry for this. This should not have happened.
But it did.
No thanks to you.
But the plan did work.
We would've been locked up right now if we didn't lure him away. But this...
This... I just...
I never saw this coming.
So...
What...?
What happens now?
I'll tell you what happens now.
Your scumbag brother-in-law is finished.
Done.
You understand?
I will own him when this is over.
Every cent he earns...
...every cent his wife earns...
...is mine.
Anyplace he goes...
...anywhere he turns...
...I'm gonna be there...
...grabbing my share.
He'll be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana for pennies...
...and I'll be standing over him...
...to get my cut.
He'll see me when he wakes up...
...and when he crawls to sleep in whatever rat hole is left for him...
...after I shred his house down.
I will haunt his crusty ass...
...forever...
...until the day...
...he sticks a gun up his mouth...
...and pulls the trigger...
...just to get me out of his head.
That's what happens next.
My advice:
That's probably not a good strategy.
They're scared of you right now. They want nothing to do with you.
But if you hit them...
...they're forced to hit back hard.
I mean, they will turn over every rock hither, thither and yon...
...until someone spills the beans on you and anyone associated with you...
...present company included.
Yes, I think what Saul is saying makes a lot of sense.
Jesse, move on with your life.
Leave it behind, all of it.
Nothing changes...
...once I walk out of here.
I get myself a new RV and go start cooking again.
How exactly do you think...
...you're going to get away with that? They will catch you.
So what?
What?
I have a get-out-of-jail-free card.
Hey, I may have overstated the power of your face.
Not this.
If the cops catch me...
...I give them what they want the most.
You.
They nab me...
...I make a deal...
...to give up the great Heisenberg...
...and his million-dollar drug ring.
You're my free pass...
...bitch.
You're so sure.
Look, if he didn't give up my name while Hank was beating him...
...he's never going to talk.
What do you think that was, a bluff?
He wants your brother-in-law. And there's gonna be lawyers...
...creaming their Underoos for a case like that.
I'd take it myself if it wouldn't cause so much collateral damage.
And him cooking again?
Hey, when, not if, he gets caught, and he's facing 20 years...
...what'll he do then? Believe me, there's no honor among thieves.
Except for us, of course.
No, he'll...
He'll come around.
And if he doesn't...
...there may come a time to talk options.
Options?
I'm convinced Mr. Pinkman was involved...
...in the manufacture and distribution of phenyl-2 methamphetamine...
...specifically what we call the blue meth.
I tracked him to a scrap yard...
...where he stored an early-'80s camper...
...an RV.
While waiting for a warrant to search this vehicle...
...which I believe to be a rolling meth lab...
...I received a telephone call...
...telling me my wife Marie had been injured in an accident.
Upon hearing the news...
...I left Mr. Pinkman and his vehicle to tend to my wife.
Arriving at the hospital, I learned the emergency call was a hoax.
My wife, fortunately, was unharmed.
So I immediately went back to the salvage yard, but the RV was gone.
Most likely destroyed on site.
And it was at this point you drove to the home of Jesse Pinkman?
I think we're done here.
Agent Schrader needs to get home...
...get some rest.
That's fine. But just to confirm, you're taking the Fifth here?
Yeah, that's correct.
Okay. Well...
...we just wanna give you all a heads up.
Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges in this matter.
He's given a detailed version of events as he sees them.
The word of a meth head.
We know all about his history.
We're well aware, but toxicology on Pinkman...
His blood is clean, he's not using.
The kid is even refusing his doctor-ordered pain meds...
...far as we can tell.
So...
...where do we go from here?
A couple of gentlemen from OPR will come down...
...probably tomorrow morning.
Janice will give us an exact time.
And you men will be continuing your investigation, so...
Thanks for your time.
Right. We just...
We need one more thing.
A photo of Agent Schrader's hands. For the record.
Yes, of course.
Bandage off, if you would.
On the table is fine.
Flat on the table. That's fine.
It's all gonna work out.
You've been too good to them for too many years.
I hope it goes without saying we're not talking to anybody about this, okay?
Okay.
Marie...
...who?
Hi.
Do you have a minute?
Sure.
I guess crime does pay.
I don't suppose you just came by to insult me.
No. We need to talk.
You heard about Hank?
About what happened with this Jesse Pinkman?
Yes, I know.
Whatever Hank was investigating...
...him trying to find an RV...
...is there any danger...
...that could lead back to you?
No.
Why would it?
Is this why you're here?
I'm here to talk about Hank.
You know what's gonna happen to him if this Pinkman presses charges?
Hank could lose everything.
I thought maybe...
...there's a way you could help him.
How?
Contact Pinkman.
Get him to drop the charges.
I don't know what kind of relationship you picture me having with this person.
I'm not asking.
He was... He's... He's not my friend.
It's not as if we were even close.
I'm...
I'm not asking.
But there must be something you could say.
Isn't it even worth a try?
Hank is your family.
Not currently.
What?
I said, not currently.
I'm late. I have to go.
Hello.
I was starting to get worried.
Car trouble.
Oh, that's a bummer.
You should call me next time. I'll pick you up.
No sandals today?
I just thought...
A bit more professional.
Well, everything is on track.
We got our distillate. Just waiting to...
Let's get our trays ready.
Clean, no moisture.
Done.
Is our?
Our solvent filtered?
I thought you might ask that.
Done.
That's good.
Hand in glove, that's what we strive for.
You know, this might be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
So you the gentlemen?
Lucky you boys caught me, I got a load to pick up in Memphis.
I can hammer it out in about 15, but there's this girl, Lolly. Maybe Fran.
She's got this fetish, she likes to get peed on.
I was hoping to see her tonight but she wants to sleep before 10...
...so I wanna wrap it up here ASAP because traffic can be a wild card.
Thing is, women who like to get peed on tend to be from the warmer climates.
You'd think the ones in colder zones would be more inclined.
Maybe it's a shock if the body's not acclimated...
...but, you know, I leave that for smarter minds than me.
Science is a mystery.
Well, take a gander. Prices are negotiable.
Buying in bulk gets you a discount. I'm running a special on these honeys.
JHPs. Hollow-point bullets, known as Black Death. Check it out.
Like that? So sweet, you wanna lick it.
Nickel-plated brass casing, Lubalox coat.
Sucker has six razor claws that expand upon impact:
Shred your mama's head like a cabbage.
Keep it. On the house. But I been windjamming enough.
Tell me what you're looking for, what it is you need.
Vests.
Vests? Hell, yeah, we got vests.
Right here.
Sleek, comfortable, thermally bonded, non-interwoven Kevlar fiber.
Stop a bullet like a soft wang against a Quaker girl. Ain't getting through.
And lightweight? So lightweight, you'll forget you're wearing it.
They work?
Sure as shit, they do.
I don't leave home without it.
What the hell?
You broke my freaking rib, you maniac son of a bitch.
You're welcome!
Gale.
What temperature did you set here?
Here?
Station five, 75 C.
I said 85.
Eight-five.
I wrote it down. You said 75.
I wrote it.
Well, you wrote it wrong.
That's not what I said.
I said 85.
It's always been 85.
Not 75. Not 95.
Eighty-five.
This is chemistry. Degrees matter.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
Great.
You're sorry, meanwhile...
...you've just brewed 50 gallons of useless sludge. Congratulations.
Just dump it. Dump it all.
This batch is ruined.
You look nice.
I look like a TV weatherman.
You want a coffee?
No.
I squeezed some orange juice. You want a glass of orange juice?
I'm all right.
What are you gonna tell them?
Here's what you'll tell them.
He attacked you.
He attacked me?
He swung at you with something.
Swung at me?
He attacked you with a pipe.
A pipe.
It happened fast. He resisted arrest and muscle memory kicked in...
...and you had to disarm him.
Muscle memory.
Happens all the time. Years of training, your body acted faster than your brain.
You had no choice but to hit him.
You had to fight back.
Marie, Marie, Marie.
No.
I'm not gonna go in there and lie.
It's some lowlife degenerate versus you...
...doing the job you're supposed to.
Why should you be the one who pays...
...for doing the right thing?
Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing.
It's not what the job is.
I'm supposed to be better than that.
And you made one mistake.
No, it wasn't one mistake. I've been...
I've been...
...unraveling, you know?
I don't sleep at night anymore.
I freeze.
I freeze up.
My chest gets all tight. I can't breathe.
Just...
I panic.
Ever since that Salamanca thing.
I mean, Tuco Salamanca.
If ever a scumbag deserved a bullet between the eyes...
It changed me.
And I can't seem to control it.
I tried to fight it.
But then...
...El Paso.
And it's just gotten worse.
What I did to Pinkman...
...that's not who I'm supposed to be. That's not me.
All this...
...everything that's happened, I...
I swear to God, Marie, I think the universe...
...is trying to tell me something...
...and I'm finally...
...ready to listen.
I'm just not the man I thought I was.
I think I'm done as a cop.
Now, this is not an easy decision, but it is one that I have to make.
I'm sorry.
This whole Gale situation, he's...
He's just not working out.
Yes, now.
It may sound unorthodox...
...but I think our first best option...
...is Jesse Pinkman.
Hello?
No, look. There's a shorthand that exists between us...
...experience together...
...at a level that, quite frankly, I'm just never going to reach with Gale.
Look, Mr. Fring...
...when I accepted your offer, I was told the lab is mine.
And I know best how to run it.
Thank you.
Yes, I will. I will.
Okay. Goodbye.
Listen, something's come up.
I think it's a good opportunity.
There's been a job opening.
I need a new lab assistant.
I already did my time.
Why don't you just go get yourself a monkey?
I don't want a monkey.
I want you.
Oh, gee, thanks.
Well, not interested.
I got my own thing going on.
And nice try, saving your asshead brother-in-law.
That's not why I'm here, Jesse.
There's more.
It's more than an assistant.
Partners.
We'll be partners again.
Split everything fifty-fifty, just like before.
One-point-five million dollars each.
No.
I don't think you heard...
I heard you fine.
I said no.
Let me understand this.
You're turning down one and a half million dollars...
I am not turning down the money.
I am turning down you.
You get it?
I want nothing to do with you.
Ever since I met you...
...everything I've ever cared about...
...is gone.
Ruined, turned to shit...
...dead, ever since I hooked up with the great Heisenberg.
I have never been more alone.
I have nothing!
No one!
All right? It's all gone!
Get it?
No.
No, no. Why...?
Why would you get it?
What do you even care, as long as you get what you want?
Right?
You don't give a shit about me.
You said I was no good.
I'm nothing!
Why would you want me, huh?
You said my meth is inferior, right?
Right? Hey, you said my cook was garbage!
Hey, screw you, man!
Screw you.
Your meth is good, Jesse.
As good as mine.
Yeah.
Fifty-fifty.
Yes, fifty-fifty.
Okay.
Partners.
Good.
And this is the statement you want to give?
Yes, sir.
Hank, you don't have to do this.
No, I...
I do.
I'm good.
So we understand if we write it up like that, you'll sign it.
That's the way it happened.
I accept the consequences.
In the light of these facts...
...as of this moment, you're suspended without pay.
I have to ask you to hand over your badge and your gun.
Yes, sir.
Schrader.
Hold up.
Yes, sir?
I just wanted to tell you something.
And you didn't hear it from me. Don't want you to get your hopes up...
...but the word in the pipeline is Pinkman isn't pressing charges.
Why not?
Who the hell knows?
Maybe you have a guardian angel.
It went fine.
Well, fine means what it means, yeah.
I'll...
I'll tell you all about it when I get home, okay?
Yeah. It's...
Yeah, it's just...
I don't know, baby, I just think...
I think we may be okay. Yeah.
Okay. I love you too.
Schrader.
I need you to listen very carefully.
Two men are coming to kill you.
Come again?
They're approaching your car. You have one minute.
I don't get the gag, jagoff. Who is this?
They're coming.
Hello?
Hey, li...
Gomey, I don't know what that call was, but it's dumb even by your standards...
...so call me when you get this.
Finish him.
Jesus.
No.
Too easy.
ï»¿1
Think you'll be okay waiting here by yourself?
Yeah, whatever.
Sir, if you'd like to smoke, you need to be another 20 feet from the door.
So roll me further, bitch.
What's coming?
Male, Caucasian. Early 40s. Multiple gunshot wounds.
BP is 70. Seven-zero over palp.
Pulse 140. One-four-zero. Weak and thready at the brachial.
No breath sounds on the right side, belly is rigid.
Appears pale and diaphoretic. How many entry wounds?
Four. Shoulder and hip, through and through.
Right lung in lower left quadrant, no visible exit wounds.
Let's get him 2 grams of oxygen.
What's his hemoglobin?
Seven-point-three.
Need two large-bore IVs, six units O-neg.
Type and cross for six more units, chest x-ray and KUB.
Notify the OR, we are on the way.
OR 1 is clear. Let's put him in there.
Yo, Jesse, sorry I'm late, man.
Damn, brother, look at you.
That's messed up.
How are you feeling? You okay?
Actually...
...I'm great.
I don't understand.
I thought things were going pretty well.
I thought we were kind of simpatico.
You know? We were becoming a real team.
Not... Not so much, no.
Is this about the temperature setting? I can assure you that will not happen...
No, it's bigger than that, Gale.
It's much more than that.
Could you elaborate?
Well, yes, of course I could...
...but I don't think either of us...
...would necessarily benefit from a prolonged...
Yeah, so...
Yeah.
I set up the entire lab.
You said you liked the configuration.
And I do.
For the most part.
Look, you're a fine chemist, really, with a promising future.
It's just that I...
That we just have different rhythms, Gale.
You see... It's...
It's as if I'm classical...
...but you are more jazz.
Jazz.
Jazz. Yes.
And God knows there is nothing wrong with jazz.
It's simply that I require...
Classical.
Exactly.
Oh, shit.
Man, this is the bomb.
What's up, partner?
I can't believe this.
My replacement?
Oh, Jesus.
Hi. Gale.
Nice to meet you.
What's up?
Damn, we should've ditched that RV months ago.
It's all, like, shiny up in here.
I'm sorry, I must be missing something. I don't mean... I don't mean to be...
This...
No.
Makes no sense.
So I guess this is...
Oh, dear mother of God.
This is for the best.
Two hundred pounds a week. Got it?
Yeah.
Oh, man.
Mr. White.
Okay, there's a lot to show you.
Some new techniques to learn.
What, now?
Yes, now.
We've only got a couple days before our next batch is due.
And I need to get you up to speed.
Right on. I'm just saying...
How's the cell service down here?
It's nonexistent.
We're shielded.
There's a hard line for emergencies. Come on.
So you haven't talked to anybody today...
...other than, you know, Captain Nerd there.
Why?
Your brother-in-law.
What about him?
What's the story?
He was unresponsive.
You getting exposure on those wounds?
Two units of normal saline.
Bivalve mass.
Breath sounds bilaterally. Femur's like a wet bag of gravel.
Other one's not much better. Get those boots off.
See if you get a pulse. Get blood-pressure cup or an ABI?
Where's that blood?
Dr. Bording to Cardiology.
Sir, can I help you?
Yeah, I...
It's all right. He's family.
Thank you.
Marie. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, honey.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.
How is he?
I don't know.
They won't really tell us anything. He's still in surgery.
They shot him four times.
Oh, Christ.
Where's Holly?
I got a sitter.
Hey, how are you, huh?
Fine.
Yeah?
Sure?
I'm fine. I just need some fresh air.
Okay.
Here. Let me get the door.
I got it. I'm fine.
Walt. Walt, this is ASAC Merkert. Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.
Hello.
I'm very sorry.
Thank you.
Can you tell us anything? Any details?
Right now, all we know is two men ambushed Hank.
They didn't have any ID on them. Probably Mexican nationals.
Their tattoos indicated an affiliation with a drug cartel.
Why did they attack Hank?
We're not sure yet.
It could be in relation to an investigation Hank was working...
...or it could be a message to the DEA in general.
They had an axe.
The cartels tend to be dramatic.
Jesus.
Where are they? I mean, did they...?
Hank got both of them.
He killed one outright, the other one's upstairs in critical condition.
Your brother-in-law's one tough son of a bitch to take them both out...
...considering he didn't even have his gun.
He didn't have his gun?
Why didn't Hank have his gun?
Marie, the assault charge.
I had to suspend Hank pending the investigation.
That means I had to take away his weapon.
You had to take it.
It's standard procedure. No one...
Okay. All right, listen.
If you all listened to him from the start and let him arrest that degenerate...
...he wouldn't have taken things into his own hands.
And he would've had a gun and could've defended himself.
Marie, let's just...
No. Just...
It's their fault.
He didn't have a gun.
Honey, this isn't helping you.
You.
What kind of partner are you?
You were supposed to back him up, and where were you?
Where were you?
Texas.
And you.
You're supposed to protect your agents...
...instead of taking their guns...
...not supporting them, not backing them up.
Marie. Marie.
When they...
Honey, let's just go and sit down, okay?
I'm not doing anything until these two get the hell out of here. I mean it.
Sorry...
Go.
You are not welcome here.
The DEA is not welcome here.
Okay, honey.
Come on.
Come on. Let's go sit down.
It's not just them.
It's you, Walt.
This Pinkman that Hank was looking for...
...Hank would have never even heard his name...
...if you hadn't bought marijuana from him.
Marie...
Do you ever think about that, Walt?
Do you?
Do you think about everything that you have put him through?
Marie, stop.
You're upset, and you're looking for someone to blame...
...and it's understandable, but don't blame Walt.
It's not his fault.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Sweetheart...
No. No. Don't...
It's okay.
It's Hank.
It's all right.
All right, you're done.
Okay, next.
Hello.
Hello, hello, hello.
Yeah.
Yo, yo, yo. Jesse Pinkman in the house.
Oh, my dear God.
Walter White to the nearest courtesy phone.
Walter White, please pick up a courtesy phone.
Yo, we working sometime this year?
What the hell are you thinking? Why are you calling me here?
Tried your cell and it went straight to voicemail.
How am I to get a hold of you?
You aren't.
It's been a whole day. How long is this grieving process?
Just put a clock on it for me.
All I'm saying is we have a schedule, right?
My family comes before your schedule.
Dude, it's not my schedule.
We have responsibilities here.
I'll get there when I get there.
You know what? Whatever. I'll just cook on my own.
You will do no such thing.
Why not?
Well, for starters...
...you aren't the least bit familiar with any of the equipment.
There's gotta be some sort of manual, right?
And I can read.
Jesse, touch nothing.
Stop treating me like I'm like your assistant.
I'm not your bitch to order around. We're partners. Remember?
I need you to sit patiently and wait, I will be there as soon as I can.
Thank you very much for your kind words.
We really do appreciate that.
What, is your wife there?
Yes. Yes, she is.
She would be happy to know you asked about her.
Please do keep us in your thoughts.
Hey, tell your douche bag brother-in-law...
...to head towards the light.
So I'm thinking maybe we should go get everybody some breakfast.
Yeah, that sounds good. Do you know who that was?
You know, these eggs are really not too bad.
Look at that.
Look at what?
At what? This. These spots.
This fork is absolutely filthy.
Tell me you see this. You've got good eyes. Look at that.
Marie, those are just water spots.
That's fine.
Those are not "water spots."
It's dirt.
This silverware's obviously not been cleaned.
It's covered in germs from someone else's mouth.
God knows what.
Seriously, Aunt Marie, it's water spots.
Ours at home aren't any better.
Yours at home are irrelevant. We're in a hospital.
They need to be a higher standard. They have a responsibility.
Well, I'm not actually sure...
...if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies as being part of the hospital.
It's in the same building. It's all under the same roof.
Do you think that sick people...
...aren't eating with this bacteria-infested silverware?
My God, how are you supposed to survive this death trap?
Marie...
I survived.
I had my lobectomy at this hospital.
Remember that?
Remember how scared we all were?
I didn't wanna act like it, but I was terrified.
All that week, all I could think of...
...was how they were actually going to cut me open...
...and take out a part of me...
...that was with me my entire life.
I couldn't get that image out of my head.
I think the scariest part was when they took me into pre-op.
Lying there, waiting for them to anesthetize you.
Knowing that you may never wake up again.
Actually what I really remember about that day...
...is driving to the hospital.
Skyler, you remember me wanting to drive that day?
Yeah.
Anyway, there we are. We're driving up Central...
...and we hit every green light.
I mean, every single light that we hit... green.
It's just... When does that happen?
Just like, bang, bang, green the entire way.
And the whole time, all I could think about was:
"Why today? Why? Why can't I just spend...
...a few extra minutes in the car with my family?"
I never wanted to be stuck in traffic so bad in my life.
At least I was with my family.
I had that.
Anyway, I survived this place.
And I'm not half the man your husband is.
Yes?
What the hell is going on up there?
I was gonna ask you the same question.
You know about my men?
I heard that they attacked a DEA agent. Why would they do that?
What's the matter? Spanish not good enough anymore?
I didn't order this, and my men would never do this on their own.
Someone gave the go-ahead.
Are you accusing me?
I'm just saying they wouldn't act on their own.
I am not in the habit of picking my own pocket.
I assume that the next shipment will be delayed.
Any thoughts on when it might arrive?
A week, a month.
There's too much focus on the border. We lay low for the time being.
We lay low, and then we get the real story...
...from my man who survived.
Your man is in custody.
God bless America!
He's innocent until proven guilty. Correct?
I'll get him the best lawyer...
...and then we'll learn the truth.
Well, keep me apprised.
Any time you got that close proximity to the spine...
...there's always gonna be cause for concern...
...but as I say, it's really too soon to tell.
He's out of surgery, at least, which is...
Out of surgery, on his way to recovery.
All right. And where's that?
Unfortunately, you can't see him yet.
We're gonna have to wait for him to stabilize.
How long will that take?
I can't really say. It could be hours.
But we'll let you know just as soon as you can see him.
Thank you.
Maybe we should get you home for a couple hours?
Get some rest?
I'm not going anywhere.
Me neither.
Well, is anyone else dying to brush their teeth...
...or is it just me?
What if I ran over to the house and picked up a few things?
Marie? I could swing by your place.
That would be great. Thanks, Walt.
Okay.
Walt. Walt.
We just heard he came through.
Yeah, well, it's, you know, guardedly good news.
Thank God. I'll take it.
Yeah.
Hey, guys, this is Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.
Good to meet you. Hi.
Hey.
We were just swapping Hank stories.
That could go on all day.
God knows, there's a million of them.
Meanwhile...
Miserable piece of shit.
Guy who shot him, one that's left, he's up there.
Got the painkillers going on, resting comfortably.
Your tax dollars at work.
You ought to see what Hank did to that bastard.
Wanna see?
Come on, let me show you.
You comfortable, you piece of shit?
You got him?
Come on.
All right.
Easy now, easy.
Come here.
No.
Oh, shit.
Yeah.
Finally. About damn time.
Why isn't there anything cooking?
Walter White to the nearest courtesy phone.
Operator.
This is Walter White.
I'll connect you.
Yo, we got problems, big ones.
Reverend, so nice of you to call. Again.
Turn your phone on already.
You know, I will definitely look into that.
I'll tell you what. Why don't I just call you right back on my cell phone?
Okay?
I told you to wait. I don't know how many more ways I could say it.
Yeah, dick, I was waiting...
...and then that creepy, quiet guy showed up.
Gus came by?
Not him, man.
Apparently I'm not worthy of meeting him.
The other one. The one I'm qualified to speak to.
He started asking questions too.
Like why haven't we cooked anything. All right, we have a quota.
It's due tomorrow. Do you seriously not care or what?
Because that guy, he's got, like, the dead eyes.
Let me ask you something.
Do you remember when we were out in the desert with Tuco?
Oh, you mean when he put a machine gun to my head?
Yeah, I think that does ring a tiny bell. Why?
No. He kept... He kept saying...
...that someone was coming up from Mexico to get us.
Do you remember? Now, who was that?
What the hell has this got to do with...? Look, I don't know. It was...
His cousins.
Right, Jesse? It was... It was his cousins.
Yeah, cousins.
Whatever, man. Why?
Any news?
No change.
Okay, well, I didn't know whose toothbrushes were whose...
...so I just stopped by the drugstore.
Thank God for travel sizes, right?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, I think I'm gonna go wash my face.
I'm going crazy.
Do you wanna come?
Yeah.
Nurse Franklin, please page the operator.
Nurse Franklin, page the operator.
I got candy bars.
Is this what you were asking for?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, I skimmed through it.
Looks interesting.
Yeah.
Uncle Hank gave it to me.
Well, what's it about?
Pablo Escobar, this big drug guy in the '80s.
Yeah. Yeah. I remember seeing him on the news.
Well, it's more about the guys who investigated him...
...and tried to bring him down.
Some of them were DEA, you know?
Uncle Hank said that they were worth learning about...
...that everybody knows who Pablo Escobar is...
...but nobody knows about the guys that brought him down.
I guess I never thought about it.
He said that good guys never get ink like the bad guys do.
So he gave it to me.
Figured I'd read it.
I need to...
I'll be right back, okay?
Okay.
No, I assure you. We are hard at work. Absolutely.
So I can expect delivery by tomorrow as scheduled.
Well...
Unfortunately...
Unfortunately...
...we're not going to be able to keep our schedule this week.
But not for lack of trying.
Is there something I should know?
Well, to be completely honest with you...
...Gale really screwed us up.
I mean, not on purpose, of course, but he just... He set us way back.
And we've been playing catch-up ever since.
And I've had to be out running errands...
...and trying to keep us on target.
Some of the equipment wasn't calibrated correctly...
Well, it's just all very technical and boring.
But rest assured that...
That we will do whatever it takes.
It has my total attention.
We'll cook through the weekend if necessary.
We will have 400 pounds for you by next week.
I have your word on that?
You do. You have my word on that.
Thank you for the update.
Yeah. Right.
Any news?
No, I'm just wandering.
How's everybody doing?
Well, as well as can be expected.
It's this not knowing...
...that's the hardest part, I think.
Anything new on these guys?
Who they are? What they wanted?
No, nothing yet, but we'll get it.
Steve...
Do you think there could maybe be others?
Buddy, nobody's getting to Hank.
That was their one shot and they blew it.
So no.
No way.
Jesus.
I'd love to walk in there and shoot that bastard right in the head.
Me too.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Great. We'll be right down.
Food's here.
Hey, you like Pollos Hermanos?
You guys coming?
Yeah.
On occasion, yeah.
Owner's a big booster for the DEA.
He heard what happened. He's gonna feed every cop in the building.
That's wonderful.
Yeah.
And, apparently, he's bringing it by personally.
I don't even know what to say.
That's an incredible...
Good, huh?
Delicious.
That's so generous of you. Thank you very much.
Yes, thank you. Guys, did you hear that?
Mr. Fring is offering a 10,000-dollar reward...
...on any information about the case.
Well, that's... That's wonderful.
Wow, thank you, Mr. Fring.
You're very welcome. Men like your husband...
...are the thin blue line between us and these animals.
I only wish I could do more.
Well, we do appreciate your support.
This reward could turn the tide here. It'll really help.
Again, I can't express how sorry I am.
As it happens, I actually met Agent Schrader.
Really?
Our fund run, couple of months ago.
Mr. Fring was one of our sponsors.
I talked for a few minutes with your husband.
As a matter of fact, Mr. White, your name came up.
Really?
Yeah, there happened to be a collection jar out for you...
...and we spoke briefly about your health concerns.
I hope that there's been good news.
Things have improved, yes.
That's wonderful to hear.
It was clear to me how deeply he cares for you.
Well, I have taken up enough of your time.
Thank you again very much. It was a great pleasure to meet you.
Thank you.
Yes, thank you.
Let me walk you out.
Oh, no, it's not necessary.
It's amazing.
You know, I didn't say thank you.
I'll walk him out. Be right back.
Good to see you. Enjoy the chicken?
Good. Good.
Excuse me.
My pleasure. My pleasure.
Thank you. Thank you.
It's good chicken, huh? Good.
Yeah.
Mr. Fring.
Mr. White.
I just wanted to thank you again.
It's my pleasure.
May I...? May I speak with you? Just a moment.
You knew.
You knew my brother-in-law was with the DEA.
I investigate everyone with whom I do business.
What careful man wouldn't?
He is not a problem for us, for our business.
Your being here is...
Is this some sort of message?
I'm supporting my community.
I hide in plain sight, same as you.
Are we done?
No, listen, I...
This attack on my brother-in-law, I don't understand it.
I don't know what it means.
Please, if you have some knowledge...
...that you could share with me...
I fear for my family.
I'm sure they'll be fine.
I am told the assassin that survived is gravely injured.
It's doubtful he'll live.
Now thank me and shake my hand.
Thank you. Thank you again.
You're quite welcome, Mr. White.
Did you hear that?
We're going up?
Come on.
What's going on?
What's happening?
Starting chest compressions. One, two, three, four.
One, two, three...
Defib?
Patient is in asystole. Continuing chest compressions.
One, two, three, four.
Give me a liter of saline.
I can't get a pulse.
One, two, three, four.
Still nothing.
All right, stopping compressions.
Time?
Eight forty-three.
Time of death, 20:43.
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.
Yes? Juan?
I assume you heard the news.
Your man died. I heard.
It's unfortunate.
Yeah, unfortunate.
And meanwhile, I have Federales surrounding my house.
You know what I think, Gustavo? I think you're behind all this.
Why would I do this?
How would it serve me?
That's the part I'm trying to figure out.
Go off on your own, maybe.
Would you actually think that would work?
Juan, you sound like you're under a lot of stress.
You should call me back when you're seeing things more clearly.
I see things clear enough.
One DEA gets shot, all of Washington starts barking.
D.F. Suddenly has to put on a big show...
...and I wind up with Federales in my rosebushes.
But just for a while.
Appearances, politics.
Are you still there, Gustavo?
Yes.
I'm here.
I'll weather this. I always do.
My brother's a police chief.
I got connections. They'll get me through.
And when I get proof...
...and the others find out what you've done...
...maybe we come pay you a visit.
Maybe we can...
Skyler. Skyler. Marie. Marie.
Oh, how is he? Tell me something good.
I think he's stable enough now for you to go see him briefly.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid it's immediate family only.
We're all family.
I understand.
But we have a certain protocol here that we need...
We're all family.
ï»¿1
In the little village where I was born, life moved at a slower pace...
...yet felt all the richer for it.
There, my two uncles were known far and wide for their delicious cooking.
They seasoned their zesty chicken...
...using only the freshest herbs and spices.
People called them Los Pollos Hermanos...
..."The Chicken Brothers."
Today, we carry on their tradition...
...in a manner that would make my uncles proud.
The finest ingredients are brought together with loving care...
...then slow-cooked to perfection.
Yes, the old ways are still best at Los Pollos Hermanos.
But don't take my word for it. One taste and you'll know.
Two-oh-one-point-six.
Jesus, seriously.
Better over than under.
Over by a pound and a half.
I thought you were all, like, precise.
Whatever. We'll just save it out till next week.
We ship it as is.
What, are we running a charity? Come on, man. We're gonna take it out.
Leave it. One batch, one ship.
Stop complicating things.
Why are you purposely giving him free meth?
These bitches are bleeding us enough already.
You are paid extraordinarily well.
Why can't you just appreciate that?
Yeah. Hey, I been crunching numbers.
Oh, you've been crunching numbers?
Yeah.
And I don't gotta be a mathematician to figure out...
...that this deal you made is bullshit.
We both earn...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
A million and a half each.
What's he getting, huh?
Say he's wholesaling at 40 large a pound.
That's probably high.
High. What, for our stuff? That's what I was getting.
All right, look, say he's getting 40 a pound.
All right, 200 pounds a week for three months.
And, like, what happens at the end of the three months? Look, whatever.
Two hundred pounds a week for three months. That's 2400 pounds.
Twenty-four hundred times 40,000 is...
And I swear to God, I double-checked this like 10 times.
Ninety-six million dollars.
All right? Ninety-six million.
Ninety-six to our three.
That is messed up, yo.
That is so messed up.
Fairness-wise, I can't even...
Jesse.
You are now a millionaire and you're complaining?
What world do you live in?
One where the dudes who are actually doing all the work ain't getting fisted.
What is going on with you lately?
What's happened to you?
Hang on, can't we just...?
Hey, we gotta hash this out.
Hey, what's more important than money?
These things they laughingly call pillows...
...I would not give them to prison inmates.
You want me to go ask for another?
No, just remind me to bring his from home.
They're not moving his legs enough.
Hey, everybody.
Hi, Marie. Is it okay if I visit?
Yeah.
His color looks good.
Gomey, is that you?
Buddy, yeah, it's me.
That's you, Gomey?
Yeah, Hank. I'm right here.
Come here. Closer.
What is it?
Closer.
Asshole.
Man, he got you good.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm glad to see you still have your twisted sense of humor.
God.
Hey, check this out.
I got something that'll make you feel better.
Been keeping an eye on that blue meth of yours. Six, seven weeks, nothing.
Then all of a sudden, boom, it's popping up everywhere.
Look at the new locations. Texas, Nevada, up in Farmington.
Even right here in town.
A teener here and there, you know, strictly street-level amounts.
Man, it's crazy.
How exactly is that supposed to make me feel better?
Because you were right.
You're the only one that saw this coming.
Well, three cheers for me.
This thing doesn't do a damn thing.
Hank, it's probably still on lock-out.
It's been an hour, right?
I'm hurting here. I could use some meds.
I'll go find somebody.
Hey, no more shop talk.
Sorry.
I didn't see it coming.
What? Damn right, you did.
No, I didn't see shit.
Day late and dollar short, as usual.
The only reason I'm even breathing...
...is I got a warning call.
A warning call? What do you mean?
One minute before they attacked me...
...somebody called my cell and told me to expect it.
A voice scrambler. Could have been anybody.
Marie's got my phone somewhere, if you want to run the incoming.
Not that you're gonna learn anything worth knowing.
I don't get it. Cartel hit?
Who would have called to warn you?
I don't know.
Oh, Jesus.
Come on already.
Okay.
Skyler, I had nothing to do...
Are we safe?
Yes.
Are you safe?
Absolutely.
Jesse?
What about you?
Face looks better.
How's it all going? Anything you wanna tell us about?
What, like my interesting life?
One day pretty much bleeds into the next.
Been working a lot.
Got a job.
Job is good.
It's in a Laundromat. It's totally corporate.
Corporate Laundromat.
It's, like, rigid. All kinds of red tape. My boss is a dick.
The owner, super dick.
I'm not worthy to meet him, but everybody's scared of the dude.
The place is full of dead-eyed douche bags...
...the hours suck and nobody knows what's going on, so...
Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.
Yeah.
Totally Kafkaesque.
Majorly.
From the U.S. Attorney in Santa Fe.
Very nice.
You've got all these nice tulips and baby's breath.
Oh, and this is chrysanthemum. That looks like chrysanthemum.
Yeah.
Look at these, Hank.
Aren't they beautiful?
Beautiful.
Wow, look at the size of this basket. It's got so many goodies in it.
Look, chocolate-covered pretzels and cheese sticks...
...and some fancy designer olives.
You had me at cheese sticks. You're gonna have to fight me for those, Hank.
"Get well and best wishes from Ted Beneke...
...and all the folks at Beneke Fabricators."
Wow, he gives you all this time off and now this.
Get me a job there.
I know. He's great.
Boss hall of fame. I don't see anything here from Kleinman.
They're gonna have to get on the stick.
How's everybody doing today?
Good. We're good.
How are you?
I'm very good.
Hi, Hank. Just gonna do a quick peripheral response, all right?
See where we're at.
Moment of truth?
Yeah, I wouldn't call it that.
All right, let's just take a look here.
All right.
All right, now I want you to tell me if you can feel this.
All right.
How about this?
Okay.
How about now?
Do that one again, would you?
Right there?
Yeah, yeah, I feel a tingle.
Okay, on a scale of one to ten...
...ten being your normal level of feeling and one being no feeling at all.
Oh, I don't know.
Four?
Okay, four. Okay.
And how about there?
Yeah. A six.
Okay, good. And here.
Yeah, still there. A little less.
A three.
Okay.
All right, good.
Thank you very much, Hank. Did good.
So this is good news, right?
Oh, yeah, definitely.
Gosh.
It looks like some nerve function is returning.
Oh, thank God.
All right, so when do we get him walking again?
Marie, it's important that we manage our expectations.
We're talking about months of very hard work.
And even then, the odds, they're not great.
But you can't know for sure.
No.
When does he start physical therapy?
We've sent the paperwork to your insurance.
It's high-priority. We should have pre-authorization in the next few days.
Certainly by early next week.
Next week?
No, that's not gonna do it.
I've looked into this.
And the sooner physical therapy begins, the better his chances are.
He needs daily sessions. Isn't that right?
Well...
Actually...
...your plan's treatment program covers four sessions a week.
Actually, she asked the doctor.
Plan-wise, four treatments a week is fairly typical.
And the therapists in your network are mostly fine.
Mostly fine. Okay, well, there's a ringing endorsement.
Look, if Hank had more physical therapy with better therapists...
...wouldn't it be more likely he would walk?
It's very hard to say, Marie.
Is the health plan's way medically justifiable? Sure.
Is it absolutely optimal?
You know, screw it.
I'll make sure he gets what he needs. They can reimburse me.
Mrs. Schrader, I get your frustration. Really, I do.
But my best advice is stay in the network. Don't go out of pocket.
Physical therapy is just the beginning.
We're talking nursing care, modifications to your home...
...occupational therapy, medical equipment.
It could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
So what?
We're just supposed to compromise on his care?
Well, if you don't follow the insurance company's procedures...
...they may never pay you back.
I've seen patients and their families go bankrupt waiting to be reimbursed.
Who is the best physical therapist that you know?
I can give you some names.
But they're not likely to be on your plan.
To hell with the plan.
There he is. Finally. I went ahead and started without you.
Ladies, this is Jesse-san. He's in for the full treatment.
Hey, kick off your shoes. Lay back.
Exfoliate.
Maybe later.
Where's the maestro, out parking the minivan?
Do I look like his shadow?
Who cares where he's at? What am I doing here?
Well, I was gonna have you two flip a coin.
But since the genius can't be bothered, today's your lucky day.
Look around, kiddo. It's all yours.
What?
This?
Yeah.
You are now the owner of this fine establishment.
For free?
Free?
Oh, ladies, cover your ears. No, not free.
Look, hey, this is a squeaky-clean, highly profitable...
At least potentially.
Local institution looked upon with favor by the Chamber of Commerce...
...Better Business Bureau. At $312,000, it's a steal.
Three-hundred-and-twelve thousand?
Don't you get it? On the outside, it's a nail salon, right?
On the inside, it's the best money laundry a growing boy could ask for.
Wait, wait, wait. Hey.
Ladies, thank you. Thank you. Good job. Come back here.
Sit. Come on, come on.
Humor me here for a second.
Now, you know you need to launder your money, right?
Do you understand the basics of it, placement, layering, integration?
I ain't buying no damn nail salon, so just forget it.
Don't you want to stay out of jail?
I mean, you wanna keep your money and your freedom.
Because I got three little letters for you: IRS.
If they can get Capone, they can get you.
Hey, look. Here's you, right? Pink, Pinkman. Get it?
Okay, here's your cash.
You're out on the town. Yeah, you're partying hearty.
You're knocking boots with the chicky babes. Oh, who's this?
It's the tax man. And he's looking at you.
Now, what does he see?
He sees a young fellow with a big fancy house...
...unlimited cash supply and no job.
Now, what is the conclusion the tax man makes?
I'm a drug dealer.
Wrong.
Million times worse. You're a tax cheat.
What do they do? They take every penny...
...and you go in the can for felony tax evasion.
What was your mistake?
You didn't launder your money.
Now, you give me your money, okay? That's called placement.
Hand me that little thing... Bin.
This is the nail salon, right?
I take your dirty money and I slip it into the salon's nice clean cash flow.
That's called layering.
Final step, integration.
The revenues from the salon go to the owner. That's you.
Your filthy drug money has been transformed...
...into nice, clean, taxable income...
...brought to you by a savvy investment in a thriving business.
So you want me to buy this place so I can pay taxes.
I'm a criminal, yo.
Yeah, and if you wanna stay a criminal and not become, say, a convict...
...maybe you should grow up and listen to your lawyer.
Right, so you can get your 5 percent.
No, that's 17 percent.
I heard you say 5. You said it right in front of me.
Yeah, that was for your partner. It's privileges of seniority and all.
But for you, it's the usual, 17 percent and that's a bargain.
Hey, what? You... Hey, listen...
Come on, I'm talking to you about your future here. Listen to reason.
How is your brother-in-law?
He'll live.
Good. I'm glad.
Walter, you seem troubled.
How can I help you?
I asked to see you in order to clear the air.
There are some issues that could cause a misunderstanding between us...
...and I think it's in our best interests to just lay the cards on the table.
That's the best way to do business.
My brother-in-law, moments before he was attacked...
...someone called to warn him.
I believe that same person was protecting me.
Those two men, the assassins...
...I believe I was their prime target.
But that somehow, they were steered away from me to my brother-in-law.
Because of this intervention...
...I am alive.
And yet I think that this person...
...was playing a much deeper game.
He made that phone call because he wanted a shootout...
...not a silent assassination.
In one stroke, he bloodied both sides...
...set the American and Mexican governments against the cartel...
...and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the Southwest.
If this man had his own source of product on this side of the border...
...he would have the market to himself.
The rewards would be enormous.
We're both adults.
I can't pretend I don't know that person is you.
I want there to be no confusion.
I know I owe you my life.
And more than that...
...I respect the strategy.
In your position...
...I would have done the same.
One issue which troubles me...
...I don't know what happens when our three-month contract ends.
What would you like to happen?
You know why I do this.
I want security for my family.
Then you have it.
Three million for three months. That was our agreement.
Extended annually, 12 million a year.
Call it 15.
Open-ended.
Would that be agreeable?
Part of the reason we talk about what gets us riled up in our daily lives...
...is to help each other put a finger on what our relapse triggers might be...
...head off our disease before it comes back.
So, anyone?
Free license to bitch and moan. How often do you get that?
Jesse, last time, you seemed down about your job at the Laundromat.
Let me ask something. If you had the chance to do anything you wanted...
...what would you do?
Make more green, man. A lot more.
Forget about money. Assume you have all you want.
I don't know.
I guess I would make something.
Like what?
I don't know if it even matters...
...but work with my hands, I guess.
Building things, like carpentry or bricklaying or something?
I took this vo-tech class in high school, woodworking.
I took a lot of vo-tech classes, because it was just a big jerk-off.
But this one time, I had this teacher by the name of...
...Mr. Pike.
I guess he was like a Marine or something before he got old.
He was hard of hearing.
My project for his class...
...was to make this wooden box.
You know, like a small...
Just like a... Like a box, you know, to put stuff in.
So I wanted to get the thing done as fast as possible.
I figured I could cut classes for the rest of the semester...
...and he couldn't flunk me as long as I, you know, made the thing.
So I finished it in a couple days.
And it looked pretty lame, but it worked...
...you know, for putting stuff in or whatnot.
So when I showed it to Mr. Pike...
...for my grade...
...he looked at it and said:
"Is that the best you can do?"
At first I thought to myself, "Hell yeah, bitch.
Now give me a D and shut up so I can go blaze one with my boys."
I don't know. Maybe it was the way he said it, but...
It was like he wasn't exactly saying it sucked.
He was just asking me honestly, "Is that all you got?"
And for some reason, I thought to myself:
"Yeah, man, I can do better," so I started from scratch.
I made another, then another.
And by the end of the semester, by like box number five...
...I had built this thing.
You should have seen it. It was insane.
I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut with inlaid zebrawood.
It was fitted with pegs, no screws.
I sanded it for days until it was smooth as glass.
Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil so it was rich and dark.
It even smelled good.
You know, you put nose in it and breathed in, it was...
It was perfect.
What happened to the box?
I gave it to my mom.
Nice.
You know what I'm gonna say, don't you?
It's never too late.
They have art co-ops that offer classes...
...adult extension program at the university.
You know, I didn't give the box to my mom.
I traded it for an ounce of weed.
He's a hero. You don't deny coverage to a hero.
They'll say they're not denying coverage.
No, no, I'm agreeing with you.
But I went through all this with Walt.
You'll burn through your savings, and then what?
Well, you two managed, right?
You said yourself...
...that Elliot and Gretchen's money didn't cover everything.
Jesus, I gotta get back.
What? No.
No, no, no, you should rest.
Look, why don't you go in and take a long bath?
I put some fresh sheets on the bed.
I wanna be there in case he wakes up.
With all they're giving him, he'll sleep till morning.
Hey, Sky.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Thought I'd stop by...
...to see how you're holding up. Is this a bad time?
Hi.
Hi.
Marie, this is Ted, my boss.
Oh, you're Ted.
I've heard so much about you.
Thank you for your gift basket.
That was really thoughtful.
It was nice. Thank you.
Cheese sticks.
Cheese sticks.
You're welcome. We care about Skyler so much...
...that naturally that extends to the whole family.
Are you coming in?
Oh, yeah, you should.
I'm sorry. Come on in, Ted.
Thanks. Okay.
We were having some wine. Would you like a glass?
No, no, thanks. I'm just on my way home.
I just thought I'd...
You know, I am really beat. I think I'm gonna take that bath.
It was nice to meet you, Ted, and thank you again.
Nice to meet you, too, Marie. Give my best wishes to your husband.
I will.
Thanks for stopping by...
...but it's actually not the best time for a visit, so...
Can we just talk for a minute?
I know you need to be with your family...
...but I haven't heard from you in days...
...and I left messages...
I'm so sorry.
You gave me all that time off and I really should've...
That's not my point. I care about you. That's all.
Ted, I... It's just this whole thing with Hank...
...has been one nonstop horror show, you know, so...
Well, I just want you to know that I'm here for you.
Thank you.
But I really do need you to...
Okay.
Okay?
Skyler, I gotta say, your sister seeing me here...
...I mean, so what? I'm divorced. You're divorced. So what?
Okay, let's talk about it later, Ted, okay?
Is there some reason for secrecy?
Later. Not now.
Skyler, just tell me...
You really wanna do this now?
Are you gonna make me do this right now?
Yeah, you're right.
Bad idea to come here.
Ted, I'm...
I'll see you in a day or two.
Back at the office.
Take as much time as you want.
I can't believe you had to crush the RV.
Must've been, like, depressing.
For real. That's a stone loss.
No one misses it more than me.
Free to cook anytime, anywhere.
No quotas, no one to answer to.
What's the point of being an outlaw when you got responsibilities?
Darth Vader had responsibilities. He was responsible for the Death Star.
True that. Two of them bitches.
Just saying. Devil's advocate.
I gotta pay taxes? What's up with that? That's messed up. That's Kafkaesque.
Church.
Right.
Let's kick it back into gear. All right? Let's start slinging again.
Let's do it. Life's too short, I say.
Hells yeah, bitches.
We don't need no RV. All we need is a bicycle, some Drano, soda bottles.
No, no. No shake-and-bake. Where's your self-respect? Come on.
Ain't top-shelf, but we could at least move it.
Still kind of dry out there. It'll sell on the street.
And who says we sell on the street?
Maybe I know a whole new market.
Maybe all we need is the meth.
What's the yield?
Hey.
The yield. Come on.
Two-oh-one-point-eight.
I see a couple new faces.
Anybody wanna introduce themselves?
Don't all speak at once.
Yeah.
So my name's Brandon.
Okay, Brandon. You wanna tell us something about yourself?
Well, why I'm here...
...it's just one thing.
It's meth.
It's bad.
Thought I had it kicked a couple times, you know.
But then, Jesus...
...this new version of it hit the streets...
...and, wow.
Not that blue stuff.
Oh, sorry. I didn't raise my hand.
No, go ahead. This is what we do.
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.
You had it too?
Yeah, bro.
I wish I never even heard of it.
It was like lighting my whole head on fire.
Yeah. That stuff will burn you down.
Only reason I have a hope in hell is because it's long gone.
That's the shame of it.
No, no, man. Don't tell me that.
I hear it's back in town.
Stay strong, brother. Stay strong.
It's gonna be okay.
I swear to God, I'll do it. I will go to the press.
I'll go to 48 Hours. I'll go to Nightline. Don't know if there's Nightline anymore.
Doesn't matter. They will all take it and they will run with it...
...because he is a hero and he is not going to be in a wheelchair at 43.
Jesus.
Listen, Marie.
I know Skyler's already told you this...
...but if there's ever anything that you need, anything at all...
It's good to have you here.
Both of you.
I just wish there was something more that we could do.
Walt.
We can always pay their bills.
Please, it's tens of thousands of dollars.
We have the money, more than enough. Walt earned it.
Skyler.
I think Marie should know the truth.
Skyler, I really don't think this is a good idea.
I think that...
He earned it gambling.
Walt and I...
...we've had our problems lately. You know that.
And what it all came down to really...
...was money.
Pure and simple.
When Walt was diagnosed...
...it changed him.
And looking back, I don't think I ever really understood...
...what it was that he was going through.
It was more than facing death.
It was knowing that he was gonna leave behind...
...nothing.
And so that's how this all started. For better or worse...
...he wanted to provide.
And so he paid his medical bills the only way he knew how.
I thought that Elliot and Gretchen paid for your treatment.
Yeah, I thought so too.
The truth is he never took their money. Not a dime.
He was too proud to take what he considered to be charity.
Isn't that right?
So he put his mind to it and...
Well, you know how Walt is.
He's a problem-solver.
And he read books and he did a whole bunch of research...
...and he came up with this system.
A system?
A system for counting cards in blackjack.
What do you mean, like Rain Man?
Well, I don't pretend to understand, you know, all the details...
...but he was convinced that if he put enough money into it, he'd have a...
God, what is it?
A statistical edge?
Yes, statistical...
So...
Yeah.
So he, every spare minute, Walt was at some card table somewhere.
And at first he went to the casinos, but then he realized that...
But then he realized that the casinos report your winnings to the IRS.
And if it gets reported, your family might find out.
If you do not want your family to find out, you find another place to gamble.
Like an illegal backroom game.
You remember all those long walks that Walt used to take...
...all that time he used to spend away from home?
I guess for a couple months there...
...you were sort of leading a double life, weren't you?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, your fugue state.
Was that some sort of cover?
No, no.
He did not fake that, Marie.
The night that Walt disappeared...
...he lost $14,000.
It was his pension fund, our savings...
...basically every last dime we had to our name, gone.
He couldn't live with it.
He was suicidal.
But you have to understand that as soon as he got out of the hospital...
...he went right back to gambling. I mean, that's how deep this went.
How could you do that to her, Walt?
Anyway, this system of his?
He finally got it to work.
So all this is to say we have the money.
No more gambling.
But we have the money.
How much money?
Walt?
Well...
...it's into seven figures.
Holy Mary, mother of God.
What can I say?
I did very well.
Marie...
...you will take our money.
Use it to take care of Hank.
Please. Marie, let us help.
Does Walt, Jr. Know about this?
Absolutely not.
And I need to keep it that way.
And Hank, okay? Hank's got enough on his mind right now.
Can we please keep this between us?
Yeah. Yeah, I...
Yeah, I just... I need to...
Yeah, okay. We'll talk about it later.
How did you come up with that?
I mean, where did you possibly...?
I learned from the best.
Somehow...
...something tells me that Hank is here because of you.
And I'm not forgetting that.
ï»¿1
Surprised he doesn't make us do that.
The pack totally has a pecking order.
And the head hyena, he's the man, you know.
All the other ones have to, like, kiss his ass.
I mean, literally. It's so gross.
They have to lick his junk.
I can't believe they even showed it on TV.
Yo, if this is supposed to be all, like, major-league and all...
...we should have equipment maintainer guys.
And water boys, you know?
Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.
Get us a couple flunkies in here.
Treat us right.
Okay, 15 hours starts now.
I'm gonna hit it, if that's cool with you.
I don't understand.
What?
These numbers, they just don't add up.
Told you. Dude's totally boning us.
No, it's not that.
It's our output. We're off. We're. 14 percent off.
Point one-four. That's, what, like...?
What does that mean?
It means we should be netting more than we're netting.
So how far off are we?
It's not negligible.
Ball-parking at it, I'd say we're a quarter to a half a pound shy.
That's weird.
Well, what about spillage?
Spillage?
You know, when, like, just stuff gets spilled.
Nothing gets spilled.
A little maybe.
Nothing gets spilled.
What about evaporation?
It wouldn't account for this much. The materials aren't out that long.
What about the other one?
The drops, like on...
Like on, like, cold beer.
Condensation?
Yeah.
No.
Well, what about the crap that gets left behind?
You know, all the gunk we scrape out of the vats.
Gotta add up to like a gallon each.
Did you work that in?
Vestiges.
Yeah. Vestiges.
Bet that's it.
Bet that's totally it.
Hey, Mr. White.
Mr. White.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, why?
Nothing.
Are you coming?
Yeah, in a minute.
All right, see you tomorrow.
All right.
Shit.
Bastard.
Son of a...
Come on, you...
Come on, come on.
Son of a...
Come on.
Son of a bitch.
That's great.
All right.
You little bastard.
Shut the door!
My ears are popping.
Shut the door. Move.
Feels like on an airplane. What the hell's doing that?
Positive pressure.
Positive what?
God, it frigging kills, yo.
Well, just move your jaw around.
I am moving it around.
It's not working.
Just yawn or something.
Stop acting like such a baby.
Damn.
What positive? Positive what?
Pressure. I've turned the ventilation up to keep the outside out.
There's been a contamination.
Wait. What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hold up.
Something got into the lab.
So, what do we do?
I mean, do we...?
Wait. Wait. I mean, shouldn't we be wearing masks?
No, no, it's not that kind of contaminant.
So it's, like, not dangerous?
Mr. White, talk to me here.
Not to us particularly, no.
What the hell is that?
This is...
I made it.
So exactly what kind of contaminant are we dealing with here?
A fly.
What do you mean?
A fly, like... Like, what do you mean?
I mean, a fly. A housefly.
Like one fly?
Singular?
What did it do?
It got into the lab.
I'm trying to get it out. Okay? Understand?
No, man, not really. I can't say that I'm really following you here.
Dude, you scared the shit out of me!
When you say it's contamination, I mean...
...I'm thinking like an Ebola leak or something.
Ebola.
Yeah, it's a disease on The Discovery Channel...
...where all your intestines sort of just slip out of your butt.
Thank you. I know what Ebola is. Now, tell me.
What would a West African virus be doing in our lab?
So you're chasing around a fly and in your world, I'm the idiot.
Jesse, listen.
This fly... No, any fly cannot be in our lab.
It's a problem. It's a contamination.
And that is in no way a misuse of the word. Okay?
So in terms of keeping our cook clean and our product unadulterated...
...we need to take this very seriously.
Now do you understand?
So is that your fly-saber?
This is a swatter.
And it happens to work quite well, thank you.
Hey, what happened to your head?
Nothing. I'm fine.
You didn't hit it, like really, really hard?
My head is not the problem, Jesse. The fly is the problem.
You didn't happen to maybe try our product, did you?
Jesse, I know this seems unusual to you, a layman.
A fly. I get it. It seems insignificant, right?
But trust me, in a highly controlled environment such as this...
...any pollutant...
...no matter how small...
...could completely...
Hello?
What?
Were you here all night?
Have you even slept?
No. Jesse, look. I'm fine, okay?
Will you just please focus on...?
Okay, look, we're running late, so let's just get started.
The sooner we do it, the sooner we're done.
Fricking finally.
What are you doing?
It's time to alkaline.
Have you not heard a word I said?
No cooking until this fly is dealt with.
Have I been speaking to myself?
The timer went off, yo.
How long is this batch gonna be good for? An hour? Two?
The batch will be good for nothing if we don't clear the contaminant.
"Clear the contaminant."
We're making meth here, all right? Not space shuttles.
We're making nothing until we catch this fly.
What fly? All right?
Where the hell is this fly? Not like I even seen the thing.
Maybe your positive pressure blew it out the door or something.
No, no, it is here. It is around, okay?
He's around, and I am not going to expose this batch...
...to the open air and contamination, period.
Now, you can leave me to deal with this myself or you can help me.
But you are right. We're running out of time.
So I need your answer right now.
Okay.
Hey, tick-tock, yo.
Look, I like making cherry product, but let's keep it real, all right?
We make poison for people who don't care.
We probably have the most un-picky customers in the world.
No, no, no. No rationalizing.
We'll find it any minute. Don't give up.
Did you know that there's an acceptable level of rat turds...
...that can go into candy bars?
That's the government, Jack.
Even the government doesn't care that much about quality.
You know what is okay to put in hotdogs, huh?
Pig lips and assholes.
But I say, hey, have at it, bitches, because I love hotdogs.
And, you know, see what I'm try...?
What are you doing?
Oh, hey.
Look, let me just top it off, all right, really quick.
You know, a little sodium hydroxide, shut the lid.
No harm done. Then we're golden.
It stays closed. That's an order.
You can't order shit, Adolf, all right? We're 50-50 partners, remember?
God, what is your problem?
Freaking psycho.
Jesse.
Oh, God.
It, like, hit bone.
Jesse.
Jesse.
You see it, right?
You see it?
Yeah.
Get it.
You want me to get it?
Yes.
Slow. Move slowly.
I know. I'm moving slowly, yeah.
Absolutely. I'm just gonna need your swatter thing.
Come on.
Oh, yeah. It's okay, come on.
Yeah.
Yeah, come on.
Just make it count.
Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna... I'm gonna make it count, all right.
Okay. Now, on three.
Okay.
One...
Motherfuck...!
Yeah. You like that, huh? Hurts, huh?
Did you get it?
I think so, yeah.
Where is it?
I don't know. What does it matter?
Who cares? I got it.
Oh, Jesus, seriously?
Where is it?
It's right there. Look.
Look. See? I told you I got it.
This is a raisin.
Look, I definitely got it, man, all ri...
Oh, man.
He's got some skills, yo.
I'll give him that.
Look.
I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you...
...but once more, I shall try.
This fly is a major problem for us.
It will ruin our batch.
And we need to destroy it and every trace of it so we can cook.
Failing that...
...we're dead.
There is no more room for error.
Not with these people.
All right, how about we go get some air?
"Get some air"?
Your answer to, "We're sliding headfirst...
...into a massive crap..."
Hey, hey, hey, Mr. White.
All right, I understand that the fly is a serious thing now.
All right? I'm on board.
I'm just saying, you know, maybe if we went and got some air...
...it would help us come up with a plan on how to catch it.
Then come back down here and subtract his ass.
Oh, wait, do you have your keys?
Yeah.
You sure? Last thing we need is to get locked out.
Yeah. Hey!
If you're not gonna help me, stay out of my way!
Hey!
Yo, yo, does somebody have an ax I can use?
There we go.
Say good night.
Son of a bitch!
Son of a...
Damn it.
Where in the hell is that?
What the hell?
Need some juice maybe?
Knock yourself out.
It's a real one.
Yeah, like yours was working.
No, no, no.
Look, we're trying to decontaminate.
You don't decontaminate by contaminating further.
What the hell is all this?
Here, how about this?
"Non-toxic glue strips."
Yeah, baby. It's got pheromones, all right? I got a butt-Ioad.
We hang them up all over the place. It won't be able to resist.
I sure hope we have enough.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say yeah.
Do you see him?
How long do you think you've been awake?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Just figure, you know, you could use some coffee, is all. I know I could.
How about it?
Yeah.
You take cream and sugar?
Black is fine.
Why don't you just leave him be?
Let the traps do the work.
These pheromones are supposed to kick ass.
Bet we catch this mofo any second.
Thank you.
You ever have, like, a wild animal trapped in your house?
Not that I can recall, no.
We did, this one time, back when it was my aunt's house...
...back before she died of cancer.
It was a possum. Big freaky-looking bitch.
Hey, since when did they change it to "opossum"?
What's up with that? I mean, when I was coming up, it was just "possum."
You know, "opossum" makes it sound like he's Irish or something.
I mean, why they gotta go changing everything?
Whatever. It's just big rats anyways.
Giant pink-tailed rats with their pink rat faces.
Totally freaky, like alien rats.
Actually, it's not so much that he got trapped...
...but he was living there, you know, under the house.
You could hear him going from, like, room to room...
...always scurrying around.
Sometimes I'd see him outside at night and it would just, you know, freeze.
I mean, it's like you're not looking right at it, right?
I mean, it thinks it's fooling you.
That's what they do. I mean, they play dead or whatever.
It's just so lame.
Is there a discernible point to this story?
A point that you'll be arriving at sometime in the near future?
It was just a total bitch to get out. You know, it took forever.
Guy came, set all these traps and all and he finally got it.
But my aunt, you know, she didn't believe it.
I mean, she kept insisting she could still hear the thing.
I mean, you could not tell her any different.
She started keeping an old umbrella, you know, by her chair.
Man, she would just bang on the floor and yell at it.
Even gave it a name.
It was Scrabble.
Yeah, that was it.
You know, "Scrabble, just knock it off."
She got like that toward the end.
Got obsessive about stuff. Just got mad about stuff.
We didn't know what was up.
It wasn't like her to be that way.
But it turned out that the cancer had spread to her brain...
...and that was why.
It metastasized.
But it was good that that was when we decided to take her to the doctor...
...because then we knew what was up.
You know, got her some treatment.
Meds, so she wasn't stressing all the time.
It was a lot better after that.
You know, she was a lot happier.
Where the hell is he?
I've been to my oncologist, Jesse...
...just last week.
I'm still in remission.
I'm healthy.
Okay, so good. Great.
Well...
...no end in sight.
That's great.
Well...
...I missed it.
There was some perfect moment and it passed me right by.
I had to have enough to leave them.
That was the whole point.
I mean, none of this...
None of this makes any sense if I didn't have enough.
But it had to be before she found out. Skyler.
It had to be before that.
Perfect moment for what?
To drop dead?
What, you saying you wanna die?
I'm saying I've lived too long.
I mean...
...you want them to actually miss you, you know?
You want their memories of you to be...
But she just won't...
She just won't understand.
I mean, no matter how well I explain it...
...these days, she just has this...
This...
I mean, I truly believe there exists some combination of words.
There must exist certain words in a certain specific order...
...that would explain all of this, but with her, I just...
I just can't ever seem to find them.
Mr. White, how about you just sit down?
You know, I was thinking maybe before the fugue state...
...but before the fugue state, I didn't have enough money.
So no, not then.
And plus, my daughter wasn't born yet.
It had to be after Holly was born.
Mr. White...
Definitely before the surgery.
Oh, Christ.
That damn second cell phone.
I mean, how could I possibly?
I know the moment.
It was the night Jane died.
Yeah, I...
I was at home and we needed diapers...
...and so I said I'd go, but it was just an excuse.
Actually, that was the night I brought you your money, remember?
Yeah, I remember.
But afterward, I stopped at a bar.
It was odd. I never do that, go to a bar alone.
I just walked in, sat down.
I never told you.
That you went to a bar?
No, I...
I sit down and this man, this stranger...
...he engages me in conversation.
He's a complete stranger.
But he turns out to be Jane's father, Donald Margolis.
What are you talking about?
Of course, I didn't know it at the time.
I mean, he was just some guy in a bar.
I didn't put it together until after the crash when he was all over the news.
Jane's dad.
I mean, think of the odds.
Once I tried to calculate them, but they're astronomical.
I mean, think of the odds of me going in, sitting down...
...that night in that bar next to that man.
What did you talk about?
Water on Mars.
Family.
What about family?
I told him that I had a daughter and he told me he had one too.
Then he said:
"Never give up on family."
And I didn't.
I took his advice.
The universe is random. It's not inevitable.
It's simple chaos.
It's subatomic particles in endless aimless collision.
That's what science teaches us.
But what is this saying?
What is it telling us when, on the very night that this man's daughter dies...
...it's me who's having a drink with him?
I mean, how can that be random?
Hey, come on. Hey, sit down.
No, no. No, it's...
No. No.
No, that was the moment.
That night.
I should never have left home.
Never gone to your house.
Maybe things would have...
Oh, thought I was...
I was at home watching TV.
It was some...
Some nature program about elephants.
And Skyler and Holly were in another room.
I could hear them on the baby monitor.
She was singing a lullaby.
If I had just lived right up to that moment...
...and not one second more...
...that would have been perfect.
He's not coming down.
Must be Thailand-hot up there.
That's why he likes it.
Thailand's hot, right?
Yeah.
Then that's why.
Oh, Jesus.
Hey, hey, wait. Here.
He's not coming down.
He's staying up there forever.
What are you...? What are you doing?
What do you think? I'm gonna get that bitch.
No, you're gonna break your neck.
Yeah, yeah. Just...
No, seriously, you're... This is a bad idea.
Damn it.
Jesse.
Just hold onto it.
Hold it still?
Jesse.
I'm sorry.
Sorry for what, being a lunatic?
I'm sorry about Jane.
Yeah.
Me too.
I mean...
...I'm very sorry.
It's not your fault.
It's not mine either.
It's no one's fault, not even hers.
You know, we are who we are, Mr. White.
You know, two junkies with a duffel bag full of cash.
Like you said, we both would've been dead within a week.
But I miss her, though.
God, I do.
Jesse.
Come down.
Wait. I'm so close.
Let it go.
We need to cook.
What about the contamination?
It's all contaminated.
All right, well...
...I definitely scared him.
Probably stay out of our way.
Yeah!
Somebody got got, yo!
Did you see that, Mr. Wh...?
Bins are packed?
Bins are packed.
How's the yield?
Two-oh-two and change.
You okay getting home?
Yeah. Better. Thanks.
MaÃ±ana, then.
Jesse, come here.
I couldn't chance saying it inside.
For all I know, the lab's wired for sound.
That half a pound I said we were off by.
Now, I'm not accusing you, but if...
You understand? And if they ever found out...
I didn't take shit.
I'm just saying that I won't be able to protect you.
Who's asking you to?
ï»¿1
Yo, I thought I was gonna see some, like, vaginas.
I didn't say she actually painted vaginas.
I said, some of her paintings looked like vaginas.
Seriously? Not even close.
Georgia O'Keeffe painted all kinds of stuff.
Everyday items, her surroundings.
Some of it evoked an erotic nature.
It's who she was.
Not like any vagina I ever saw.
This chick have medical issues?
This particular painting...
...is of a door.
Any other doors we can check out?
Like, real ones or?
You know, I don't get it.
Why would anyone paint a picture of a door...
...over and over again, like, dozens of times?
But it wasn't the same.
Yeah, it was.
It was the same subject, but different every time.
The light was different, her mood was different.
She saw something new every time she painted it.
And that's not psycho to you?
Well, then why should we do anything more than once?
Should I just smoke this one cigarette?
Maybe we should only have sex once, if it's the same thing.
Whoa, no.
Should we just watch one sunset?
Or live just one day?
It's new every time. Each time is a different experience.
Okay, fine.
I guess the cow skull pictures were cool, but a door?
I will say it again. A door.
Why not a door? Sometimes you get fixated on something...
...and you might not even get why.
You open yourself up and go with the flow...
...wherever the universe takes you.
Okay, so the universe took her to a door.
And she got all obsessed with it and just had to paint it 20 times...
...until it was perfect.
I wouldn't say that. Nothing's perfect.
Yeah? Well...
...I mean...
...some things.
That was so sweet, I think I threw up in my mouth a bit.
You can't admit, just for once, that I'm right.
Come on. That O'Keeffe lady kept trying over and over...
...until that stupid door was perfect.
No. That door was her home and she loved it.
To me, that's about making that feeling last.
All right, here we go. You ready?
Come on, give me a step. Give me one step.
Nope. Nope, that's it. Take me up.
You can do this, Hank.
Come on, it's supposed to hurt. Pain is weakness leaving your body.
Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.
If you can get your leg up, go for it.
Take me up.
Coffee break. We're gonna let you rest and then try again.
Never mind about your coffee break. Take me up. I'm done. I'm done.
We'll just pick up where we left off.
Come on, Hank.
You can do it. How else are you gonna get out of here?
Don't you have any friends? I mean, Jesus, find something to do.
I don't need everyone staring at me hanging here like a camel's ball sack.
Hank, he just wants to be supportive.
It's all right.
I'll be right back, okay? Be right back.
Gonna get me out of here sometime today?
Sky?
We got our first bill, and, you know, if you're still insistent...
I am.
Prepare yourself.
They're gonna start coming in weekly like that, so...
You're sure you can do this?
Yeah.
I'll do that.
What the hell, man?
What, I can't work a scale now?
This is bullshit. Just say it.
Just say the words.
You think I'm stealing.
Walk with who you are.
That was the phrase my sponsor used to use with me...
...back when I first started coming to meetings.
It's probably just a different way of saying be yourself, right?
But this idea of "walk" also tells me...
...that I have to move forward. Always good advice, at least for me.
I see we have some new people here at Group, a couple new faces.
See some hands? First time?
Great. Welcome.
Maybe we can go around, introduce ourselves.
Say whatever's on your mind.
How about you? You wanna start us off?
Yeah. My name is Andrea...
We don't bite. No judgments.
You can be as open and honest as you wanna be.
Honestly? I don't wanna be here.
All right, fair enough. Who else had their hand up?
Hey, what's up?
My name's Jesse.
Well, hello. My name's Brandon.
And this is, I believe, Peter?
Right, I'm Peter. How are you?
Look, I just wanted to give you a heads up.
It's gonna get slower smuggling product...
...with Grandpa Anus watching every move I make.
But don't worry, I'll keep it flowing.
Great, right on.
Yeah.
So how's it selling?
Mad volume?
Yeah, it's...
You know, it's...
It's not so good.
What do you mean? How much have you sold?
I sold a teenth.
One teenth? That's it?
Yeah.
To who?
To him.
It's not easy selling to these people. They're trying to better themselves.
Yeah, there's, like, positivity and stuff going on here.
I'm out risking my ass to get product for you two...
...and you're too pussy to sell?
You're pathetic.
You know what? I want it back. All of it.
I'll sell it myself.
Come on, man. Don't be like that.
Selling to these people, it's like shooting a baby in the face.
It's not so easy like you think.
I will show you exactly how easy it is.
Thank you.
All right.
See you next week.
Oh, hey, sorry.
No, go ahead.
Andrea, right?
Yeah.
Hey, my name's Jesse...
...and I don't really wanna be here either.
Sorry.
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?
No.
Your dad is.
How'd you get her to sleep so quick?
Are you that boring?
I'm comforting.
I'm a comforting presence.
Hey, so check it out.
See what that means?
Check out the date.
Next Thursday is officially six months that I've had my learner's.
Which means I can get my provisional and start driving by myself.
You don't turn 16 for two more months.
It doesn't matter, it's a provisional.
Look it up. They changed the law like, 10 years ago.
Yeah, well, I didn't vote for that.
Doesn't matter if you voted for it, it's the law.
So both of you start thinking about what kind of car you wanna buy me.
I think I'd be good with either an old IROC or a 'Stang.
A 'Stang.
How about something with playing cards in the spokes?
Makes a nice motory sound, you know?
Dad, you're not gonna get off that easy.
Well, I think that this is...
We should probably table this discussion for later.
Your dad and I have a couple things we need to talk about, so...
Okay.
A 1971 Mach 1 fastback...
...in Grabber Lime with a shaker hood.
'Stang.
I'll write that down so we don't forget. Oh, darn it, no pencil.
What is "Ice Station Zebra Associates"?
It's a loan out, it's fine.
Whose loan out?
It's fine. Really.
I...
...have a guy.
Okay.
Does your guy know the tax code and regulations in New Mexico?
There's very specific paperwork that has to be submitted quarterly on this.
Yes. My guy is a top...
...guy.
Who is he?
What's his name? What are his qualifications?
Walt, this money has to be unimpeachable...
...when it reaches Hank and Marie.
And it is. It will be.
But how do I know that? I mean, you can't even tell me the man's name.
Jesus, Skyler, do you really wanna know?
Do you really wanna know?
Really?
What a pleasure it is to have you.
I'm gonna call you Skyler, if that's okay. It's a lovely name.
Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.
Walt never told me how lucky he was... Prior to recent unfortunate events.
His taste in women is the same as his taste in lawyers...
...only the very best with just the right amount of dirty.
That's a joke. That's a joke.
It's funny because you are so clearly very classy.
Here, please, sit down.
So Walt tells me that you have some concerns I can alleviate.
Yes, I do. I have...
...concerns.
If we're going to go down this road...
...and clearly we are for the sake of my brother-in-law...
I've heard about him. He's an American hero.
At any rate, I need some assurances that we're gonna go about this...
...in a manner that is extremely safe and cautious.
Fair enough. I'll walk you through the process.
First step is something we like to call money laundering, all right?
Take your money, represented by, say, these jelly beans...
You know, I'm a bookkeeper, so I actually...
I know what money laundering is.
Well.
Yeah.
And as with most things, the devil is in the details.
So to begin with, what are we saying is the source of this money?
That's simple.
Walt here, actually came up with a great story about gambling winnings.
Blackjack, right? Some card-counting system?
Well, actually that was Skyler's idea.
Well, you grow more gorgeous by the minute.
There you have it.
I'll generate false Currency Transaction Reports out the wazoo...
...as well as the necessary W-2Gs. I know a couple casino managers...
...who will jump at the chance to report false losses.
It's a win-win for everyone.
Yeah, but you can't sell that for very long...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way ahead of you.
We declare just enough not to arouse suspicion...
...then Walt's onetime winnings become seed money for an investment.
Investment in what?
Drum roll, please. Wait for it.
Laser tag.
Laser tag. Seven thousand square feet of rollicking fun...
...in the heart of northern Bernalillo County.
Laser tag?
Yeah, there's guns and glow lights, and kids wear the vests...
Yeah, no, no. I actually... I know what it is.
It's just that in relation to Walt, it's...
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
Makes more sense than you two being together.
Do you even know Walt? I mean, how would he, of all people...
...buy a laser tag business? It doesn't add up.
It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist, scientists love lasers.
Plus, they got bumper boats, so...
"Hey, everybody...
...Walt suddenly decided to invest in laser tag. Just out of the blue."
Really? That's what we're supposed to tell people, our family, our friends...
...the government?
Let me bottom line this for you. You don't need to be involved, okay?
I've been doing this for a lot of years...
...successfully, believe it or not, without your help.
So thank you for stopping by.
You want a beer or something?
Or something?
What do you mean?
Like, beer.
I'm cleaned out of anything else.
Even if I wasn't, we're not supposed to.
Yeah.
I've heard it over and over and over again.
You know, don't you think it's ridiculous...
...that society says beer is okay...
...and a little hit of something sweet is wrong?
I mean, what's the point of shutting yourself off completely...
...from something that lifts you off the ground?
I spend so much energy fighting the urge not to use...
...and I feel like crap because of it.
I know, it's just...
What?
I can't get caught using again.
See, the thing is...
...not to get caught.
You ever try that blue stuff that's going around?
Just a little gas in the tank...
...and suddenly everything is interesting.
Man, I wish I could make that feeling last.
Like I said, I got nothing here.
What if I could get some?
Mommy, Mommy.
Hey, baby.
Your nana brought you home early.
Grandma, I thought you were keeping Brock today?
I was, then I saw your car.
I thought you had a meeting.
I did, but we changed the time.
Grandma, this is Jesse. He's from the meeting.
He's like a sponsor. Jesse, this is Grandma.
Jesse, this is Brock.
So you have a kid, huh?
What's up?
Brock, huh?
That's a cool name.
Here, give it up.
Brock is almost 6. You okay, with kids?
What? Yeah. Yeah, he's cool.
Okay, Brock is gonna go play in his room while the big people talk.
He's gonna go play with his Legos and his cars.
Say, "Bye, Jesse."
Bye, Jesse.
Hope you had a good time at Grandma's.
Oh, I fixed your blue car, do you remember?
The convertible one?
You can jump on your bed. Play with your toys.
Safe and cautious, that's all I'm asking, and that man...
...is neither.
I'll admit he comes across like a circus clown...
...but he knows what he's doing.
And safe and cautious is you not being involved in this at all.
Well, it's a little late on that.
This is what happens when you decide to pay our bills with drug money.
Skyler...
...this isn't just about what happened before.
My involvement in this is ongoing.
Understand?
I can't just quit.
I have something of a contract.
But it's all very safe, professional.
Structured.
Like, I can't simply quit.
Where you going?
If you're gonna launder money, Walt...
...at least do it right.
You worked here four years.
It's a business you understand.
It's a story people will believe.
Not laser tag, this.
This is what we buy.
You.
This is what you buy.
Yeah, I mean, there's free doughnuts. Nothing's wrong with a free doughnut.
Hey, Jesse, right?
Brandon, Peter. How goes it? Hanging in there?
Can we please, just?
Dumb-ass.
Sorry, man. I was trying to keep it on the DL.
So you and that girl, do the deed yet?
Do what?
You know, sell to her?
What are you two even doing here?
What do you mean?
You can't get your nut up to sell, what's the point of even coming?
Homey, I'm on, like, step five.
Deuce, yo. I'm catching up.
Whatever. Later.
Hey.
Dude needs to come into the fold.
Yup.
Hey, you know what? I have magical powers.
You wanna see?
Ready?
That's not real.
It is real. All right, do you wanna see something real?
Look at this. Watch this.
Ready?
You like that?
That's science and stuff, makes it do that.
Do it again.
Let Jesse eat his dinner, Brock.
Oh, it's okay. It's okay. Wanna see it again?
Could you do a trick with firecrackers?
Firecrackers?
You know, I don't have any firecrackers on me.
Who does tricks with firecrackers?
Tomas.
Tomas does tricks with firecrackers, huh? Who's Tomas?
He's my kid brother.
Yeah?
And we don't talk about him.
Come on, eat your food, Brock.
Can I have a chip? I'm gonna steal your chip.
Hey, that's mine.
That's it? That's what you wanna buy?
People will believe it, at least.
I worked here for four years.
"Wax on, wax off," was that you?
Hey, how come you guys always give air freshener?
I explicitly say, "No air freshener"...
...and every time, I drive away smelling like an Alpine whorehouse.
All due respect, I don't see it. So I vote no.
It makes a better story than your laser tag.
Is that you talking or Yoko Ono?
She has a point. It makes more sense that I invest right here.
Based on her years of experience in money laundering, I suppose.
If you're committed enough, you can make any story work.
I once convinced a woman that I was Kevin Costner...
...and it worked because I believed it, all right?
Has nothing to do with the story.
Besides, this dump isn't gonna work because it doesn't have a Danny.
There's no Danny here.
What in God's name is a Danny?
Danny runs the laser tag. Danny is the guy who had a vision.
Where others saw a dirt lot, he saw black lights, rubber aliens...
...teenagers running around with ray guns, right?
Like Bugsy Siegel in the desert.
When the stock market took a shit and Danny got into trouble...
...he went searching for exactly the type of situation we're offering.
Danny will look the other way to keep his dream afloat.
In other words, Danny can be trusted completely.
That guy, the guy with the eyebrows that won't quit, is he a Danny?
You buy this place, all you got is a big building that squirts water.
You got no Danny here.
You wanna stay for dinner?
Yeah.
Thanks.
What time is it?
Early still.
So...
What?
Thought maybe if you're holding, we can do something.
What?
You know, that blue stuff you were talking about.
Maybe you had a line on some?
Wait.
What?
Thought you said the kid is coming home.
Yeah, in a few hours.
And you seriously wanna get high?
I don't know what you're getting pissed about.
You're the one who brought it up.
Yeah, that was before I found out you got a kid.
What kind of mother are you?
What?
You heard me. What kind of mom gets wasted with a kid to take care of?
Nobody can say I don't take care of my son.
You come in my house and judge me?
Like you got no responsibilities so it's okay for you?
What do you know about me?
I take care of my baby. I'll do anything for him.
The day Brock was born, I swore...
...I won't let what happened to Tomas, happen to my son.
I'll die first.
Sorry. I...
I just...
Look, I'll get out of here if you want.
That's what you wanna do, then go.
It's not what I want.
Look, I was out of line talking about that stuff.
We both were.
You're right...
...I don't know what you've been through.
You can tell me if you want.
This whole neighborhood's run by gangs.
They run the drugs, control the streets.
They sort of took Tomas in.
No dad around.
Eight years old...
...they got Tomas slinging.
Part of some crew.
Then when he was 10...
...for some initiation or something...
...they made him kill somebody.
I heard the rumors. I didn't believe it at first.
But then I saw him like a week later.
And he told me, yeah, he did it.
They gave Tomas a gun.
Gave him a choice.
Him or some dude.
So he did it.
Told me all about it like it was nothing.
Who did he say he killed?
Some dealer.
From some outside crew.
Right around the corner from here, over off of Central.
Just rode up on his bike and shot him.
Off of Central?
Like over by the train tracks?
When was this?
Few months back.
What else did he tell you?
He shot the guy right through the neck.
Shot him dead.
Just because he was working the wrong corner.
It won't happen again.
Not to my son.
Guess what.
People who say "guess what" and then actually expect you to guess...
...I hate those people.
Well, I just heard...
...about a certain patient named Schrader-comma-Hank...
...who is going to be released at the end of this week.
Isn't that fantastic?
They plan on rolling me out the front door?
Or put me on a greased plank and slide me out the window?
Hey.
I don't care what any damned insurance company thinks.
I'm not leaving here till I'm well.
Hank, this isn't about insurance.
I've talked to everybody, they all say you are healthy enough to go home.
I'm healthy enough, huh? Yeah.
Hank, you get stronger every day.
You don't need to be in a hospital.
In this condition, yeah, I do.
You'll be just as comfortable at home as you are here.
You'll have all the same equipment.
Same equipment? What's that mean?
The equipment that you have here, that you need. Short-term.
You'll do your PT at home and it'll be great...
...because you'll be home.
Wait till you see the bedroom. I had them move the plasma in.
I know that's how you always wanted it.
You only had to get shot to get it, right?
I got you a new bed...
A hospital bed?
Well...
You put a hospital bed in my bedroom?
Hank...
...you'll be home.
You get that out of my house.
You hear me, Marie?
Today.
Hank...
I leave this hospital...
...when I walk out of here. You understand?
And not before.
What's a Danny?
Danny's an accomplice.
Someone who's in on the scheme, who knows about laundering...
...who's paid to look the other way.
Now, while I agree with you that laser tag is a hard sell...
...without a Danny, the car wash isn't really an option.
And he can't get you another Danny to run the car wash?
Easier said than done.
If we're looking for someone trustworthy.
What about me?
What about you?
Me.
I'll be the Danny.
No. No, no, Skyler, that is not a good idea.
I'm capable of managing a small business.
A legal business, not this.
Who else could we trust?
No.
Walt...
...I'm in this.
And if I'm in it, I'm gonna do it right.
No.
You are not in this. You are not...
We're married, how am I not in this?
We are not married, Skyler, we're divorced.
Right?
I never actually got around to filing the papers.
Married couples can't be compelled to testify against one another.
So there's that.
Jesse. Jesse.
Respirator.
Right.
Yes?
Yes, all right. Okay.
Yeah, I'll be there.
What was that?
An invitation.
Walter, you're right on time.
Please, come in.
I hope you like paila marina.
It's a fancy name for fish stew.
It sounds like a clichÃ©, but indeed, it's just like my mother used to make it.
Come on. You can help me cook.
This is a Chilean dish that I love...
...but I never get to make it.
Kids won't eat it.
But...
...you know how that is.
Sure.
Do you mind?
Would you slice the garlic?
Very thin.
Why did you invite me here?
We're working together...
...why not break bread together?
Now, the garlic?
It always amazes me the way the senses work in connection to memory.
I mean, this stew is simply an amalgam of ingredients.
Taken separately, these ingredients alone don't remind me of anything.
I mean, not very much at all.
But in this precise combination, the smell of this meal...
...instantly, it brings you back to my childhood.
How is that possible?
Basically, it takes place in the hippocampus.
Neural connections are formed.
The senses make the neurons express signals...
...that go right back to the same part of the brain as before.
Where memory is stored.
It's something called relational memory.
Don't quote me on that, I'm...
I'm rusty on my biology.
That's very interesting.
Walter...
...I would like to help you, if I could.
Help me how?
Well, when I first started out, I made a lot of mistakes.
More than I care to admit.
I wish I'd had someone to advise me...
...because this life of ours...
...it can overwhelm.
You are a wealthy man now.
And one must learn to be rich.
To be poor, anyone can manage.
What advice do you have for me?
Never make the same mistake twice.
Hey.
What's up?
You? You Tomas?
I heard you were the man.
Yeah, what you want?
Crystal.
You think you could hook me up?
Three hundred.
For a teenth?
Shit, come on, yo.
Three hundred.
Hey, what's up?
Hey, yo.
Bounce.
ï»¿1
Hey, guys.
So if it's okay, I was thinking about using this one for the test.
Mom's brakes are very sticky...
...and you barely press down on them and it's like a screech.
Sure.
But I'm good?
Yeah, you're great. Why?
Are my feet okay?
I looked it up. New Mexico says all I need is a note from a doctor.
I know it's not the right way and all...
...but once I get my provisional, I can keep working at it.
Well, as long as it gets you safely from point A to point B...
...then who am I to argue?
Hi.
You're a sweet girl. Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
I know.
Here you go.
Here you go.
All right.
Thank you.
Got it?
Yeah.
Okay. All right.
So 9 a.m. Saturday?
Yes, 9 a.m. Saturday.
So which means pick me up about 8:30?
I'll be here with bells on.
What?
It's just a saying. Don't worry, I won't be wearing bells.
Hey.
Hey, Mom.
Hi. Do you have a minute?
Yeah.
Could you keep an eye on your sister?
Sure.
Thanks.
See you, Dad.
Bye, son. Hey, good work today.
Thank you.
Have you thought any more about what we discussed?
"Thought any more" meaning reconsidered? No.
So show me the flaw in it.
Flaws, Skyler. Flaws. Plural, not singular.
Where do you want me to start?
Hey, I don't love this situation, all right, that you put me in.
However, let's just stick with what makes sense here.
You took the money you won gambling...
...invested it in the car wash you helped run.
You hired your wife as a bookkeeper, because she's actually a bookkeeper.
That is a story an auditor can believe. What am I missing?
You should just take this money that I give you...
...and not look too closely at it.
So if, God forbid, I get caught...
...you maintain plausible deniability.
Okay, my estranged husband who, when he was working...
...made $43,000 a year, starts shoveling money at me.
And when the police come, I'm supposed to say:
"I never thought about it, officers. Made sense to me." Really?
That, in your mind, is plausible deniability?
I tell you what, Walt...
...I'd rather have them think I'm Bonnie what's-her-name...
...than some complete idiot.
So you're promoting caution here.
And you want a believable story.
That, it seems to me, is the safest way...
...to make the best out of a very bad situation, yes.
But I'm noting a little hole in your plot though.
Why would your estranged husband be doing all this for you?
Because he loves his family and desperately wants a reconciliation...
...though it may be hopeless and futile.
Then again, he'd try anything.
I'm just not buying it. No, I think it would be better...
...if the husband were no longer estranged.
Yeah. Maybe if he were back sleeping in his own bed.
It's suddenly a fantasy story.
I am at least gonna be a part of this household.
Dinner with the family every night of the week.
Not every night, no.
Six nights a week. One night off.
Dinner two nights. Not weekends.
With 24 hours' notice.
Five nights a week, with no notice.
Three. Six hours' notice.
Five nights a week, two hours' notice.
Four.
Don't push it.
And I want my own key to the house.
No.
For emergencies and appearances, yes.
I am going to babysit my own daughter, help my son with his homework.
I am going to be a part of this family. That is how we'll sell your little fiction.
How about we stop somewhere afterward and get a beer?
No. Thanks, though. Maybe some other time.
Seriously.
Get a beer with me.
What?
What the hell are you doing?
That's ours, right?
Look at it and tell me if that's ours.
Yes, it's ours. Now put it away.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Where did you get that? Did you take it from the lab?
I bought it from the two guys who killed Combo.
They had Combo shot down in the street...
...and now it's our product they're selling.
Which means they work for our guy. Right?
What? No. What is that? That's hearsay. Do you have any proof?
I heard it from the sister of the kid who shot him.
Hear how I just said "kid"?
This kid, he's 11 years old.
Shot Combo on orders.
These two scumbags, they got him dealing.
They got him...
And you know he's not the first.
They use kids because hey, why not? Easy to control. Easy to fool.
All they get is juvie if they get caught.
Hearts and minds, right?
Get them young and they're yours forever.
These guys killed Combo.
They used this little kid like some puppet.
They used him to shoot my friend.
So why are you telling me this?
I need your help.
How?
I need ricin.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Look, these two...
Hey.
No.
Hey, they gotta go. All right? I got the entire thing figured out.
No.
The delivery method, everything.
All I need from you is the poison, that's all.
No...
Look.
Otherwise, you don't gotta lift a finger.
No.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Not even...
Look, you don't get how right this is?
You don't get how the whole entire world would be better off?
We're not talking about this.
I know a woman who buys from these two once or twice a week.
They sit in their car all day and they get hungry, so she brings them food...
...and they knock a few bucks off her price.
There's your delivery system right there.
I could be a mile away.
Jesus.
A meth-head you're trusting to do this?
Know what? That meth-head stood up to your brother-in-law.
He questioned her for five hours. She didn't give it up.
Know how you know? Because you're not in prison right now.
Well, I know I would be in prison after this.
Prison or worse. And I'd be right alongside you.
No, Jesse, you cannot be serious.
This is a ridiculous idea.
It's ridiculous? What, so you're saying it's not gonna work?
How about back when it was your plan?
When we were gonna use it on Tuco.
Apples and oranges.
Guy eats ricin...
...two or three days later he gets the flu or a heart attack and he keels over.
That's what you said. Untraceable back to us.
To me.
Not even that other scumbag we work for is ever gonna figure it out.
It was a good plan back when it was Tuco, and it's a good plan now.
Tuco wanted to murder us. These guys don't.
Apples and oranges. Do I really have to sit here and explain the difference?
Combo was us, man.
He was one of us. Does that mean nothing?
Why didn't you go after these guys two or three months ago?
Because I just found out about them.
What's to find out?
It's a dispute over turf, right?
I mean, how hard could it have been for you to track them down on their turf...
...and kill them months ago?
Because back then, you were too busy getting high, feeling sorry.
Now, murder...
...is not part of your 12-step program.
This is not some amends that you have to make.
What you are talking about here is pointless.
This achieves nothing.
It accomplishes nothing.
If you don't see what it accomplishes...
...then there's no way I can explain it to you.
Jesse, listen to me.
You are not a murderer.
I'm not, and you're not.
It's as simple as that.
Jesse.
I'm doing it.
With or without you.
Knock, knock.
Chrissakes, Marie, you don't say "knock, knock," you... like that.
I like saying it.
Well, that's not the rules.
Okay?
You knock your way, I'll knock mine.
But look, see? I win.
Not so fast.
Christ, again? That's three in a row.
Got a fricking Paul Newman over here?
Been playing cards with your dad?
No. Why?
How is your old man?
Back teaching?
No. I don't think either of them are working...
...right now.
How they swinging that?
I don't know.
Hey...
...did you know the doctors told your Uncle Hank...
...he can get out of here anytime he wants?
Oh, yeah? That's great.
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.
Why not?
What? That's what they said.
Because they want the room.
They hit the sheets with Lysol, reset the meter...
...and wheel the next slob in. We went over this, Marie. Drop it.
Are you not well enough?
Jesus, kid, you too? Do I look well enough?
I'm shitting in pans, peeing in pitchers.
I can't move my legs. Got it?
So people in wheelchairs should be in hospitals?
What about people on crutches? Maybe I should be in here too.
Is that what you're trying to say?
Exactly. Deal, you little prick.
Bitch.
You know I'm hourly, right?
He promised me that he would be here.
Oh, he promised.
Why didn't you tell me? Let's wait then. That's a joke. The kid ain't coming.
Okay, so, what's plan B?
I don't know.
I really don't.
Well, let's brainstorm.
You really think he's serious?
That's why I'm here, Saul.
The way he was talking, he is going to do it. Or try, at least.
Okay, so we pay him off.
No, no, it's not about money. It's about getting him off the streets.
Getting him to calm down.
Maybe...
What if we, maybe?
Could you get him arrested?
You want your criminal associate taken into police custody?
No, now listen. I know it sounds risky.
But it wouldn't anything that would get him into real trouble...
...and nothing that could lead back to our business.
Just some minor offense.
Pinkman in jail? I don't know. I'm picturing it and...
No, not jail as in "jail" jail.
I'm talking about one of those situations...
...where you're in an orange jumpsuit picking up litter along the highway.
That's jail.
You're talking about a level-two joint.
Something that keeps him off the street for 30 days.
Then by the time he gets out...
...tempers have cooled and hopefully we can move on.
Well, Roswell Correctional's pretty low impact, you know.
In the past, I've recommended Springer...
...but I'm hearing chancy things about their bathrooms since they renovated.
So...
So it's possible, right?
Well, it falls under my Premium Services Package...
...but you can afford that. I'll call my PI.
You understand what you have to do?
And you can never talk to anyone, right?
I mean, ever. Understand?
Yeah.
I found this stuff on the Internet.
Takes days to kick in.
Just keep quiet and this won't ever come back to you.
You okay with this, right?
Just think of it like it's the same thing as always.
You're just delivering some hamburgers.
It's not just delivering hamburgers.
Hey. You got a kid, right?
What's his name?
Patrick.
All right, imagine these two guys had Patrick working as a mule.
Making him kill people.
Wouldn't you do anything to protect your kid?
Of course I would. I do all kinds of things for him.
Okay, so...
...these guys are using kids like that.
They gotta go. Right?
Good.
Tomorrow.
I'll be in touch.
Yeah. I bet that tastes good, huh?
Hey.
Come here, baby.
Okay. Here we go.
Here we go.
What are you doing? If you need to talk, use the phone.
This isn't a phone talk, Walter.
Your wife's out, right?
Isn't she something?
I got a granddaughter a few years older.
What can I do for you?
Have a seat, Walter.
I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman and this plan of yours.
And?
Well, I'm not gonna do it.
Why?
Because it's moronic.
Saul said you've done things like this before.
That's not the moronic part.
Okay. So, what's the problem?
The problem is the boss wouldn't like it.
Saul?
My boss.
Your boss.
This is a professional courtesy. No one knows I'm here. Understand?
But our employer would find out, like always.
And if Pinkman were arrested, he'd take it as a problem.
Walt...
...you got a good thing going here. We all do.
You wanna risk it all on one junkie?
Now, I realize you two have a history...
...but this kid's been on the bubble a while now. It's a long time coming.
What is?
I used to be a beat cop, a long time ago.
I'd get called on domestic disputes all the time.
Hundreds, probably, over the years.
But there was this one guy, this one piece of shit that I will never forget.
Gordie. He looked like Bo Svenson. You remember him?
Walking Tall? You don't remember?
No.
Anyway, big boy, 270, 280...
...but his wife... Or whatever she was... His lady...
...was real small. Like a bird.
Wrists like little branches.
Anyway, my partner and I'd get called out there every weekend...
...and one of us would pull her aside and say:
"Come on, tonight's the night we press charges."
This wasn't one of those "deep down, he loves me" setups.
We got a lot of those, but not this. This girl was scared.
She wasn't gonna cross him. No way, no how.
Nothing we could do but pass her to the EMT's, put him a car...
...drive him downtown, throw him in a drunk tank.
He sleeps it off, next morning, out he goes.
Back home.
But one night...
...my partner's out sick, and it's just me.
The call comes in and it's the usual crap.
Broke her nose in the shower kind of thing.
So I cuff him, put him in the car and away we go.
Only that night...
...we're driving into town...
...and this sideways asshole is in my back seat humming "Danny Boy."
And it just rubbed me wrong.
So instead of left, I go right, out into nowhere.
And I kneel him down and I put my revolver in his mouth...
...and I told him, "This is it. This is how it ends."
And he's crying, going to the bathroom all over himself.
Swearing to God he's gonna leave her alone.
Screaming, much as you can with a gun in your mouth.
And I told him to be quiet.
That I needed to think about what I was gonna do here.
And, of course, he got quiet...
...goes still and real quiet.
Like a dog waiting for dinner scraps.
Then we just stood there for a while.
Me, acting like I'm thinking things over...
...and Prince Charming kneeling in the dirt with shit in his pants.
And after a few minutes, I took the gun out of his mouth...
...and I say, "So help me, if you ever touch her again...
...I will such and such and such, and blah, blah, blah."
It was just a warning?
Of course.
Just trying to do the right thing.
But two weeks later he killed her.
Of course.
Caved her head in with the base of a Waring blender.
We got there, there was so much blood, you could taste the metal.
Moral of the story is...
...I chose a half measure...
...when I should have gone all the way.
I'll never make that mistake again.
No more half measures, Walter.
Man, I don't get this.
I don't get this at all. All I'm seeing is the kid.
So where are they?
I don't know. They're always around.
Burgers are getting cold.
So is it, like, fast?
Don't sweat it. You're just doing what you do.
Hey, nobody's gonna know anything.
Can I have another bump?
Look, you had your bump.
Get this thing done, then you can have all you want.
Gonna need you to come with me.
Take a walk.
Where we going?
Sit down.
I understand that you have a problem with two of my employees.
It is true that they killed one of your associates.
It is possible they acted rashly.
But, on the other hand, there was provocation.
The man was selling on their territory.
There is blame on both sides.
This will go no further.
It will be settled right here, right now.
You told him?
Wait outside.
Listen to me. You have one friend in this room. This man.
Those men outside are my trusted employees.
And when I learned what you intended to do...
If it wasn't for this man and the respect I have for him...
...I would be dealing with this in a very different way.
You don't look at him. You look at me.
This is what happens now. My men will come back inside...
...and you will shake their hands and you will make peace.
And that will be the end of this.
No.
Jesse.
Pardon me?
They use kids.
These assholes got an 11 -year-old kid doing their killing for them.
You're supposed to be some kind of a reasonable businessman.
This how you do business?
You okay with this? You got anything to say here?
Bring them back.
No more children.
Understand?
And you...
...you keep the peace.
Say it.
Yeah. I'll keep the peace.
Shake hands.
Jesse, your actions...
...they affect other people.
Sometimes compromises have to be made...
...for the best of reasons.
Jesse. Jesse.
Marie, let the people who get paid to do this do this.
The people who get paid to do this do a lousy job.
So I guess this is what you want, huh?
Just lying in a hospital bed getting sponge baths from nurses.
Marie.
It's time to go home, Hank.
How many times I gotta tell you, Marie? Not till I'm well.
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?
I'm just seeing.
Seeing what?
Seeing what I see.
I'm not at my best here, Marie.
We'll see.
Nothing's gonna happen.
I say it will.
No. I'm in this bed for a reason.
It's a waste of time.
Besides, what if someone comes in?
I don't care if someone walks in.
What's wrong with you?
I'll tell you what. If I can get the groundhog to see his shadow...
Not gonna happen. I'm sorry.
I'm betting it will. And if he does, you check out of here.
I'm not gonna bet on whether I can get a boner.
No bet. There's no bet here. No bet.
Afraid you'll lose?
You know, you're just... You're just being foolish, you know?
Come on. What's the point?
The point is you're not completely hopeless.
We have a bet?
You know what?
If it'll get you out of here quicker. You got one minute.
One minute?
Yeah.
All right. That's a cakewalk.
You know, this is just...
This is just sad. I mean...
I really feel sorry for you, Marie, you know? I really do. It's just...
It's pathetic.
That's good, keep talking.
Protest. Struggle.
Marie, give up. I mean, seriously, it's...
...not...
...gonna happen.
Bad day?
I don't even know.
Anyway...
...it's better now.
Tell them you're busy.
Hello?
Grandma?
Slow down.
Slow down, I can't...
Oh, God.
Tomas!
No.
You have to let me in. Please.
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.
Jesse, you are now 42 minutes late.
I'm starting without you.
What is "wasabi"?
Wasabi. Right you are.
Four-letter word, 1200.
Pilots and musicians know this word derives from...
Dinner's almost ready, okay?
Okay.
What is "solo"?
This guy's good.
Four letter word, 2000.
"A loud, harsh cry, Walt Whitman's was barbaric."
"Yell."
What is "yawp"?
Kevin.
What is "yawp"?
Yawp.
Tokyo, 1200.
This crustacean...
What the heck's a yawp?
A yawp is a yell. I'll be right back.
That's what I said.
Okay to use your bathroom, right?
Yeah, okay.
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.
Look, I hope you're not waiting for an apology because I did not rat you out.
I was looking out for your best interests, as well as my own.
And I stand by my decision 100 percent...
...so we'll just have to agree to disagree.
Anyway, just call me back.
So the TV turns itself off, huh?
Yeah.
I'll get it.
The beginning of an early cold snap. But first, more details on...
Where's the remote?
The murder of a young boy in the South Valley.
Police have yet to release a statement...
...but sources indicate that 11 -year-old Tomas Cantillo...
...may have been the victim of a gang-related execution.
An anonymous tip brought police to a playground...
...in the 4700 block of Eighth Avenue late last night.
Paramedics were called to the scene but were unable to revive the boy.
A gruesome crime...
Can you turn that off?
Yet another casualty in what appears to be...
...the city's ongoing struggle...
Walt?
...against drugs and the gangs that peddle them. We'll be passing...
Hand me your dad...
I'm sorry, it's just they've been talking about that all day, and it's just...
No. Yeah.
Hey, did you know your dad and I...
...are thinking about starting a business together?
Seriously?
What kind of business?
We're thinking maybe a car wash.
What do you mean? Like the?
I'm sorry, I have to go.
Oh, my God.
Run.
ï»¿1
Well, hello again.
Hi, I hope we're not too late.
No, no. Perfect timing.
Okay.
Stan, this is my husband, Walt.
Hi.
Good to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Sandia Laboratories, huh?
Yeah.
I hear some fascinating stuff goes on out there.
Yeah, well, you know.
Working on anything you can talk about?
I'm picturing giant space lasers. Am I right?
Honestly, what I do would bore you senseless.
Giant space lasers? That sounds cool. I'll bring it up at our next staff meeting.
Well, just remember I get a cut.
All right. It's a deal.
So this is it, honey. What do you say? Wanna take a tour?
Sure.
Okay.
Look, how about I give ya'll some privacy?
I'll go out to the car, make a few calls. Take as much time as you need.
All right.
Okay, thanks.
He's a nice guy. He doesn't push.
Yeah.
So as you can see, there's this kind of flow going on here.
It's a nice big living room.
Yeah.
And this is the dining area.
Oh, the dining area. Right.
Yes. Oh, and...
...it's got a pool.
Pool is nice.
Backyard could be a little bigger.
And... Oh, there's a breakfast bar kind of dealie here, which is nice.
And, I don't know, the kitchen's really spacious...
...and, you know, got good appliances and...
How many bedrooms?
Three. Told you.
They're all pretty good size and... Oh, this is the first one here.
And then there's two more at the back.
Only three bedrooms?
We're gonna need at least five, don't you think?
Five?
Yeah.
What, do I look like I'm about to drop a litter?
No, no, no. We'll have three kids total, eventually.
Yeah, but we'll need a spare room for a study...
...so that I can work at home and you can write.
Yeah, no. I don't think this is gonna be enough.
Okay, what about a wine cellar?
I mean, we certainly cannot be expected to live without a wine cellar.
Very funny. I just think we need to set our sights high is all.
At least, higher than here.
Walt, this is a good neighborhood.
It's got a good elementary and a very good high school...
...and believe me, because I have definitely looked everywhere.
For our price range, this is as good as it gets.
Well, then let's stretch our price range.
Truly. I mean, why?
Why buy a starter house when we'll have to move out in a year or two?
Did you win the lottery and not tell me?
I'm serious.
Come on. Why be cautious?
We've got nowhere to go but up.
Yeah.
Walter, you see us?
Yeah. I see you.
I'd like you to exit your vehicle and start walking toward us.
And then what? I'm gonna need some...
Some kind of assurance.
I assure you, I could kill you from way over here...
...if it makes you feel any better.
Walter, you've been busy.
You wanna put your arms out to your sides for me, if you would?
You know I haven't slept since Thursday?
I was out all night cleaning up after you.
I need my sleep.
You said no half measures.
Yeah. Funny how words can be so open to interpretation.
You get your car fixed?
Not yet.
You're gonna wanna get your car fixed.
Let's see how this goes first.
Has your condition worsened?
Excuse me?
Your medical condition.
Has it grown worse?
Not that I know of, no.
Is there a ringing in your ears?
Are you seeing bright lights or hearing voices?
I'm quite well, thank you.
No. Clearly, you are not.
No rational person would do as you have done.
Explain yourself.
My partner was about to get himself shot.
I intervened.
Some worthless junkie.
For him, you intervene and put us all at risk.
Some contemptible junkie who couldn't keep the peace for eight hours.
That's right. He couldn't.
He was angry because those dealers of yours...
...had just murdered an 11 -year-old boy.
I heard about it.
He should have let me take care of them.
Maybe.
Then again, maybe he thought it was you who gave the order.
Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child?
I would never ask you that.
Where is Pinkman now?
I wouldn't know.
Couple of time zones away, at least.
Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.
He has enough money to last forever, he knows he needs to keep moving.
You'll never find him.
I don't know, Walt...
...it's what I do, after all.
He's out of the picture.
I saved his life, I owed him that, but now he and I are done.
Which is exactly what you wanted, isn't it?
You've always struck me as a very pragmatic man.
So if I may, I would like to review options with you.
Of which, it seems to me, you have two.
Option A:
You kill me right here and now.
Apparently, I have made that very easy for you.
You can kill me, no witnesses...
...and then spend the next few weeks or months...
...tracking down Jesse Pinkman and you kill him too.
A pointless exercise, it seems to me, but that is option A.
What is option B?
I continue cooking.
You and I both forget about Pinkman.
We forget this ever happened.
We consider this a Ione hiccup...
...in an otherwise long and fruitful business arrangement.
I prefer option B.
You'd need a new assistant.
I could get right on that.
No.
This time, I choose.
Your car...
...get it fixed.
Yeah.
Really?
It's good to see you.
Thanks.
It's good to be back.
Well, shall we?
By all means, Gale, let's cook.
What about that rhinoceros? You think he'd make a good pet?
No.
No?
Don't you think if you called, he'd come running?
I bet he would. I bet he'd come running:
You're silly, Pop-Pop.
Well, a little. But he'd probably knock everything over.
Plus, there's that big nose of his.
That's not a nose, that's a horn.
Is that so?
His real nose is little.
I learn all kinds of things being with you.
Okay, June bug, these are for you.
What about the rest?
The rest are for me.
No, they're not. You're too old for balloons.
You're never too old for balloons. Give me a hug.
I see your mama. Don't keep her waiting.
Bye, Pop-Pop.
Bye, baby.
Hi, sweetie. Did you have fun with Pop-Pop?
Please. Please, no.
Chow, you have anything you wanna tell me?
Thank God you're here. They keep me prisoner.
They keep you prisoner.
I don't do nothing for them ever.
They try and make me. I say, no.
They steal my chemicals. I can't stop them. I am businessman.
You're a business... The lady out front...
Hey, lady, are you still there? Ask her if she's still there.
She says, yes.
How's her driving? Driving. Is she good behind the wheel?
Good. She's good driver.
Licensed? Dependable?
She has a Camry.
Good.
The trucks will be here first thing in the morning.
I strongly recommend that you return our calls next time.
So have her drive you to the hospital.
She's gonna need her shoe.
Where'd they cross?
Laredo, looks like.
They didn't exactly send their A players.
But like you said, it's cartel, all right.
Probing for weakness.
Well, they didn't find any.
What about Pinkman?
I'm making inquiries.
Yeah, that's two. All right, let's close it up.
All right, bring it down.
You ready?
Okay, we're good.
You can take your mask off now.
Does that guy ever leave?
When exactly did that start?
It's new.
We had a...
We had a little drama with the person you replaced.
Sorry to hear that.
No, it'll be fine.
Things will continue to smooth out and...
Yeah, it'll be fine.
By the way, if you're at all worried about working with me...
No, I'm not.
Whatever my shortcomings last time...
...I intend for things to go perfectly from here on out.
So if there is...?
Gale, you're great.
Seriously.
I just...
However you like things to be done is exactly how we're gonna do them.
Period.
From here on out, so...
Please, teach me.
Okay.
Gale. It's good to see you.
Mr. Fring.
Wow, this is...
I should have called. I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
No. No, no, not at all. Please, come in.
Can I offer you something? A crÃ¨me de menthe?
No. No, thank you.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
Oh, no, no. It's no inconvenience.
I need to talk to you about something.
Something rather pressing.
If push came to shove, I was wondering...
...how soon you might be able to take over the lab yourself.
You and an assistant.
Why would?
Why would push come to shove?
Has Walter ever talked to you...
...about why he got into this particular line of work?
I guess I assumed it was because it pays so well.
It is, but specifically...
...has he ever spoken to you about his health problems?
I'm not surprised. He's a very private person.
What exactly are his health problems?
He's dying of cancer.
It is why he does this, to provide for his family, which he's accomplished.
They will never want for anything, he's seen to that.
How long does he have?
That is very much the question.
He does not wanna talk about it. And every time I bring it up with him...
I don't know that he's fully accepted the reality of it.
And not to sound cold-blooded, but I am running a business here.
No, I understand.
I have a very large investment in this.
There's so much overhead that I can't afford to shut down.
Not even for a week.
So you understand my concern.
And my desire for continuity.
I do. Absolutely.
Now, I intend to keep Walter on as long as he wants...
...assuming that he's physically up to it.
But as he cannot or will not tell me how long that might be...
...I must prepare for the worst-case scenario.
Well, worst-case scenario...
I suppose if we had...
...at least a few more cooks together.
You don't think you're ready now?
Well, I mean...
...he is such a...
A master.
There's always more for me to learn.
But I'm thinking that if we had...
...say...
...one or two more cooks.
One more...
...I guess would do it. I suppose.
I believe in you, Gale.
I know that when the time comes, you will be ready.
What's up?
Walt, is there?
Any particular trick to purging the catalyst bed?
No, it's pretty straightforward. I'll show you when we get there.
Yeah?
Tell him I'm in conference.
I'm in conference.
I'm looking to find a client of yours.
I was hoping you could help me out with an address.
Which client?
Jesse Pinkman.
Jesse-Pinkman-in-the-phone-book Jesse Pinkman.
How would one track him down, I wonder.
You're still here.
I need your full attention, Saul.
Jesse Pinkman. Current whereabouts.
The sooner you tell me, the sooner you get back to whatever this is.
What am I, an 8th-grade hall monitor? Current whereabouts.
Let me tell you something, Mike, you...
Whoa, you are good right there.
Now, let's both get comfortable.
Now, when I say, I'm looking for Pinkman...
...we both know why, don't we?
You pretending otherwise only wastes my time and serves to annoy me.
Look, Mike...
...there are rules to this lawyer thing.
Is that right?
Yeah.
Attorney-client privilege. That's a big one.
That's something I provide for you.
So if I give up Pinkman...
...then you're gonna be asking, "Saul gives them up pretty easy.
What's to keep him from giving me up?" You see?
So then, where's the trust?
I trust the hole in the desert I'd leave you in.
Yeah, that's an argument.
Saul...
...don't make me beat you till your legs don't work.
Now tell me where to find him. You know it's the right thing.
I can't tell you, Mike, all right? I...
Look, if I was to tell you, well, I just... I couldn't live with myself.
I'm sorry.
But who's to say I didn't write the address down in my day planner?
Or on a scratch piece of paper somewhere?
Who's to say I didn't write down a location...
...strictly for my own professional use?
Do not touch anything on my desk.
I'm gonna leave the room, make myself a NescafÃ©.
I'm just looking out for you, that's all. Like a mother hen.
Money-laundering ain't what it used to be. God, do I miss the '80s.
You're wasting your time. I'm buying the car wash, end of story.
Well, one look at this place, you're gonna fall in love, so...
Was I right? Where else you gonna find a cash-only business that's this fun?
Unless we're talking massage parlors, and, I don't see it. Shall we?
You ever actually play laser tag?
You know, it's good cardio. Plus, you get to shoot at kids.
You got your bumper cars over there down that way.
Got your arcade here, all the latest video games.
Snack bar's there. Nothing stopping you from selling beer to the parents.
That's a whole new revenue stream...
All right, already. We're good.
Holy Christ.
We're good? This constitutes good where you're from?
My car is bugged?
I said, maybe. Maybe bugged.
I'm being followed? What the hell have you gotten me into?
My own PI is threatening to break my legs. That's like Thomas Magnum...
...threatening that little prissy guy with the mustache.
Over and above. Service-wise, this is over and above.
You and I survive this...
...I'm seriously rethinking my pricing, yeah.
And that goes double for you, Hip-Hop.
Okay, my guy's no dummy, right?
I give us maybe 24 hours before he figures out that address goes nowhere.
You guys do your thing, make it snappy.
I'll go see if they have "Tetris" or something.
So how you holding up?
You?
I got my old job back.
At least until they kill me and Gale takes over.
So he's their boy, huh?
He's their boy.
How long you think you've got?
Well, he asks a lot of questions about the cooking process.
I try to be as vague as possible, but I got that guy Victor watching me...
...listening to every word I say.
You know, maybe that the only thing saving me is Gale's fastidiousness.
And once he feels confident that he knows my entire method...
So, what do we do?
You know what we do.
There's got to be some other way.
Maybe it's better for you to just go to the cops.
All right? I mean, I can't believe I'm saying that and all...
...but for your family.
The DEA would love you, all the shit you could tell them.
Federal witness protection, that's a good deal.
As for me, I'll hit the road, yo. I mean, I'll make it.
We had a good run.
But it's over.
Never the DEA.
The cook can't stop.
That's the one thing I'm certain of, production cannot stop.
Gus can't afford to.
So if I'm the only chemist that he's got...
...then I've got leverage, and leverage keeps me alive.
It keeps you alive too. I think I can see to that.
If I'm the only chemist that he's got.
I can't do it, Mr. White.
Like you said, I'm...
I'm not a...
I can't do it.
I'll do it.
I'm gonna need your help.
I mean, they're watching me day and night.
They never leave me alone with Gale, not for a moment.
Hell, I don't even know where the man lives.
He's not in the phone book, I can't find him on the Internet...
...and I can't do it in the lab, Victor's always there.
But if I could just...
...shake Victor, for even an hour one night...
...I think then that...
I may be able...
...to make it look like an accident.
There's got to be some other way.
I'm all ears.
But when it comes down to you and me versus him, I'm sorry.
I'm truly sorry...
...but it's gonna be him.
Now, you are the only edge that I've got...
...as long as they don't know that you're in town.
But I need you to track him, get me his address.
And I'll do the rest.
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.
Are you gonna save mine?
Yeah?
Please, tell me you found him.
6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard. Apartment 6.
You there?
Yeah.
6353 Juan Tabo. Number 6. Got it.
He's home?
Yep.
Anyone watching the place?
No. Looks pretty much wide-open.
When are you gonna do it?
Tonight.
Once it gets dark.
Don't do this, Mr. White.
Please. Go to the cops.
We got a problem.
Some kind of chemical leaking in your lab.
Better come with me.
I'll follow you.
They tell me to bring you, I bring you. Come on, get in the car.
I don't know if it's a barrel leak...
...but you got something mighty stinky down there.
After you.
Walter, the sooner you figure out what this is, the sooner we all go home.
Please, don't do this.
Mike...
...you don't have to do this.
Yeah, unfortunately, I do, Walter.
Downstairs.
I'll cook. I'll cook for free. There won't be any more trouble, I promise you.
No.
If I could talk to Gus...
No. ...I can make him understand.
If I could talk to Gus, I can convince him.
Just let me, please... Please.
Please, let me talk to him.
Shut up! Shut up.
I can't do it. I'm sorry.
I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.
Like you said, he's the problem. He's always been the problem.
And without him, we would... And he's in town, all right?
He's not in Virginia or wherever you're looking.
He's right here in Albuquerque and I could take you to him.
I'll take you right to him.
What do you say?
Where is he?
Right now, you give me an address.
I don't... He moves. He moves around.
But if you let me call him... No, no, please.
No, I just... My phone. I'll just...
It's just my phone. I'll call him and I'll have him meet me.
All right? Okay?
Okay?
Did you do it?
Mr. White?
Did you do it?
No, I didn't do it.
I can't now.
It's gonna have to be you.
What? No way, man.
You're closer than we are. You'll have a 20-minute lead.
They've got me, they're going to kill me.
Jesse, do it now! Do it!
Son of a bitch!
Do it, Jesse! Do it!
Just what the hell was that exactly?
You might wanna hold off.
Yeah?
Why?
Because your boss is gonna need me.
6353 Juan Tabo, Apartment 6.
Yeah.
Hi. How can I help you?
Take whatever you want.
I have money. I have...
I got a lot of money.
I have...
Please, don't do this.
You don't... You...
You... You don't have to do this.
Here you go.
What happened there?
It's my birthday.
Yeah? Well, happy birthday.
Birthday meals are free at Denny's. All you gotta show is a valid ID.
I'm good. Thanks.
Really? Free meal. Free is good.
Even if I was, like, rich, free is always good.
Thank you.
Okay.
New Hampshire. You're a long way from home.
How long a drive is that?
About 30 hours, if all you stop for is gas.
You headed to California?
No. Here.
Okay.
So, what's here?
Business.
You know, I was in Boston once. Boston and a little town called Swampscott...
...which is right outside of Boston.
That's kind of near New Hampshire, right?
Yeah. More or less.
Yeah, I was maybe 6, so I don't really remember it.
I want to say I liked it. They got this really big aquarium.
Yeah. Great science museum there.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Hi.
My name's Lucy. I'll be your server.
I got your word this won't wind up crossing the border?
It's never leaving town.
Is there a manual? Instruction manual?
I pulled something off the Internet.
It's in there.
Well...
...good luck, I guess.
Happy birthday, Mr. Lambert.
Jesus, Walt, the news here... Gus Fring is dead.
He was blown up along with some person from some Mexican cartel...
...and the DEA has no idea what to make of it.
Do you know about this?
Walt?
Walt, I need you to--
<i>It's over. We're safe.</i>
Was this you?
<i>What happened?</i>
I won.
Oh, God.
Dad.
Dad.
Hey.
Hey.
Serious-- You don't have the TV on? Seriously?
No, sorry, I...
You didn't tell him about Mr. Fring?
He knows.
Welcome home.
Jesus, Dad, it's all they're talking about.
They haven't said it on TV yet...
...but Uncle Hank says he was this major, major drug dealer.
I mean, like, holy shit.
Your uncle is safe, right? How do they know that?
Uncle Hank was after this guy all along.
He didn't tell us, but he was.
He even took me to his restaurant one time...
...just, like, totally toying with the guy...
...just like, "I got my eye on you." Like that.
They figure Mr. Fring was the one who put the hit out on Uncle Hank.
Just somebody got to him first.
Yeah, wow.
Aunt Marie's still pretty freaked.
She didn't want us to leave, but Mom figured it was time.
There's still some agents over there, but they figure it's over.
Like, when this hits the news...
...Uncle Hank is gonna be a hero.
Yeah.
I mean, even more so than before.
Seriously.
See-- See if it's on TV.
Yeah, yeah, I want to.
Just give me a couple minutes, huh?
<i>--Around the 24-yard-line. They break huddle--</i>
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, sweet pea.
Oh, Daddy missed you so much.
Yes, he did.
I know.
I missed you too.
Well, don't you think I rate a "hello," at least?
Hello.
Hello to you too.
So are you gonna talk to me here?
Are you gonna...
You gonna show some kind of...
I don't know, some kind of mild relief that I'm alive?
I am relieved, Walt.
And scared.
Scared?
Scared of what?
You.
Hey.
Hi.
Oh, shit.
Jesus, just say it already.
Tell me "I told you so." Get it out of your system...
...before you need, like, dialysis or something.
It's exactly like Boetticher's drawings.
Where were the two bodies?
Over by the freight elevator. Over there.
No idea who they were?
No, not much left.
Apparently the teeth do this popcorn thing when they get too hot...
...so they tell me.
Whoever torched it did it up right.
Fring, you magnificent bastard.
What do you figure that was?
I don't know, some kind of lab equipment?
Maybe a camera?
Come on. Come on, you, be nice. Be nice.
Come on. Hey. Hey!
You be nice. Just be nice.
Let Wendell in there.
If Wendell doesn't eat, nobody eats.
Yeah.
It's Gustavo.
He's dead.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
Hold up! Hold up!
Get out of my way, kid.
Wait a minute, all right? Let him talk.
I am done listening to this asshole talk.
Now get out of my way.
He's got something you need to hear, all right?
What'd you do, Jesse? Do you even know?
Do you even know what you've done?
Yeah, he saved his own life--
One more word.
Mike. Mike.
If you kill him, you're gonna have to kill me. Come on.
Oh, Jesse.
Jesus.
What is it with you guys?
Honest to God.
May I?
Look, whatever differences you and I have, they'll keep.
Right now we've got bigger fish to fry.
Bigger fish.
The video cameras.
Gus kept cameras on us at the lab...
...at the laundry, God only knows where else.
And of course, when I say "us," I'm including you.
Mike.
Mike, if he taped all that shit...
...us cooking, you picking up...
If Gus had a record of that and the police get to it before we do...
You son of a bitch.
Mike, it's all on tape somewhere, or a hard drive.
Where?
Where did he keep it?
He had a laptop in his office.
Kept it in the back of the restaurant.
It all fed straight to there.
What?
Keys, scumbag.
It's the universal symbol for keys.
Meter fraud. And yes, yes, it's a big deal.
Guy rigs his meter so he's paying <i>2</i> cents less for first-class postage.
I'm here to tell you that the USPS takes that very seriously.
It's money out of your pocket, it's money out of my pocket.
I was hoping-- Now, look, sarge.
Do you think we could work together on this thing? You folks have it over there?
Could you tell me that, at least?
Yeah.
Well, thanks for your help.
Inspector Clark-- Inspector Dave Clark, like the Dave Clark Five?
Before your time.
Well, you feel free to call me day or night at this number.
Yes, sir. No, you as well.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.
We're boned.
Well...
You know how they say "it's been a pleasure"?
It hasn't.
Are you gonna tell us about the laptop?
Where you going?
I'm getting the hell out of Dodge, kid.
And so should you. It's just a matter of time.
Mike, where is the laptop?
What the hell difference does it make? They got it. End of story.
A.P.D., Northwest Area Command on Second.
They tagged it, they filed it...
...it's in the system, and they locked it in their evidence room.
All right.
All right. So describe the building.
Describe the...
How about I describe Fort Knox?
And what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna put on your black leotard and go dangling on a clothesline?
It's a building full of cops. What else do you need to know?
And why in the hell am I talking to you?
Mike, we gotta do something.
I am doing something.
He's good with this stuff, okay? Just give him a chance.
Now, you look.
That laptop might as well be on the moon.
They build these evidence rooms like bank vaults because guess what...
...lunatics like you wanna break into them.
But unlike a bank vault, this is a place that is guarded 24 hours a day...
...by the police.
There's no way you're getting it out of there.
Who said that we have to get it out of there?
We just need to destroy what's on it.
Oh, so now you wanna blow up a police station?
I don't believe I said that, no.
Nursing home full of old folks just whet your appetite.
Now you wanna kill a bunch of cops.
I never said anything about killing anybody.
I am, however, considering the possibility of a device.
A device.
Yes, a small device.
Say this device gets filed into evidence.
Now it is inside that room.
What about a magnet?
You wanna commit a whole other crime just to get this bomb into evidence.
Who said "bomb"? I said "a device."
What about a magnet?
An incendiary device. One quick fire is all it would take.
You don't think they have fire suppression? I'm not talking sprinklers.
I'm talking about halon. Because halon doesn't destroy evidence.
A magnet, though, maybe like--
A bomb then. We plant a bomb outside.
Oh, actually I knew a crew out of Fort Worth...
...that tried to blow up an evidence room from outside.
About all they did was take out a couple of hedges.
You are probably talking about <i>2</i> feet of reinforced concrete.
Or what about a magnet?
What magnet? What about it?
You know, just:
So, what do you think?
Expensive.
Leaving aside engineering...
...rigging some kind of alternate power source...
...my primary sticking point is I actually need the thing.
As you gentlemen can see, it's paying the bills.
But I mean it's feasible, doable?
Hey, we're living in a time of string theories and God particles.
Feasible, doable? Yeah, sure, why not?
Expensive.
What would you put it in?
What about that? Does it run?
We can get it running.
What's the box made of?
Plywood and aluminium, just what you need.
All right, so you wanna talk money?
Step into my office.
Hey, listen.
I don't actually have any money right now.
My wife... There's an IRS issue.
Anyway, I'd appreciate it if you could spot me my share. I'll pay you back.
Yeah. Whatever.
Right.
You coming?
If you have any brains, you'll take that money you saved...
...and you'll skip town. Today. Right now.
You don't think this can work?
Is that a serious question?
Mike, this is a three-man job.
The only way I know it won't work for sure is if we don't have you.
Come in.
Get in. Close the door.
What did we say about you coming here?
Yeah, speaking of things that tend to rile you up...
...the police, they may call.
Let me back up a little. Can I sit down? I'm gonna sit down.
Okay, why are the police gonna call?
May call you. Distant, outside possibility.
But on the off chance, I want you thinking one thought:
<i>Hogan's Heroes.</i>
Sergeant Schultz. You remember Sergeant Schultz?
"I know nothing. I see nothing."
You remember how he-- I want you like that.
Okay, Saul, why are the police--
There was an incident with Beneke--
Oh, God.
And it's--
Oh, Jesus.
What incident?
An act of God.
There's no right. There's no wrong.
I mean, it just-- That's the best phrase.
It fits, but we got a problem.
Ted's dead.
Sorry?
Ted is dead?
No. No, no.
He just woke up.
Right-o, that should do her.
All right, watches off.
Necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets...
Gold. These are nonferrous.
Better hope.
What about that stuff you young guys wear on the end of your pricks?
Speak now or forever sing soprano. What's up with that, by the way?
Why would anybody wanna put a metal ring through the end of their prick?
What are you looking at me for?
All right, guns, knives...
...tools, keys, plates in your head...
...artificial hips.
Check your pockets for me one more time, please.
Oh, credit cards.
You want that plastic working come Miller time.
You know, I can foresee a lot of possible outcomes to this thing...
...and not a single one of them involves Miller time.
P.M.A.
Positive mental attitude.
Okay, I think we're good to go.
All right, where do you want me with this?
Start 40 feet out. That's more than the length of the room.
Who's doing the honours?
Me.
Flip that switch, turns it on.
Twist this here. That's your power control.
All right.
Everybody ready?
Yeah.
Okay.
Fire in the hole!
All right, you ready?
Fingers crossed it don't yank the drive shaft through the floor.
Anything?
Nope. It's still working.
All right, start walking forward slowly.
Wait, wait, wait.
Yeah. That did it.
Yes.
Yeah, bitch!
Magnets!
How many batteries is this?
That there's 21, wired in series, so 21 times 12.
Two hundred fifty-two volts.
Can you add 21 more, wired in parallel?
UP the amperage?
Everything goes flying in that evidence room...
...it's gonna make one hell of a noise, and there goes your element of surprise.
Won't matter.
Sixty seconds, we'll be gone.
Excuse me.
Hi. Who are you looking for?
Ted Beneke. I'm a friend of his.
But if it's not a good time, I could--
No, no, no, this is fine. I'm just finishing up. Come on in.
Hey, Ted.
I tell you, he's been a real champ.
His colour's better and his blood pressure's up.
We are gonna have you eating solid food in a day or two...
...I bet you money.
That's wonderful.
All right, I'm just down the hall.
Ted.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Ted, I just...
I don't even know--
Skyler.
I haven't said anything...
...to anyone.
I told them it was an accident.
I tripped...
...and fell. That is all they know.
Just...
I've-- I've got children.
Family.
I swear to you.
Please.
I just...
I--
...will never breathe...
...one word of this.
Good.
It should be about a quarter of the way down on the left.
We'll do a loop and come around the other side. Turn here.
Right up there.
That's the wall.
What the hell is this? There's some big-ass hump in the way.
So? Just drive over it.
All right.
Come on, you can do it.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
You got it.
Cut it.
It's, like, 8 feet away. Is this cool? Is this close enough?
It'll work.
Mr. White, let's go.
Hold on.
Let's just go!
Hang on.
Mr. White, let's get out of here.
Just one minute.
Turn it off! Turn it off.
I will.
Jacocks! Jacocks, you okay?
Outside! Outside!
Yeah, bitch!
Shut up.
Yeah.
And what exactly are you celebrating? You left the truck behind.
So what?
"So what"?
So what if they find prints?
And what if they trace it back to the wrecking yard?
They won't.
There's no prints, I made sure of that.
There's no paperwork on the truck, the magnet or the batteries.
Untraceable salvage, all of it.
I made sure of that too.
Well, you got all the answers.
So you tell me, Answer Man, did all that even work just now?
Yes. It worked.
And I'm supposed to take that on faith?
Yeah? And why?
How do we know?
Because I say so.
07-66-26432.
Gutierrez, Alvin B.
Roofing hammer.
Undamaged. Bag still sealed.
11-58-73321 .
Fring, Gustavo.
Samsung laptop computer.
Damaged. Glass screen is broken and in pieces.
Bag still sealed.
11-58-73317.
Fring, Gustavo. Framed photograph of two men.
Damaged.
The glass is broken...
...and photo has slipped out of its frame.
Bag appears to be slightly punctured by broken glass.
Check it out.
That's not on the manifest.
All right, so first off, I'm not a marriage counsellor.
Nor do I take sides in this thing.
And, not taking sides, mind you...
...but you did put her in charge of your money...
...which I advised against, if you'll recall...
...all of which is not to be construed as an "I told you so."
I'm just walking you through my mental process, so to speak.
So she comes to me with a problem.
That she's been cooking Beneke's books, he's in Dutch with the IRS...
...and once they audit, it's Rio de Caca for the both of them.
To which I say, "Hey, let's involve Walt in this discussion."
To which she says, "No, let's cut Beneke a cheque...
...so's he can pay off the IRS."
Again, not taking sides, but she really was trying to protect you.
A little feedback here might be nice.
"Let's involve Walt in this discussion."
Yeah, that's what I told her. She said no.
And you didn't argue the point.
You didn't think to contact me.
You were a tad preoccupied at the time, if you'll recall.
Okay. So you took it upon yourself...
...to give away $622,000 of my money...
...to a man who had been sleeping with my wife.
She's my client, same as you.
Does this arrangement get a little tricky at times?
Absolutely.
But I try my best, you know, ethically, in my duty--
Ethically?
I'm sorry. I must be hearing things.
Did you actually just use the word "ethically" in a sentence?
You're not Clarence Darrow, Saul.
You're a two-bit bus-bench lawyer.
And you work for me.
Yeah, well, Clarence Darrow never had a client like you ask him...
...for something...
...like this.
Okay? Yeah, I put my ass on the line for you.
Huell too.
He's got fingers like hot dogs. He could've easily busted this in two...
...and killed everyone in the office. But do I complain?
No. Beg, borrow or steal, I'm your huckleberry.
I go the extra mile.
Only you never told me that kid would wind up in the hospital.
You know--
Take that thing and get the hell out of here.
You and me, we're done.
What are you...?
Come on. Hey.
Hey.
We're done when I say we're done.
Yes, you are. Yes.
Hey.
I heard what happened to Ted.
He's not gonna talk.
Yeah.
I forgive you.

Honey mustard.
<i>Honest to God, it's starting to drive me crazy.</i>
<i>- Don't.
It keeps me awake.</i>
<i>I lay there thinking, "Where is it? Where did it go?"</i>
<i>- And I just-- I can't even-- I have no idea.
Jesse, look.</i>
<i>Doesn't it make sense that it wound up in the lab?</i>
<i>I thought about that a lot. But I just don't see how.</i>
<i>Well, look. You had the pack in your pocket of your jacket, right?</i>
<i>- Yeah.
And your jacket was in your locker.</i>
<i>So maybe the cigarette fell out of the pocket...</i>
<i>and wound up in the locker, and now it's all burned up.</i>
<i>- It's gone.
Yeah.</i>
<i>But I don't know that, you know?</i>
<i>I can't ever know for sure.</i>
<i>Well, look, did you check your house?</i>
<i>Did you--? Maybe it's somewhere in your house.</i>
<i>No, man. I've looked everywhere, okay?</i>
<i>- Your car? Did you check your car?
No.</i>
<i>- Thoroughly?
Yes, of course. It's not in my house.</i>
<i>It's not in my car. The more I think about</i> it...
<i>...there's no way it fell out in my locker.</i>
<i>Somebody's gonna find it on the street.</i>
<i>- You don't know that.
Somewhere where I dropped it.</i>
<i>Some innocent person, some kid maybe, even.</i>
<i>They're gonna pick it up, and it's gonna--</i>
<i>- You're working yourself all up.
Oh, my God!</i>
<i>You've gotta get a hold of yourself, here.</i>
<i>All right? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna come over there.</i>
<i>And together, we 're gonna look for this thing. All right?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>
What the hell is that?
My Roomba.
I already checked it.
When?
Like a week ago.
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus.
Okay. Easy, easy. Take it--
Careful. Let me see.
Is it still intact?
Yeah. Good.
Good. No worries.
Let me get rid of this.
What luck.
Well, I don't know about you...
...but I, for one, could use a beer.
You have any?
Jesse?
I almost shot you.
Hey, hey, now...
I almost killed you all because...
Listen.
It was just a misunderstanding, that's all.
No. No, no, no, no.
I don't know what's wrong with me, Mr. White. I--
Hey.
I don't know how I could be so stupid.
Stop that now. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
Listen to me.
What happened, happened for the best, you hear me?
And I wouldn't change a thing.
You and I working together...
...having each other's back.
It's what saved our lives.
I--
I want you to think about that as we go forward.
Go forward where?
<i>Stillwell, steady as you go.</i>
<i>Willie, note the time.</i>
<i>Captain, I'm sorry, but you're a sick man.</i>
<i>I'm relieving you as captain of the ship under article 184.</i>
<i>- Oh, God.
I don't know what you're talking about.</i>
<i>Helmsman, left 180.</i>
<i>Mr. Keith, what do I do? You're the officer on the deck.</i>
<i>I told you to come left. Now come left, and fast.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, sir, but you're not issuing orders on this bridge anymore.</i>
<i>I've relieved you.</i>
<i>I take full responsibil--</i>
Thanks for seeing us.
<i>We're here to talk partnership.</i>
Partnership?
Yes. Equal. Three ways.
You, Jesse and me.
Partnership in what?
Well, we figure we're gonna start cooking again.
You know, we figure, why not?
There's no denying the popularity of our product.
There's a market to be filled...
...and currently no one to fill it.
A lot of money to be made.
And obviously, Jesse and I have manufacture covered.
But there's still distribution...
...support, logistics, that sort of thing.
For instance, we'll need a steady supply of precursor.
With your experience and connections...
...you would be a great help.
Granted, there's a lot of work ahead.
There's a lot of rebuilding.
And, no doubt, our profits will be smaller.
At least at first. But each of us will receive a larger cut.
Owners, not employees.
Thanks, but no, thanks.
Mike, I know you don't care for me.
We've had our issues, you and I.
But I would suggest...
...that you leave emotion out of this decision.
I am.
You...
...are trouble.
I'm sorry the kid here doesn't see it, but I sure as hell do.
You are a time bomb...
...tick, tick, ticking...
...and I have no intention of being around for the boom.
Well, sleep on it.
Maybe you'll reconsider.
In the meantime, we're pressing on.
Morning.
Hey, why aren't you upstairs?
I came to see if you needed any help.
Yeah, well, I don't.
Well, I can see that, man. It's outstanding.
Yeah. I'm working on it, here.
Not exactly running marathons, you know.
Yeah, well, when did your couch-shaped ass ever run any marathons?
I'm proud of you, brother.
Yeah.
So how many Krauts we got?
Enough to invade Poland.
Came in their own G5, just like Oprah has.
G5, yeah?
Is that one where the wings go up like that?
I think they all do that.
They all have that?
Anyway, we got two U.S. Attorneys in the house.
Big doings. Your name keeps coming up.
Yeah? Hey, give me a hand here, would you?
Just a little bit there. Thanks.
<i>I hired Peter Schuler in 1992.</i>
Almost single-handedly, he grew our little restaurant division...
...into an industry leader...
...and a source of great personal pride.
I am shocked and saddened by his death...
...and outraged by the damage...
...his actions have wrought upon my grandfather's company.
Alleged actions.
An innocent man does not kill himself.
My people and I are here to help.
To your investigation, I pledge Madrigal's full cooperation and transparency.
I confess I have my selfish reasons.
I believe Peter Schuler was a lone anomaly.
But if that is not the case, I want to know it...
...just as you do.
So when you gonna announce it?
I don't know.
As I'm walking out the door with my big cardboard box.
Can't do that. You know damn well we're gonna throw you a big party.
Damn straight. We're talking a blowout.
Outstanding police work, Hank.
If only I'd listened.
But I guess the damage was done.
It's not right, them putting this on you.
Somebody's gotta go under the bus.
Ramey's a good man.
He'll do right by you.
Besides, this office practically runs itself.
Bullshit, it does.
Sir.
What's with that A.P.D. thing? The electromagnets?
They're thinking it's about Fring's laptop.
A couple of days before it happened, desk sergeant gets a call...
...from a "postal inspector" quote, unquote...
...wanting to know where they keep the thing.
And he told them? Jesus.
Anything left of the laptop?
Do we look that lucky?
I sneaked a peek before A.P.D. took it out of Fring's office.
The whole thing was encrypted. They wouldn't have got anything anyway, but...
So Hector Salamanca killed Fring.
But who gave Salamanca the bomb?
Whole lot of questions and not much in the way of answers.
Yet.
The A.P.D. did find some of Fring's financials.
That just might lead to something.
I had him out to my house.
Fourth of July.
We cooked out in the backyard.
My son shucked the corn. My daughter cut up potatoes.
Fring brought sea bass.
Every time I grill it now, I make a little foil pouch, just like he showed me.
That whole night, we were laughing...
...telling stories, drinking wine.
And he's somebody else completely.
Right in front of me.
Right under my nose.
Hi. What can I get you?
Just tea. Chamomile.
Oh, sorry. We don't have chamomile tea.
Then some sort of bergamot, not Earl Grey.
I like soy milk instead of dairy.
We don't have soy milk or any sort of bergamot.
You're really running me through my paces here.
Well, English breakfast, I guess.
We have Lipton's.
That's pretty much all we have.
I would like a cup of hot water, filtered, if possible, and a slice of lemon.
I'm assuming you don't have stevia?
Never mind. I brought my own.
You coming to me, or am I coming to you?
Face forward. We'll talk like this.
I guess I'm coming to you.
Take a breath, will you?
This place is safe. No one's gonna see you here.
My God. Duane, this is so-- Thank you.
How did I not see you sitting back there? So weird.
You want anything else, Mike?
No. I'm good, Fran. Thanks.
Now...
...how about we lose the sunglasses?
I feel like I'm talking to Jackie Onassis here.
There you go.
Breathe in, breathe out.
Drink your whatever.
Who killed Gus?
Haven't I told you not to worry about that?
Now, what do you want from me, and why is it so important?
What's this?
A list of 11 names.
Okay.
You know them all.
I do.
Those 11 men-- And I think you know this, Mike.
Those 11 could sink us, you and me both.
Where are we going with this?
No specific... I'm just pointing out facts.
These men-- Your men, yours and Gus'...
...they were on the payroll, very publicly.
They trace back to Pollos, the laundry, to Madrigal.
They're gonna get picked up by the police. When they do...
...and threatened, and there's only one way out--
And I'm not saying all of them, okay?
All it's gonna take is two or three, or even one.
But there's always a weak link. But they're gonna talk.
At least one's gonna talk about you, me, and that's all it's gonna take.
These are the 11 I know of, but I'd love your input.
I never met your chemist, for instance.
I'd love your input.
You want me to kill every man on that list?
That's a leap, what you just...
No, I didn't say that.
But if you think that'd be wise...
You're scared, aren't you?
Yeah.
You're very upset, which I'm gonna factor into my response here.
These are my guys, and they are solid.
Understand?
What about Chow at the warehouse?
Didn't you have to shoot him through the hand?
Think that didn't stick in his memory?
What about Dennis at the laundry?
They're sure to pick him up.
They already have.
They picked him up last night.
My guys are solid.
I vetted them with great care...
...and Fring made sure they were well compensated...
...in the event of a situation such as this. They're paid to stand up to the heat...
...keep their mouths shut, no matter what.
And they will.
I don't know what movies you've been watching...
...but in the real world, we don't kill 11 people...
...as some kind of prophylactic measure.
Look at me...
...and say you understand.
I understand.
I get it.
So we're off that very silly idea?
Good.
Drink your hot water.
I gotta go.
Did you have enough?
Yeah. I'm good.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye, big brother.
Say bye to Mom for me.
I will. Have a good day.
You too.
Skyler.
Hey.
The car wash opens in 15 minutes.
Mariano can open for me today.
Hey, how about you get up, huh?
Come on.
A shower will feel good.
Hey, Chow.
How you holding up?
Okay.
You know, they...
They talked to me.
You can't smoke in here, Chow.
<i>Thanks for coming down.</i>
Have a seat, Mr. Ehrmantraut.
Am I saying that right?
Close enough.
Once more, you're waiving your right to have an attorney present?
Correct.
Could you state that to the camera?
I'm waiving my right to have an attorney present.
Okay, then. We just have a few questions.
You're currently employed by the Pollos Hermanos chain.
Is that correct?
Yes, I am.
What do you do there?
Corporate security.
Corporate security.
Yeah.
What's that? Like guarding the special sauce?
I conduct employee background checks.
I oversee loss prevention.
At a fast-food restaurant, that's a full-time job?
We have 14 locations. So, yes, it's a full-time job.
Yeah, well, if I were you, I'd start sending out those rÃ©sumÃ©s.
It says here you're a private investigator?
Where you licensed?
New Mexico, Arizona, Utah.
Every state where we operate.
Colorado? You have some restaurants there, right?
Colorado doesn't require licensure.
Licensed to carry a firearm?
Concealed carry? Yes, I am.
Which states?
It'd be quicker to mention the states in which I'm not.
And if we pulled your CCPs, everything would be in order?
I'm guessing you've already done that, so you tell me.
You strike me as a former cop.
Am I right?
Where at?
Philadelphia.
Philly.
The City of Brotherly Love. Turns out we know some folks there...
...and they told us that your tenure as a police officer...
...ended somewhat dramatically?
You wanna talk about that?
Not particularly.
Yeah, me neither.
See, I'm more interested in why Gus Fring decided to put a guy like you...
...in charge of his corporate security.
I mean, given your history...
...doing background checks on pimple-faced fry cooks.
Seems like overkill.
What else you do for Fring?
He must've needed help running that drug empire of his, no?
Drug empire? First I'm hearing about that.
I don't know anything about that.
We have a guy that could put you in that underground lab...
...and he'll testify to it. So from here on out, this can go hard or easy.
So what's it gonna be?
Forget your handcuffs?
I'm confused. Am I under arrest here, or am I not?
You wanna state that for the camera?
You are not under arrest, currently.
Agents, do you have any more questions for me?
Because you've got me very stirred up with all these false accusations.
If I'm not under arrest, I'd prefer to leave.
Oh, well...
I suppose we could talk about the $2 million...
...in your granddaughter's name.
Yeah. It seems Fring had all these secret offshore accounts...
...that he would deposit money into. Like, well, an even dozen of them.
And they're all in the names of certain people on his payroll.
The manager of the laundry...
...a couple guys from the Pollos distribution centre.
There was the owner of a chemical warehouse, a bunch of others.
You know, guys that must've been getting paid off the books.
Anyway, one of the names was Kaylee Ehrmantraut.
Ten years old and just cute as a button.
Yeah. Two million and change we found on deposit for her.
Way more than anybody else.
Now, my partner here, he took one look at that and said:
"Shit, man. This fifth-grade girl is the muscle behind Fring's entire operation."
I said, "Whoa, whoa, hey, partner, slow down there.
Maybe it was actually her dear old granddaddy."
Impressive, no? That... level of insight?
He's not impressed, Gomey.
Perhaps he's picturing all that money going bye-bye.
Yeah, well, I mean, the government's gonna take every last dollar, unless...
Here's the thing, Mike-- Or Michael?
Mr. Ehrmantraut.
Here's the thing, Mike.
Lucky, you didn't touch that money.
I cannot say the same for the other 11 on the list.
One of your guys is gonna roll...
...and then we'll definitely remember the handcuffs.
Now, before that day comes, you can do yourself a solid.
You can tell us what you know...
...you can tell us who's still out there...
...and if we like your story...
...good things can happen.
Kaylee might be able to keep some of that money.
Maybe.
So what do you say?
I don't know anything about any money.
I don't know what you're talking about.
First order of business is to find a new place to cook. Before anyone says it...
...no more RV's.
I don't know.
The crystal ship did pretty good for us.
The "crystal ship"?
Yeah. That's what I called it.
Well, I'll admit, it held its own as a starter lab...
...but it was too dark, too small...
...not to mention it could've broken down at any moment.
Saul, find us someplace safe from prying eyes.
Security against detection is paramount.
But I don't wanna drive too far. No more 50-mile treks to some Indian reservation.
In town is trickier. I mean, you got a lot more of your prying eyes.
If Gus can manage it, then so can we.
Precursor. Where are we with that?
We're good on everything except methylamine.
No surprise.
It's dry as hell out there.
What if we switched back to a pseudo cook?
Absolutely out of the question.
Jesse, there is methylamine out there. I know it.
Yeah, but what if there's not?
Because there isn't.
I mean, really.
There is.
Have faith.
Can I offer a thought?
Say a guy wins the lottery.
Ten million bucks.
The very next day, what's the one thing he does not do?
He does not go buy another lottery ticket, right?
He counts his lucky stars, and he sails off into the sunset...
...which, seems to me, and all due respect...
...some advice you two might take.
What lottery did I win, exactly?
Hey, you're alive.
I mean, as far as I'm concerned, that's the Irish sweepstakes.
I'm alive, and I'm broke.
Counting the money that I owe Jesse, I'm about 40 grand in the hole.
Does that seem like an acceptable stopping point to you?
There is gold in the streets...
...just waiting for someone to come and scoop it up.
But me, I should quit now. Jesse, too, I suppose, huh?
I got you this time, kid.
Hey, how come you get two, and I only get one?
Oh, what are you gonna--?
That one's mine!
Green is beating orange.
No.
Green is beating orange.
Pink is beating your yellow one.
I give up. bah)'-
You're too good.
Yeah?
<i>It's me. You got a minute?</i>
Yeah. A minute. What's up, Chow?
The DEA, they call me to come back.
Say they want to talk more.
<i>I'm sure they do.</i>
Did you call your lawyer?
<i>Yeah, but, Mike, the DEA take all my money.</i>
<i>I need it.</i>
I need my money.
You understand.
<i>What do you want me to do about it?</i>
I don't know.
I don't know. We gotta talk.
<i>Not on the phone.</i>
<i>Can you come to my house?</i>
All right.
<i>You give me two hours.</i>
Chris.
I'd like you to drop your gun where you stand...
...and then turn around very slowly.
Come on over and sit next to Chow.
How much was she gonna pay you?
Ten thousand a name.
How far did you get down the list?
Just Chow.
I figured I'd start with you.
For you, she was gonna pay 30.
I'm really sorry about this, Mike, but I needed the money.
Those feds, they took it all, man.
I know.
Are you ready?
Listen, Mike--
Kiira, come and have some cookies.
It's a cookie!
It's a cookie, yes!
Let's go.
Let's count.
Well, look at this. What are you doing?
Hey, Mommy!
What are you doing still up?
Hey, yourself. Give me a kiss.
She said she wanted to wait for you.
She does, huh?
Well, who's the adult here, Delores?
Tell me she ate her dinner, at least.
Oh, yes, she ate everything.
She ate her peas, her carrots.
Do whatever it takes to keep them out of here, or they die.
A whole lot.
Understand?
Yep.
That's right, my girl.
Delores, I'm gonna take a bath. Put Kiira to bed and then go on home.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Really?
You don't want me to wait for you?
No, you go home. Thank you.
Si, Miss Lydia.
Mommy, you gonna come say good night to me?
Yeah, honey. After Mommy takes a bath.
Okay.
Love you.
Mommy's very tired, so let's go to bed.
Don't hurt my daughter.
I won't have to unless you scream.
You know why I'm here?
What are you waiting for?
The nanny to leave.
If you have anything to say to me, now's the time.
Two good men died because of you.
Don't shoot me in the face.
Please. I don't want my daughter seeing me like that.
Your daughter won't see you.
She will. She'll find me.
She never once sleeps through the night.
Nobody's gonna find you.
Wait. What?
No. No. No.
No. She has to find me.
Lower your voice.
She has to find me.
She has to find me.
You want your 5-year-old daughter stumbling across your dead body?
I can't disappear. She has to know I didn't leave her.
She has to know that.
Keep your voice down.
I don't care what you do.
I'll scream, and I'll keep screaming.
My daughter's not thinking I abandoned her!
Shut up and calm down.
I don't care. You have to promise. You have to promise me.
Promise I don't disappear.
Can you still get your hands on methylamine?
Methylamine, Lydia. Can you still get it?
Maybe.
Why?
<i>- Yes?
You still plan to move forward?</i>
Yes, we do.
I've reconsidered.
I'm in
Good.
Well, you missed a good meal.
The lasagna came out very well, if I do say so myself.
I wrapped some up for you if you'd like some later.
You know, it gets easier.
I promise you that it does.
What you're feeling right now...
...about Ted...
Everything.
It'll pass.
When we do...
...what we do for good reasons...
...then we've got nothing to worry about.
And there's no better reason...
...than family.

Hey, Darla. How you doing today?
Hey, Dan.
I'm looking for something in a Markowski.
That'd be Dennis Markowski?
That's the one.
Oh, and I've got my paralegal with me today.
Paralegal? Coming up in the world.
You know it.
Hey, Dennis.
Have a seat.
You hear about Chow?
Yeah, people say he skipped town.
He's dead.
It wasn't me.
It wasn't a message. It wasn't payback.
It was a mistake made by a third party who has since been dealt with.
You got it?
Yeah.
Second thing.
The deal you had with Fring, it's still in place.
Okay.
Don't "okay" me.
You got something to say?
Mike, I'm keeping my mouth shut.
The laundry was right above the lab.
There's no way I could say I wasn't in on it.
I'm looking at eight years minimum.
But I'm doing my time like I'm supposed to.
I'm no rat, and you know it.
I mean, what else is there to say?
All due respect, what are we talking about here?
The deal is the deal.
How's the deal the deal?
The feds took away my hazard pay.
My wife asks me where the mortgage is coming from. I got nothing to tell her.
I knew the risks. We all did.
But that wasn't the deal.
And I know for a fact they got Holt and Perez yesterday.
Now, it's not gonna be me, but absent the hazard pay...
...sooner or later, someone's gonna flip.
No one's flipping.
Everyone gets their hazard pay, including you.
I appreciate what you're saying and all, but the man is dead.
Okay? The lab's a hole in the ground.
I just don't see it.
I've got something new.
It's just starting up. It's gonna make you whole.
Something new? With the feds looking at you?
How?
"How" is my business.
Hanging tight's your business.
Your family's gonna be fine. You will be made whole.
Now, you got my word.
You need more?
No, Mike. I'm good.
Who's next?
That's your choice.
A.P.D.'s got Martinez across town McGann's up in Sandoval.
The Sandia tribal cops are holding him for the feds.
And Holt and Perez are in lockup in Los Lunas.
You don't mean to get to them all today?
Yeah, I do.
Hey, let's go! Open up!
Back here.
Oh, hi. How was your day?
Are you moving back in?
Yeah. I'll keep the condo for now.
Selling it in this market, I'd get killed.
But, yeah, I'm home.
It's time.
Do you really think that's a good idea?
Yes.
So you bring him here? Come on.
The three of us, we're the three amigos.
All for one, one for all.
We don't need a fourth amigo.
Saul, Mike knows the business. He knows distributors.
Mike's okay.
He's okay?
He said he was gonna break my legs.
And don't tell me he didn't mean it, okay?
Because he gave me the dead mackerel eyes. He meant it.
Saul, Mike threatened me. He threatened Jesse.
He probably threatened someone before breakfast this morning.
It's what he does. Come on. Grow a pair.
Let it be noted that I do this under duress.
Duly noted.
All right. Let him in, Huell.
Mike, I'm extending you--
Now that we're all together, here are the ground rules.
Division of labour. I handle the business.
Making the stuff, that's your end.
I don't tell you how to mix your chemicals and whatnot...
...and you do not tell me how to take care of business.
Is that absolutely clear?
Sure.
All right. Let's take the tour.
Hey, you're okay with that?
Yes.
He handles the business, and I handle him.
Clearly, we're talking about renting, not buying.
You need an ongoing business, someplace you can slide in...
...do your thing and remain anonymous. I'm not gonna mince words.
This is your best bet.
Got machines running, forklifts, people coming and going.
You're gonna stay way under the radar.
And the owner's solid. He can't wait to throw up a curtain wall...
...stack some boxes in front of it, give you the space you need.
After that, he's got his business, you've got yours...
...and never the twain shall meet.
It's outstanding. Am I right?
Machines like this, gotta be plenty of power.
What about the smell?
More good news.
I've been here when it's up and running. This place stinks already.
You'll blend right in.
How many employees?
I knew you'd ask.
Sixteen illegals, all highly motivated to stay deaf, blind and dumb.
You'll want to vet them, I'm sure.
Yes, indeed.
So, what do you say, maestro?
Is it unanimous?
You know, I worked in a box factory one summer in high school...
...and I haven't seen one of these in years.
Trip down memory lane. That's perfect.
You know what this is?
It's a corrugator.
It uses steam and salt to crimp kraft paper for cardboard.
And it makes a hell of a racket doing it, which is great. Right?
No.
Steam and salt.
When this thing is running, it's like a jungle in here.
Shit. It'll ruin the product.
You can't just pop down to Costco and get a couple dehumidifiers?
What--? Fine. Fine. Moving on.
Spacious, isolated location, no humidity...
...and you get all the free tortillas you want.
That's the special feature of this place.
I don't know.
It'll make the tortillas smell like cat piss.
Somebody's bound to notice that.
All right. Well, there's gotta be some kind of workaround, right?
It's a technical problem. You guys are technical guys.
You know, be creative. Put your heads together.
Anything food-related is gonna have unannounced government inspections.
All I'm asking is that you keep an open mind.
Danny's already set some space aside behind the Skee-Ball games.
No.
Hell, no.
I know it's a long shot.
All I can say to recommend this...
...is we're talking about an owner here who is, how should I put it, highly amenable.
Look, I get it. Just say no and we'll go get dinner.
All right. So I'll start.
No way we're cooking in here.
No space, nowhere for the smell to go.
Look at that door. That thing rolls up and we're open to the world.
I don't know if anybody noticed...
...but there's a cop shop a quarter of a mile away.
The hammer comes down, it's gonna be Custer's Last Stand.
It's perfect.
What?
How are we gonna fit a lab in here?
Who said here?
A house is infested.
Termites, cockroaches, whatever.
Homeowners hire a pest control company.
Truck rolls up, homeowners leave.
The crew tents the house.
They bomb the place with poison.
The house stays like that for days.
No one looks twice at a tented house.
Now, maybe there's a strange smell coming out of it.
Does someone think to investigate? No.
Does anyone go inside? Hell, no.
And that's where we'll cook.
They tent, what, three, four houses a week?
So we pick the one that's best for us.
Enough floor space, easy access.
Once the tent is up, we go in, we cook a batch...
...we bomb the place and leave.
So we gotta move in and out for every cook?
Set up a lab, cook, and then take everything down?
It's challenging, but doable.
Tell me about these guys.
Mr. Ponytail on the sidewalk, that's Ira. He's the owner. On the roof is Sandor.
The ladder's Fernando, and down below, that's Todd.
The pest control operation is legit. I mean, they're licensed, they're bonded.
They do as good a job as anyone in town.
But they're also top-drawer second-storey men.
"Second-storey"?
B and E artists.
They're burglars.
Yeah. I mean, hey, they play it smart.
They don't boost anything while they're on the job.
They copy the keys, locate the valuables and alarms...
...and they sell that information to other crews. Or, after a decent interval...
...they'll lift the goods themselves.
And you know them how?
Oh, I've been pulling their chestnuts out of the fire, legally speaking, for five years.
Ira and his guys are good. I mean, they know how to keep their mouths shut.
And if you buy them, they're gonna stay bought.
You can check into them yourself.
I will, if it comes to that.
So do we take a vote?
Why?
We sound great.
Rock on, man. Solid.
That Yamaha's got a real nice touch.
You like the sound? It's huge, huh?
Yeah, it's real nice, but we're looking for something else today.
You got any roadie cases?
For sure. What size?
Biggest you got.
That'll fit through, like, a regular-size doorway.
You got it. Follow me.
Top of the line.
Recessed hardware, foam lining, quarter-inch laminated walls...
...3-inch casters.
Height is good, width is good. How much weight will this hold?
It's rated for 900 pounds.
So unless your band plays lead bricks, you should be okay.
We're gonna need...
Hey, man, I'm trying to do business over here, bitch.
Sorry. He's, like, overly enthusiastic.
Anyway, I'm gonna need four of them.
Four? That gonna be layaway? Because I need to see a bunch of IDs for that.
No, man, cash.
Okay. Hey, you know what?
I'll throw in stencilling. What's your band called?
Damn, brother.
Not asking no questions, but it sure looks like you're back in business.
No joke. You way back in business, man.
Look at this.
Yeah.
You're stacking the benjies till the rubber band pops.
Yeah, yeah.
All's we're saying is we know you're major league now...
...but if there's ever anything else you need from us...
Any way we can get in on this at all.
Little stuff, big stuff...
We would be all over it.
You know, maybe someday.
That's cool. I guess we better hit it then.
Yeah. Keep on keeping on, brother.
Later.
<i>Okay, it is the same job as always.</i>
You go out, you inspect, you deal with the customers, regular drill.
Everything's the same, except for one important detail.
No stealing.
No stealing.
Not a toothpick, not the spare change between the couch cushions...
...not the panties out of the hamper. Nothing. And I mean nothing.
If you're out with your buddies and they ask if you got a hot tip on a B and E...
...you tell them you got nada. You're out of the game.
The bottom line is that these houses are out of bounds, now and forever.
Got it?
All right.
From time to time, you're gonna see these two.
Now, as far as you're concerned, they are ghosts.
You don't see them. You don't hear them.
You don't say "good morning."
You don't speak unless you're spoken to.
On the other hand, if they tell you to jump...
...you don't ask what for, you jump.
Now, you need a name for them?
You call them "Yes, sir" and "No, sir".
You got any problems, you come to me.
Here's the deal. The finishing tank's a tight fit.
And with this motor you've got on top...
The agitation motor.
The agitation motor here on top, the tank's not gonna fit in the box.
It's just... It's just too tall.
You know, I thought we'd put a collar on the tank...
...and carry the motor in separately, alongside the condenser.
And on the day, we just kind of twist it into place...
...you know, while we're setting up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's good.
Yeah.
That will work.
And Joe and his guys can build it, right?
Yeah. You know, they're up for it.
Joe already bought a TIG welder for the aluminium work.
And, you know, I figure if they can pull off the magnet, they can handle this.
Now, listen, about the smell...
About keeping it out of people's drapes and furniture and whatnot...
When I was down in Mexico...
...there was this big, big, plastic hospital tent...
...they set up inside of the--
Oh, shit. Sorry.
Oh, hi. Sorry.
No, no, no. We were just wrapping up.
This is my...
Friend. Hi. Walt.
Nice to meet you.
You too.
This is Brock.
Hi, Brock. I'm Walt.
I've heard a lot about you.
Hi.
Hi.
I understand you were in the hospital.
And Jesse told me that you were very brave.
Yeah. A man of few words.
I'm sorry. He mostly just wants to play his game.
Oh, I know that.
I have two of my own. A boy and a girl.
Well, I should go.
I was thinking I could make us all some dinner.
Are you sure you don't wanna...?
Yeah. Why don't you stay for a beer at least?
Sure. Why not? A beer sounds good.
Thank you.
How are you today, sir?
We're good. Good. How are you?
Family all packed up, ready to go?
Yeah.
Here you're acknowledging that you've removed all pets...
...and plants from the house and that food has been removed...
...or double-sealed in the bags we provided.
This acknowledges you've removed or bagged any medicine, tobacco, pet food.
Better make sure you got any medicine you might need.
It's already in the car.
Okay.
Holy crap. How much poison are you using?
It's not how much, it's getting it where it's needed.
Those are your foggers.
They disperse the fumigate into the structure...
...where it'll eliminate any nymphs or larvae...
...as well as the full-grown blattodea.
So do we have all your keys?
Any extras on here you might wind up needing?
No, I'm good.
Okay.
This last one here acknowledges that you have been informed...
...that you may not reenter the premises...
...until it has cleared the post-fumigation inspection.
So you're gonna get them all, right?
We'll kill them dead. That's a guarantee.
Sir? Sir?
Yes?
There's a nanny cam in the living-room clock.
I disabled it. I just thought you should know.
What's your name?
Todd, sir.
Cheers.
You know, I've gotta say...
...seeing you with Andrea and that little boy...
It was nice.
Yeah. It's good, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And the way she looks at you...
You think?
Oh, definitely.
So is it moving in any particular direction?
I don't know. Maybe. Yeah. You know, sometimes I think...
...you know...
...if it feels right, then...
If it feels right, it feels right.
Sometimes you just gotta listen to your gut.
I mean, instant family.
What more can you ask, right?
Absolutely.
<i>Cut the cards.</i>
Have you thought about what your plan is?
You know, vis-Ã -vis honesty?
You mean how much she knows about this?
She doesn't know anything.
I mean, you know, she's not stupid. She knows I'm into something, but...
She could make a pretty good guess.
But I never told her anything.
I'm not gonna.
Okay.
I mean it.
I know you do.
Jesse, I can't pretend that this doesn't affect me. It does.
But with everything that we've been through, the two of us...
...this has to be your decision.
I mean, you've earned that.
Seriously?
Yeah.
Secrets create barriers between people.
I'm speaking from experience, believe me.
All that you've done...
...it's a par': of you, and...
I mean, if you choose to spend the rest of your life with this person...
...then you'll have to decide how much you'll share with her.
Meaning what? Like everything?
Like Gale?
I'm just trying to say that I trust you...
...and I know you'll make the right call.
If she loves you...
...she'll understand.
They're leaving streaks.
This more ethnic-looking one, he's doing a great job...
...but the other one is going back and forth like he's scrubbing a wall.
They have to go in circles...
...or you're going to leave streaks.
That's pretty basic, right?
I don't mean to tell you your business.
It's just-- It's simple quality control.
So I've got some good news.
Guess what.
What?
No, really. I want you to guess.
Marie, I really--
Okay. Hank's back at work.
That's wonderful.
Yeah.
Sure, they love him now, but where were they when he needed them?
Merkert and all the rest, they laughed him out of the office...
...when he told them about that chicken man.
As far as I'm concerned, too little too late.
If it were me, I'd tell them all to go to hell.
Do I sound bitter?
But it's what he wants, right?
Yeah, it's doing him good.
I mean, his PT is going gangbusters.
He's hardly using his cane at all.
And thank you for that, really.
I mean, God knows where he'd be if we had to go through his health plan.
I'm just glad he's feeling better.
So, speaking of which, we have another big event coming up.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do?
Walt's birthday.
Whatever you need, I'm here.
Yeah. I...
I don't think we're gonna do anything this year.
What are you talking about?
Of course we're gonna do something.
Skyler, he was diagnosed around his birthday, right?
I--
So it's been a whole year.
Listen, I've had my problems with Walt.
Why he wouldn't come to the house when we were all practically--
Whatever. Water under the bridge.
But at this point, every year is precious. We are--
What are you doing?
You don't smoke. You haven't smoked since college.
You can't be serious!
With the baby and Walt?
You're not smoking around the baby, are you? And you can't smoke here.
There's gotta be some rule or regulation, I'm sure.
You can't force your employees to breathe secondhand smoke.
I know for a fact that that is illegal.
Marie, shut up.
What? I'm sorry...
...please don't speak to me like that. I am simply saying--
Will you shut up? Shut the hell up.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!
Please stop--
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!
That's 5.23.
Five-point-two-three.
Last one.
Five-point-two-six.
That comes to 49.27.
Good yield, right?
That is an excellent yield.
All right.
Hey, Marie.
How you doing?
Where is Skyler?
In the bedroom. She's resting.
Is everything okay?
Breakdown? What does that mean?
It means I don't know what else to call it.
But I've never seen her like that, ever.
Well, what did she say when she was yelling?
Nothing.
She just yelled, "Shut up, shut up," over and over again.
Did you know she's smoking?
Occasionally, maybe. It's not a regular thing.
I just wish I had gotten your message.
Messages, Walt.
Plural. I probably called you five times.
I'm not leaving here until I know what's got her so upset.
Are you gambling again? Is that what this is?
Please, God, tell me the cancer isn't back.
No.
It's not the cancer.
Well, something happened.
I don't mean to point the finger, but this didn't just come out of nowhere.
It's time to tell me the truth, Walt. All of it.
I mean it.
You're right.
You heard about Ted Beneke?
The accident?
What accident?
A couple weeks back, Ted took a fall, a bad one.
He gave himself a concussion...
...and fractured a couple vertebrae.
He's still in the hospital.
He may never walk again.
Oh, my God. I didn't know. I'm so sorry to hear that.
Yeah.
But that couldn't explain Skyler's...
Yes. Yes, it could.
You do know, right? You...
You must know.
Oh, God.
She was having an affair.
With Ted Beneke.
Listen. It wasn't...
It wasn't ongoing or anything, and...
Skyler and I have been trying...
...to put things back together.
And then the accident happened, and she got...
Marie, I'm begging you. Please keep this to yourself.
I don't want Hank to think less of her. Or me.
When did you...?
Was she--? I'm gonna go.
Okay. All right.
Thank you.
I'm sorr--
No.
<i>That looked nasty.</i>
Hey, you okay?
I'm good.
Really?
Yeah.
<i>Come on. You wanna fuck with me? Okay.</i>
<i>You little cockroaches.</i>
Dad, wait.
<i>You</i> wanna <i>play games? Okay. I play with you. Come on</i>
This is it.
Wait. Wait for it.
<i>- Ready?
Yo u wanna play rough? Okay!</i>
<i>- Say hello to my little friend!
"Say hello to my little friend."</i>
Nice. Just--
Hey, Mom, feeling better?
Hey. Hey, why don't you join us, if you feel up to it?
We have popcorn. I think there's some pizza left.
If you're up to it.
Yeah, Mom. Join us.
Oh, my God. Look. Look.
You whores!
Everyone dies in this movie, don%they?
Okay.
For you and you and me.
Three hundred and sixty-seven thousand dollars each.
Wait a minute.
After the dealers got their cut...
...we should be looking at 1,379,560.
Mike, you're short.
You're almost 300,000 short.
You're forgetting about the mules. They get a flat 20 percent.
The what?
The drivers.
They're the ones that take the product from us to the dealers.
And so transportation is worth 20 percent?
They're taking a risk.
Two hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars' worth of risk?
What did Gus pay his mules?
Gustavo Fring didn't use mules.
He didn't need them.
He spent 20 years building his own distribution.
He had 16 refrigerator trucks running his product.
And do you know where they are now?
Government impound.
You don't like paying 20 percent? Maybe you shouldn't have killed the guy.
Hey, hey. There's still over a million bucks here, all right?
That's for one cook.
And since you're putting on the green eyeshade...
...my supplier and I came to an agreement.
The methylamine is free this time.
But brace yourself, because the next barrel is gonna cost big.
Can we continue, or you got any more burning questions?
Okay, kid.
You fronted us 120 to get us going.
So that's 40 from him and me.
One hundred and twenty.
Yes. Thank you, Jesse.
Okay.
Now, Ira gets 110 for our piece of the business...
...and <i>25</i> per cook.
That is 45...
...from each of us.
Ira's guys get 10 each per cook.
Goodman's cut, 18,000 from each.
Legacy cost, $351,000.
That's 117,000 each.
"Legacy cost"?
I got nine guys
You don't know them, but they were part of the previous operation...
...and they know a lot. And right now, some of them are in jail...
...and more will be soon. The feds RICO-ed their hazard pay.
So we are gonna make them whole.
We are gonna make them whole?
What is this "we"?
These were Gus' employees, not ours.
They might have been Gus' employees, but they're my guys.
So, what are they doing to further our interests?
The cops are looking at them very closely.
We don't want them furthering our interests.
So we are paying them, why?
Because it's what you do.
It's what you do.
My guys are keeping their mouths shut.
We make them whole.
One hand washes the other. It's as simple as that.
It sounds like a simple shakedown...
...simple as that.
We're paying for their silence. That's blackmail.
Business is my end.
This is business. End of story.
This is your problem. It should come out of your end.
Hey. Hey. Just take it out of mine.
All right? Go for it.
I don't care. Just take it.
No. Jesse, thank you...
...but no.
I'll pay my share.
Go ahead.
Let me tell you something.
This...
...is how it's gonna be from here on out.
My guys are an ongoing expenditure...
...so you best get yourself comfortable with it.
A hundred and thirty-seven thousand.
That's less than with Fring.
Listen, Walter. Just because you shot Jesse James...
...don't make you Jesse James.
Tomorrow.
How are you feeling?
Okay, I guess.
Broke it off with Andrea.
I had to.
She's gonna tell Brock.
I'm still gonna take care of the rent and stuff.
It's the right thing to do, but, you know--
I meant this.
How are you feeling about the money?
You're looking at it wrong. When we worked for Gus...
...we were cooking 200 pounds a week.
This last batch was great, but we didn't even crack 50 pounds.
We maybe cleared less money, but we got a bigger piece of the pie.
It's like you said, we're owners, not employees.
I've been thinking about Victor.
Yeah?
Yeah.
All this time...
...I was sure that Gus did what he did...
...to send me a message.
Maybe there's another reason.
Like what?
Victor trying to cook that batch on his own?
Taking liberties that weren't his to take?
Maybe he flew too close to the sun...
...got his throat cut.
Gotta say, when you first brought her in, I had my doubts.
But your little darling's got nine lives.
Rear-wheel assembly took the brunt of the impact. So...
Yeah.
CV shaft, boots, joints, axle...
Replaced all of it. No way around it.
I went aftermarket on most of the parts here.
You want me to swap in factory parts, that's fine.
But using aftermarket's the only way we'll keep it under Blue Book...
...and on the insurance company's dime, okay?
Nothing beats free.
Swapped out your air filter, topped off your fluids.
Didn't have to replace the windshield this time.
I know, right?
Oh, and I noticed you had some sort of gunky buildup...
...in the front end here.
First, I had no idea what I was looking at.
Then I remembered you had me replace...
...that front fender a few months back when you ran over that deer.
We went at it with the steam hose, cleaned it up for you.
Hardest part was the paint.
Fern green. Interesting tint.
Anything else?
That's it. Zero balance, like I said.
Sign here, you're good to go.
People like to joke...
...but I really, really like this car.
She's sturdy as all hell.
I'm betting you get another 200,000 miles out of her.
Hey, Benny.
What would you give me for it?
What's the Blue Book, you mean?
No.
I mean, what will you pay me for this car?
Well, I'm not really looking for...
A hundred dollars?
Fifty?
Insurance company just shelled out 1900 for the parts alone.
Then it's a bargain.
You give me 50 bucks, and she's all yours.
You sure about this?
Sure as shooting.
I'll check the register.
Dad?
Fifty bucks? Are you crazy?
<i>- Gotta be kidding me.
Lydia?</i>
Oh, Christ.
I'm at work right now.
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>
<i>This is a heads-up. You got visitors.</i>
Visitors? What...? You mean today?
<i>I mean 30 seconds.</i>
Come in.
Ms. Rodarte-Quayle?
Agent Hank Schrader, Agent Steve Gomez, DEA.
We met briefly in Albuquerque.
Yes, we did.
What can I do for you?
There. The foreman.
Navy pants, powder-blue shirt.
Hey, buddy.
Yeah?
They got Ron.
Ron's done.
<i>Okay.</i>
No. No.
Not okay, Mike.
Not okay. The...
The look he just gave me was the very antithesis of "okay," okay?
<i>Breathe, Lydia.</i>
<i>No one's talking to the police.</i>
I just had like 14 DEA agents...
...barge into my office, screaming and yelling at me...
...and they were swarming all over the warehouse, okay?
The warehouse.
Besides, Ron was my guy. Remember? I don't have a guy anymore.
Ron fixed security, pulled the barrels, drove the truck.
You can't expect me to do that stuff. I mean, let's be realistic.
Mike, this is crazy.
<i>I'll send a new guy.</i>
<i>You're crazy.</i>
My car almost has 500 horsepower.
It would totally smoke--
Horsepower isn't everything.
Don't you know that?
You have to factor in drag and torque and suspension...
...and weight of the car.
One more factor that you're not thinking about:
The experience of the driver. I totally got you there.
Please. Please. You drive like a geezer
I got you.
Really? I drive like a gee--
Tell me, can a geezer do donuts? I don't think so.
Bullshit you ever did donuts.
Watch your language.
And, yes, I did.
Seriously?
Yes, seriously. And if you show me...
...just a modicum of respect, maybe I'll teach you.
Yeah? Yes?
No. No, I won't. I take that back.
Yes. Yes. No. You're saying yes.
Just a joke. I'm just...
No! No, no. That was kidding.
We didn't shake on it. No.
Yes. Yes.
We are now.
That doesn't count!
I know you don't approve.
But mine...
...we'll call a birthday present to myself.
And Junior's...
People will just chalk that up as me being a softy.
And besides...
...I didn't actually buy either one.
They're both leases. So it all fits our story.
Okay?
We can afford it now.
You're back at it?
Well, yeah.
We have to make up that 600,000 we lost.
What do you think about boarding school?
Boarding school?
For who? For Junior?
Yeah. There's this place in northern Arizona...
...and it's supposed to be one of the top 10 in the country.
He's a year away from college.
Why on earth would we do that?
I... I don't know. I just...
Just thinking about the kids.
Holly too?
Where are we sending our 8-month-old?
Peace Corps?
No. I just...
A new environment might be good for them.
What does that mean?
What's wrong with their environment?
Skyler.
What's wrong with their environment?
Nothing.
Hey.
Listen, I know these last few weeks have been rough.
The threat to Hank and this whole thing with Beneke.
But there's absolutely nothing...
...for you to be afraid of anymore, okay?
I mean, clear sailing from here on out. I promise.
You know, I want us to try and start looking forward to things again.
Speaking of which, my birthday.
I don't know-- I don't know what you have planned...
...and with everything that's been going on lately...
...I'd understand if you haven't even given it a thought.
But I think...
...a little celebration might be good.
For all of us.
You know, a birthday party.
What do you think?
Yeah?
Okay.
And maybe, if I may be so bold...
...chocolate cake with chocolate icing?
Life is good, Skyler.
Thank you.
Hey, Mom, you forgot something.
Dad's bacon.
That's okay. I can do it.
No. Mom has to.
Well, it is sort of a tradition.
Watch this, Holly.
Watch what she does with bacon.
Watch. Watch this.
What is she doing? What is she doing?
That's a pretty small "1
Kind of is.
Just a little.
Now you're talking.
No. No.
Good move.
No.
No, no, no. It's good.
Very good. Family teamwork.
Making sacrifices. Very important.
Happy birthday, Dad.
Thank you, buddy.
You want some?
Guy's some piece of work, isn't he?
Six feet under and half a face, he's still screwing with us.
So, what's next?
I don't know. I don't know.
This Madrigal thing seems hinky, though, you know?
We got Burgermeister Meisterburger in Germany...
...and 5000 miles away, you got this guy.
There's gotta be someone in the middle, you know? Someone we're missing.
What about that Lydia what's-her-name?
Lady Banjo Eyes at the warehouse?
In this world? No way.
Too uptight. Too together.
Maybe.
She was wearing mismatched shoes.
How together can she be?
Gentlemen, how goes it with Fring?
You know, just working through the grief.
How soon before you submit a final?
Well, we've been kicking around some ideas.
Had you asked a couple of weeks ago...
...I'd have said this was a mop-up job, but...
But?
None of Fring's crew is talking to us.
I mean, not a peep, no matter how hard we squeeze.
Makes it likely there's somebody keeping them in line.
Our money is on this guy, Michael Ehrmantraut.
He's Fring's head of "corporate security."
He's a definite hard case.
Now, we're gonna stay on him.
We're putting together a surveillance team as we speak. Okay?
The other thing is...
This may be unrelated...
...but the blue meth is making a bit of a comeback. Tell him, Gomey.
Yeah. Some small amounts on the street-side pulls.
Lab's telling us it's the same stuff.
I mean, it could be old inventory leaking out...
...or it could be somebody's rebooting...
...using Fring's former cooks to set up a new operation.
I thought we had Fring's cooks.
The unsubs in the lab fire.
Thought maybe one of them was your Heisenberg.
Yeah. Maybe. I don't know.
Like I said, there's still a lot of questions.
Agent Gomez, could you give us a moment?
Yeah.
Hank, I gotta say, your work here has been stellar.
Really first-rate.
Thank you, sir.
So much so that I'm wondering if it's time you made a change.
You know I have to get back to El Paso.
This office needs an ASAC...
...and I'm thinking we should be promoting from within.
If you were to put in an application...
...and I recommend that you do, you will get the job.
I have no doubt this D.O. would be well served with you at the helm.
That's...
I'm not sure what to say.
It's a big step up. It's not without its headaches.
The politics may take some getting used to.
You'd be overseeing every case in the office...
...so you'd need to reassign all your day-to-days, Fring included.
Much as I hate losing a good field man...
...that's the job, and you need to be okay with it.
What do you say, Hank?
You want it?
Well, considering my wife would murder me if I said "no"...
Yeah. I want it.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Can you finish up for me?
It's... It's my birthday.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
I probably have a birthday party waiting for me, you know, so...
Yeah. Cool. Yeah, no problem.
Hey, happy birthday.
Thanks. Thanks.
Hey, Dad.
Hey.
Where's your mom?
Kitchen.
Hey.
Oh, hey.
So, what's the plan?
Hank and Marie are on their way.
Roast chicken and potatoes for dinner, rocky road for dessert...
...and chocolate cake, as requested.
What's up?
Me?
Nothing.
Thought you'd be more jazzed about the new job.
No. What...? No. I am.
Baby, I'm so proud of you.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.
Sorry, sorry.
I believe you. Just don't kill us here.
Marie, you've been moping around the last few days.
Marie?
What's up?
Marie, come on.
I'm sorry. I--
I made a promise to someone.
To who?
Who?
Your brother-in-law.
Are you gonna give me a hint at least?
It involves infidelity. That's all I'll say.
Oh, shit. I knew it.
Knew what? What did you...? What did you know?
Well, I mean, I didn't know it, but I've been, you know, saying it forever.
Walt's second cell phone, you know?
Sorry, babe, but I was way ahead of you on this one.
Way ahead of me.
Well, it wasn't Walt.
Skyler?
No way.
Hey.
Hey! There she is.
Hey! Hi!
Hey!
Hey, buddy.
Hey, pal. Welcome. Welcome. Come on in.
Happy birthday. Hi.
I'm in the centre lane going about 60.
I had no choice but to just tear butt out of there.
Just: So sweet.
Highway patrol's gonna be sweet on it too.
Gonna get their ticket quota in a month.
You'll help me out, right, Uncle Hank, now that you run the DEA?
Oh, yeah. For my spoiled-brat, car-wash-millionaire nephew?
Sure. I'll make sure you get a cell with a view.
All right.
Well, I'm out of here.
Okay.
Happy birthday.
Thank you, buddy.
Congratulations again, Uncle Hank.
Thanks.
I'll see y'all later.
All right.
Bye. Be safe.
Have fun.
Drive safely, okay?
I do.
Slow down.
Never.
A hell of a couple cars there, Walt.
Honey, for my next birthday, I'm gonna take a page here from Walt...
...and buy myself a jet plane.
Maybe I overdid it a little.
But with these new lease rates...
I mean, they're mighty attractive. Yeah.
Great dinner, Skyler.
Those were some bad-ass whipped potatoes, I'll tell you.
You have to tell me how you get all the lumps out.
How do you do that?
A potato ricer.
A ricer? You don't hand-mash?
No.
Well...
Boy, it has...
It has been quite a year, huh?
Do you know that...
...it's almost exactly a year ago...
...that I got my diagnosis?
Jesus. Yeah, right?
Yeah.
It seems like longer, doesn't it?
Yeah. No. it's...
One year ago tomorrow.
The day after my 50th.
Honestly never thought I'd make it this far.
With the cancer and surgery...
...and Hank being shot...
It just...
So many dark days.
Well...
There's Marie's talking pillow.
Remember that?
It was effective.
Boy, I did not want to get any treatment.
I think I was too scared...
...or too angry or...
I don't know. I just wanted to quit.
But you guys... You got me through it somehow.
Kept me going
And that happened again and again and again.
I mean, there were times...
...when I was sure I was done for.
But then someone or something...
...would come through for me.
God. And Skyler, I can't--
Honey, remember that first week of chemotherapy?
That night on the bathroom floor?
What you said to me?
I was so sick.
It was rough going at first.
But Skyler...
She was right there, of course...
...putting wet washcloths on my forehead.
And she's singing to me.
And this would go on and on...
...day after day.
And I remember I was lying on the floor of the bathroom...
...because the tile felt nice and cool, you know?
And my head was in Skyler's lap...
...and I was just asking her...
...if this could all be over.
It was too hard. It was...
I just wanted it stopped.
Skyler, isn't that freezing?
Hey-0. Pool party.
What are you doing, Skyler?
What is she doing? Walt?
Hey, Sky, maybe it's time to get out now.
What do you think?
Skyler, Hank asked you a question.
You need to get out... Skyler!
She's gonna come up, right?
She has to.
Skyler!
Oh, my God.
Wha...? Okay.
Okay. It's gotta be...
Nope.
Okay.
Come on! How am I supposed to--?
Hey.
Wait.
Wait, wait. Who are you?
I'm the-- I'm the guy. So where's the...?
Hold on. Hold on.
Who sent you?
Who sent me? Who do you think?
No. I'm asking you.
Mike.
And this Mike person...
What's his last name?
Lady, I just got off a plane from New Mexico...
...and I got a 900-mile drive back. That's 14 hours if I don't stop.
So the sooner we do this, the sooner it's done.
Ehrmantraut.
Okay? Satisfied?
<i>Sorry, but I'm not gonna apologise for being careful.</i>
With all that's been happening, for all I knew...
...you were one of those undercover people.
So, yeah, I'll take paranoid any day...
...over getting gang-raped by prison guards.
No doubt. So where's the--?
Up there. Number 22356.
That's the one I erased from the inventory, so it has to be that one.
Can you reach it?
Yeah, with, like, a forklift.
You got one?
Wait, wait, wait! Stop!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What?
Please tell me that's not what I think it is.
Has anything like this ever happened before?
No. No, of course not.
No, no. I just...
She and I have been having some issues.
Yeah, yeah. I might've heard a little bit about that.
I mean, hey, look, Marie didn't go into detail.
She just, you know, said that, you know, you guys were...
...having some issues.
So, what's the next move?
Might be good to have her talk to someone.
I agree.
Yeah.
I'm gonna get on that first thing.
Yeah.
There's Marie's guy, Dave.
She seems really happy with him.
Not that Marie's an advertisement for advanced mental health or anything.
You know...
I just had no idea she was taking it this hard.
Some birthday, huh?
She's gonna try and get some sleep.
Okay.
What was that?
I don't know.
I mean, was she trying...?
No, not in a swimming pool. No.
With all of us there? No, I don't think so.
But we both...
...think that she should talk to someone.
I'm gonna get you Dave's number.
Okay.
Listen, Walt, I...
I can't help but sense that there may be some issues...
...between you and Skyler.
None of our business, of course.
And, Hank, I don't know if you've...
...picked up on any of the--
He knows. He knows I know.
These things happen in a marriage...
...but it isn't unfixable.
I think what would be great is if...
...you two had some space...
...to work through this stuff.
So...
And keep an open mind here.
What if we took the kids for a while?
Took the kids?
Absolutely.
We'll look after them for a day or two, or however long...
...and leave you and Skyler...
...to look after each other.
That's very generous of you, Marie...
...but I... I just don't see how that's a solution.
And, I mean--
Besides, Junior and Holly, that's a lot of work.
No, it isn't.
Junior's independent...
...and my niece is only the easiest...
...most delicious baby that was ever born.
It'll be fun, right?
Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah. Yeah.
Absolutely. Yeah. It's a good idea.
Well, I think it's a great idea.
Just the thing for both of you.
Marie, this idea...
Was it yours?
Actually, it was Skyler's.
She really needs this, Walt.
Yep.
I gave Marie bottles.
They'll stop and pick up diapers along the way.
I spoke with Junior on the phone...
...and after much discussion...
...he agreed to swing by tomorrow, pick up some clothes. And so voile...
...the kids are out of this environment.
What a coincidence.
I know you're awake.
What was that about?
Can you explain it?
I don't want the children here anymore.
It isn't safe.
Skyler, we have talked about this repeatedly.
It has never been more safe.
"Never been"?
A couple weeks ago, a man was coming to this house...
...to kill us, to murder your entire family.
You were in the crawlspace, screaming.
And I dealt with him. It's over.
It is not.
You're right back in the meth business again.
This is different. Now I'm running things.
So wait. Now that you're in charge...
...it's what? It's gonna be smooth sailing from here on out?
I don't see why not.
I keep the work at work, Skyler...
...and nothing will ever impact you or the kids.
You don't know that. You can't make that promise, Walt.
I can promise you that Gus Fring is dead.
And he was the threat. He was the danger.
I thought you were the danger.
Is that what your pool stunt was about?
Trying to protect my children from me?
Not just you.
There's blood on my hands too.
What blood? Beneke?
He's in the hospital because of me.
No.
Because of what I did.
Skyler, you can't beat yourself up over this thing.
Please. You didn't set out to hurt anybody.
You made a mistake, and things got out of control...
...but you did what you had to to protect your family. I'm sorry.
That doesn't make you a bad person, it makes you a human being.
Stop it, Walt. Just stop.
I don't need to hear any of your bullshit rationales.
I'm in it now.
I'm compromised. But I won't--
I will not have my children living in a house...
...where dealing drugs and hurting people and killing people...
...is shrugged off as "shit happens."
We're back at it? Fine.
But the kids stay away, and that's that.
"That's that"? That's what?
I got them out of this house.
To a sleepover at their aunt and uncle's?
They spend a day or two...
...Junior stays up late watching movies, and then what happens?
We'll see.
No, I'll tell you what happens.
They come home to this house, to their parents who love them.
No. I will not let our business endanger them.
How many times do I have to say...
...that they are not in--?
I said no.
I swear to God, I won't have them back here.
What are you gonna do to stop it?
Whatever it takes. Everything in my power.
Like what? I mean, specifically.
What is your next move?
My next move is maybe I hurt myself.
Make it clear we need more time.
Let Hank and Marie see we're still struggling.
No, more like you're still struggling. So maybe next time, I have you committed.
Put you in some inpatient facility while I take care of the kids myself.
Is that what you want?
So then maybe I show up with bruises on my neck...
...give myself a black eye...
...say that you beat me...
...when you found out about my lover.
I see.
So you want to involve Ted?
Oh, well, that'll be fun...
...bringing the police up to speed on all of that.
But not as much fun as telling your 16-year-old son...
...that his father is a wife-beater.
Also not a very good plan. What else you got?
I could send Junior away to school.
Now here's the conversation:
"So, honey, I know you've only got one year left in high school...
...but I would love it if you'd drop everything...
...leave all your friends behind, and go to boarding school in Arizona."
You have any other ideas? Because I'm not hearing...
...a solution to your problem.
How are you going to save our kids from this terrible environment?
I don't...
What are you gonna do?
Run off to France? You gonna close the curtains, change the locks?
This is a joke. Come on, Skyler.
You wanna take me on? You wanna take away my children?
What's the plan?
I don't know!
This is the best I could come up with, okay?
I will count every minute that the kids are away from here...
...away from you, as a victory.
But you're right.
It's a bad plan.
I don't have any of your magic, Walt.
I don't know what to do.
I'm a coward.
I-- I can't go to the police. I can't stop laundering your money.
I can't keep you out of this house.
I can't even keep you out of my bed.
All I can do is wait.
That's it. That's the only good option.
Hold on, bide my time...
...and wait.
Wait for what? What are you waiting for?
For the cancer to come back.
Yeah?
Okay. Okay.
Just relax. I'm coming.
Look at that. You tell me what that looks like.
If the DEA's tracking her barrels, there goes our precursor connection.
That's done. And I'm telling you, these days...
...chances of getting a new methylamine hookup is rare, man.
It's like Bigfoot. Like unicorn-rare.
Kid, it's just... You're giving me heartburn here.
GPS on the bottom of the barrel.
Why didn't they put it inside where nobody would see it?
Look, it's inside, it gets wet.
They made these things to put under cars.
It can get wet.
Even by cop standards, this is sloppy.
And the other barrels...
...they have trackers on the outside too?
I don't know. Probably.
You didn't check any of the other barrels?
No. But that's the only one we could've taken according to her.
Once we spotted it, she freaked out, I put the barrel back, and we F.O.'d.
Let me ask you something.
The person who spotted this...
...was it you or was it her?
Lydia. She saw it first.
Okay.
She's dead.
Wait, wait, wait. What?
Lydia planted this thing, not the cops.
She's thinking if she makes it look like her inventory's being watched...
...that we'll leave her alone and take our business elsewhere.
And she's right.
We will be taking our business elsewhere...
...right after I leave her alone in a ditch.
But wait, hey, if the DEA's not tracking her stuff...
...that's a good thing, right? I mean, all we gotta do is tell her...
...to cut the crap and keep the methylamine coming.
You don't know this woman like I do.
I had a chance to deal with this before, and I gave her a pass.
That's what I get for being sexist.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
Mike, you can't just--
Look, that's our precursor. We need her.
Kid, if we have to ramp down for a while, so be it.
It beats working with a lunatic who's gonna get us arrested or killed.
Look, she didn't seem crazy to me, you know? She just seemed, like, uptight.
And now you're being sexist.
Trust me, this woman deserves to die as much as any man I've ever met.
Wait!
Just wait.
What if this really was the cops, you know?
And what if you're wrong about her?
I'm not wrong.
But what if you are?
Jesse, your misgivings have been duly noted.
Now move away from me.
No. This is a voting thing.
I don't think so.
I vote it's a voting thing.
Mr. White, weigh in here, would you?
What do you think?
Mr. White?
The methylamine keeps flowing, no matter what.
We are not ramping down.
We're just getting started.
Nothing stops this train.
Nothing.
Hey, yo, Mr. White. Hold up.
Hey, I just wanted to say I liked your idea.
You know, it's pretty...
I think it's the way to go.
Oh, hey.
You said it was your birthday, so...
I left the receipt in the box in case you wanna exchange it.
Anyway, hey, happy birthday.
Hi.
I stopped by Hank and Marie's.
Junior is still asking, "What is going on?"
Nonstop, very insistently.
But everything's okay.
They're watching Ratatouille.
It's very sweet.
How are you?
There's gonna be some more money coming in soon.
Is that okay?
Fine.
Good.
So...
You coming to bed?
I wanna show you something.
See that watch?
It was a birthday present.
The person who gave me this present...
...wanted me dead too.
Not that long ago...
...he pointed a gun right between my eyes, right here...
...and he threatened to kill me.
He changed his mind about me, Skyler...
...and so will you.
Hey, man, look at the sad sack I found moping around the lobby.
Hey.
Hey, there, Walt.
How you doing, buddy?
Good.
Listen, I'm sorry to drop in on you out of the blue.
No, no, no.
If it's a bad time, I could--
No. I'm just kind of settling into the new digs here. What do you think?
It is very nice.
Yeah. Congratulations again.
Yeah.
We're all very proud of you.
Oh, well, thanks.
My days of chasing dirt-balls is over.
But I'll tell you what, being a boss...
...own kind of grind, you know what I'm saying?
Steve, would you mind if... I've gotta run something by Hank, if it's all right.
Yeah. Yeah, hey, somebody's gotta go chase the bad guys.
Walt, it's a pleasure seeing you again.
Thanks again, Steve.
Appreciate it.
Sure.
Hey. Look at that.
Jesus, Walt.
That's nice. Let me see that.
Yeah.
Wow, that's beautiful.
Was it a birthday present?
Yeah.
Well, I mean, not really.
I bought it for myself.
Hey, well, have a seat.
Thanks.
New car, new watch.
Good for you.
With all the curveballs that were thrown at you this year...
...you deserve to treat yourself.
I mean, as long as you got the money to spend, that is.
So how's Sky?
Actually, she went to work this morning.
She wanted to.
She said she needed to, you know, keep her mind occupied, and...
That's good. Great, actually.
Yeah.
I mean, as long as you're all right with her being on her own and stuff.
Yeah, well, you know, I'm right there with her most of the time.
And Mariano kind of keeps an eye on her when I'm not, so...
Good.
Yeah.
And what about the whole idea of talking to somebody?
You know, Marie goes off about Dave like he's a rock star shrink, you know?
They come in like zombies, out like larks, you know what I'm saying?
That's great. Actually, she already found someone.
Yeah. Peter...
I don't know why I'm drawing a blank on his last name. Peter...
Anyway, he's out in Rio Rancho. He's supposed to be top-notch.
Good, good. I'm glad you're on it. That's not something you wanna let fester.
No. No, you don't. You don't.
Hank, I just...
I wanted to thank you and Marie for watching the kids.
No, it's-- It really is--
No, it's nice of you...
...and I'd like to come by tonight and see them, if that's all right.
Of course. What do you mean? You don't have to ask that.
It's great having them. They're great kids.
I appreciate that.
I do.
Something else on your mind there, Walt?
Walt, feel free to, you know...
Skyler doesn't love me anymore.
And I don't know what to do, Hank. I don't.
She...
She says that I'm a bad influence on the kids...
...and that I'm not...
Not good for them.
Jeez, Walt.
No.
She thinks I'm a bad father.
I'm sorry.
Hey, I mean, Sky and you got your issues...
...but that there, that's... That's...
I mean, I'm no...
I'm not an expert on parenting or anything, but from where I'm sitting...
...I just don't see it, you know?
I mean, I...
I think you're great with the kids. I think you're great with the kids.
You're a provider, a role model, you know?
Hell, the guts you showed going toe-to-toe with cancer...
...that alone, that's an inspiration to me, you know?
No, I've made mistakes, you know?
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
Listen, I'm gonna get a coffee. You want a coffee?
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
I'm gonna have a cup of coffee.
I'm gonna give you a moment to just get it together there.
You want cream and sugar?
Yeah, yeah. Hank, I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
That-- Cup of coffee, right? All right.
Just take a moment. Take a moment.
You know, you two are really great together.
Take it from me, buddy, it's always darkest just before the dawn.
Yeah.
What is this place? What is this place? What are we doing here?
Get me the table.
I can't be here.
My daughter, my little girl, she's gonna be home soon.
What? What are you doing?
Mike, Mike, Mike...
Shut up!
Give me her phone.
All right, Lydia.
My friends here don't know you like I do...
...so they are very kindly giving you one last chance.
There's your script. Study it.
In about 30 seconds, I'm gonna dial Agent Schrader on your line here...
...and you're gonna pass along this information...
...and then we'll see what we see. But here are the rules:
If you yell for help, try to give the man some kind of coded message...
...or otherwise tip him off...
...I am gonna pull out my pistol and shoot you in the head.
Same goes for panicking, breaking down into tears.
Remember how you like to do that?
If it happens this time, I am going to pull my pistol out...
...and I am going to shoot you in the head.
Look at me, not at them.
Lydia, look at me.
If you make Schrader suspicious in any way...
...any way at all, tell me what's gonna happen next.
You'll pull out your gun and shoot me.
And where will I shoot you?
In the head.
In the head. That's right.
And it's a pistol, not a gun.
I'm expecting precision here.
We up and running?
Yeah. Computer's set.
Okay, Lydia.
If you ever needed to give the performance of a lifetime...
...it's now.
You're up.
<i>A SA</i> C <i>'s office</i>
Hi. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle calling for Agent Schrader.
<i>I'm sorry. What's this regarding?</i>
Madrigal Electromotive. Lydia. Rodarte. Quayle.
Hold, please.
Hank, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle on line one.
Hank Schrader. How can I help you, Ms. Quayle?
Well, this is kind of an odd...
It's just that I was in our warehouse supervising a shipment of chemicals...
...when I noticed a device on the bottom of one of our barrels of methylamine.
A device?
Yeah. I guess you'd call it that. I mean...
...I'm certainly no expert, but it looks to me like some kind of a...
A tracking device or a GPS.
So I was just wondering if maybe your people put it there.
Not that it's any of my business, but the last thing I wanna do is interfere...
...with a law enforcement operation or a sting...
...or whatever you call it.
So, I don't know...
...maybe you could give me some guidance?
Well, I'll tell you what.
Set that barrel aside for me, if you would...
...and I'll look into it and get back to you.
And in the meantime, mum's the word, all right?
Yeah. All right. Sure thing.
<i>Okay, great. Thanks for the call, Ms. Quayle.</i>
<i>Bye-bye.</i>
Hey, Gomey, come here, would you?
Yeah?
Hey, man.
<i>You know anything about GPS trackers on a methylamine barrel?</i>
<i>Madrigal Houston, I'm talking about.</i>
<i>Nope. Nobody from my team planted anything. Why?</i>
<i>Oh, I don't know. I figured as much.</i>
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>
I know what you're thinking, but I didn't do it.
I'm telling you, I didn't plant that thing.
Shut up.
And there you have it, like I said.
All right. So now what?
It's not the DEA's, so Schrader's probably thinking some crew planted it...
...looking for a weak spot to pull a heist.
He's gonna send a team over to that warehouse.
He's gonna wire it out the wazoo. Bugs, cameras, the whole nine yards.
So the warehouse is too hot.
Her supply is useless to us now.
It depends on how fast Schrader can get his guys there.
We're 900 miles closer, after all.
I say we keep listening, suss out how much time we have.
If it's at least 12 hours, then we head down there...
...use her security code to gain access...
...and we take every barrel we can.
U-Haul can only take six or seven before the suspension gives out.
It's a stopgap. But right now, it's the best we can do.
Well, what about her?
You two drive the barrels back tonight.
I'll deal with her.
No! No, no, no. You're making a mistake.
This was not me! I swear to God I didn't do it!
I don't know. Sounds like she's telling the truth to me.
She has a gun to her head, kid.
Everyone sounds like Meryl Streep with a gun to their head.
I'm sorry, Jesse.
You're the one who wanted to put it up to a vote.
It's two against one.
No. No! You can't kill me! Come on!
I swear I didn't do anything!
<i>Janice, give me Doughty in the Houston office, will you?</i>
<i>You got it.</i>
<i>Hank Schrader for Mr. Doughty.</i>
<i>He's on the line.</i>
<i>Hey, Erol. Please tell me you guys didn't do something as lamebrained...</i>
<i>...as put a GPS tracker on the outside of a barrel of methylamine.</i>
<i>One earmarked for the Madrigal warehouse in Houston?</i>
<i>Who's asking? Did someone find them?</i>
<i>Jesus. Are you shitting me? Since when do you put a GPS tracker...</i>
<i>- ...on the outside of a barrel?
We didn't have time to go in...</i>
<i>...with hazard suits, Hank. They were about to ship.</i>
<i>We epoxied them to the bottom. They were well-hidden.</i>
<i>Oh, really? Well, not well-hidden enough. How many barrels you tag?</i>
<i>All of them. All the ones headed to the warehouse, anyway.</i>
<i>Christ. All right. Well, sit tight. Let me figure out how to play this.</i>
<i>Next time, a little communication first, all right?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
Asshole.</i>
Aside-- Aside from the fact...
...that we almost killed this woman, all of those barrels are already marked.
We solve the problem we can.
This has not changed the equation one iota for her.
Oh, come on! You are not seriously still considering killing me?
I saved you! If it weren't for me, we'd all be in jail right now.
I hate to say it, but she's right, Mike.
She saved our asses by finding that thing.
She is saving herself. She's a loose cannon.
I am telling you, she will turn a gun or a badge on us the first chance she gets.
The woman put a hit out on me.
Seriously?
Wait. A hit? What? Like the mafia?
Yeah, like the mafia.
Hey! You still need methylamine, don't you? Right?
You wanna talk methylamine?
Then tell your partner to stop threatening me, and let's talk.
Talk about what? You heard.
You can't even get us a single barrel.
Who said anything about barrels?
I'm talking about an ocean of the stuff.
Just give him a minute, would you?
Trust him.
"Trust him."
Okay. So, let's hear it.
Not without a guarantee that once I tell you how to get what you want...
...I won't be killed anyway.
Fine. You have my word.
Not good enough.
Look, lady--
Do you have children?
That has nothing to do with this.
It's not a trick question. Why don't you just answer it?
Yes, I have children. So what?
You think that somehow because we're both parents...
...that I won't let my partner do what's necessary?
Swear on their lives.
Oh, what?
Swear on your children's lives that I won't be harmed.
Otherwise, how can I trust you?
Look, you're a smart businesswoman.
You understand the concept of leverage.
Please don't patronize me. I hate that.
You have none.
But trust has to work both ways, Lydia.
Is it true that you put a hit out on Mike?
Yes.
Why?
I was scared.
Of Mike?
Not at first.
There are men who used to work with Gus Fring in custody now.
Nine of them. They know everything about me. Everything.
Some of them even know about you, assuming you're the master chemist...
...they're always talking about.
And if it's these nine that you're worried about...
...why put the hit on Mike?
I had no choice.
I'm not going to prison and have my daughter raised in a group home.
Do you have any idea what those places are like?
I gave him a list of names...
...but instead of handling it, he's protecting them.
So I hired someone else. At that point, there was no option...
...but to add Mike to the list.
This ocean of methylamine...
...that you claim you can get your hands on...
...how much are we talking about, literally?
How does 24,000 gallons sound?
Once a week, on a Wednesday, a freight train leaves the Port of Long Beach...
...loaded with industrial chemicals.
There's always at least one tanker car full of methylamine...
...which we import from a manufacturer in Guangzhou.
The train travels east through Arizona...
...stops at a rail yard outside Flagstaff...
...where it gets broken down and rebuilt. But the methylamine always moves on...
...destined for our pesticide concerns in Texas and Oklahoma.
Which means that it passes right through your home state.
There's a remote three-mile stretch here in McKinley County.
That's where you do it.
That's where we do what exactly?
Get your methylamine.
Like, rob it? Like Jesse James?
You want the stuff?
I'm offering you enough to fill a swimming pool.
You are offering us a quick trip to prison. That's what I'm hearing.
Stopping a train, post 9/11?
You have any idea how many alarms that'll set off between here and D.C.?
None, if you do it right here. If a freight train is stopped in transit...
...anywhere other than the usual yards or depots...
...absolutely, a signal will alarm the FRA and the TSA Surface Division...
...at the Department of Homeland Security. But what you don't know...
...and I do, because my job requires me to keep track of my buyers' shipments...
...this is dark territory.
What's that?
Train-speak for an area of no contact.
It's a dead zone.
No automated supervision system no alarms, no contact with control.
What about cell phones?
Crew could just call the cops.
No cellular either.
I'm telling you, it's the perfect place.
You'd have time enough to stop the train...
...siphon off as much methylamine as you can carry...
...get away before the police are called.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Assuming we can stop a moving train...
...how do we know we have the right one? And which tanker car is which?
I can't believe that they would advertise their contents.
Once the train gets rebuilt in Flagstaff...
...a final manifest gets uploaded to my company's server.
I'll have it for you sometime between midnight and <i>2</i> a.m.
That'll give you at least six hours of lead time.
Keep in mind, I'm taking a huge risk supplying this information.
I expect to be paid.
We can talk percentages later.
You know what this means, don't you?
We've gotta off the crew.
How do you figure?
If we don't, the engineer's gonna call the cops...
...as soon as he gets out of the dead zone. It's only three miles long.
We're way out in the boonies.
I don't care if it's in the Gobi Desert.
Once they get word, the FBI and Homeland Security...
...are gonna swoop down with choppers on us so fast, it'll make our heads spin.
And there is no hiding in that open country.
How many in the crew?
Just two.
An engineer and a conductor.
Assuming there are no security guards.
No guards. It's not like we're carrying nuclear warheads.
Wait. Two guys.
Can't we just tie them up or something?
And then what? Even if we wear a mask, we're leaving two witnesses behind.
Bottom line, I have done this long enough to know...
...that there are two kinds of heists:
Those where the guys get away with it...
...and those that leave witnesses.
Give me a break. You guys were gonna murder me.
I thought you were professionals.
Can you say "ASAC"?
"ASAC." Can you say that?
Say, "ASAC Schrader."
If those turn out to be her first words, I will beat you with my shoe.
Don't listen to him, Holly.
I'm just telling it like it is, babe.
Boss man. I'm the boss man.
Say, "Boss man."
Am I the boss man? I'm the boss.
Hey, that better be something from a boob instead of some fake soy crap.
Yeah, yeah.
My little girl...
Your little girl.
...deserves the real McCoy.
No. See?
Okay.
She doesn't want it. No, she wants me.
She wants me.
Yeah, my little girl, because I'm not giving her back.
Yeah, I know.
What about Emo McGee?
Has he come out of his room today?
Barely.
When he does, he barely talks.
Yeah, well, what do you expect, you know?
His parents treat him like he's a baby there.
Flynn, do you want me to heat up some of that lasagne...
...to hold you over till dinner?
No.
Hey, I picked up <i>Heat</i> on Blu-ray. Wanna watch it with me later?
No. And you can keep talking about me now.
Well, if no one else is gonna offer an opinion, I will.
We do it the old-fashioned way.
We hit skid row, the Crystal Palace, all the halfway houses...
...scrounge up about a dozen skells, put them to work smurfing cold pills.
You mean switch back to a pseudo cook.
You're the chemist. Admittedly, it's gonna cut down on our output.
Like a factor of four or five.
It also means that we will eat $80,000...
...we just invested in our new lab equipment...
...which is only good for a P2P cook.
You know, I don't have to do the math to know...
...that we'd be making a fraction of the profit.
And making less money is better than making nothing.
Oh, yeah, Mike? Well, why don't you tell us why?
Why is making nothing not an option?
Walter--
Let me tell you why.
It's because of your nine guys in lockup, right?
You broke it, you pay for it. And we've talked about this plenty already.
Well, maybe we better talk about it a little more...
...because what it sounds like you're telling me, Mike, is that from now on...
...we have no choice but to do this piddling pseudo cook...
...so that we can pay back your guys.
Or else what? Or else they're gonna rat on us, and we end up in prison.
Yeah? And it sounds like what you're telling me, Walter...
...is that you wanna do this heist...
...even if it means killing a couple of innocent men.
That what you want?
You know, I don't know why you insist on putting words in my mouth here.
What if we can rip off that train, and no one ever knows it got robbed?
Maybe.
Just maybe.
It'll come from that direction.
Seven seventy-five.
Eight hundred.
Eight fourteen.
Wait a minute.
It's perfect. Yeah, we do it here.
We do it right here.
How are we looking, Mike?
All clear.
<i>Copy that.</i>
Go down, go down.
You got it. That's good, Fernando.
Hey.
This one.
Right.
You good?
Yeah.
What's your name again?
Todd.
Todd, on the day, are you gonna be able to make this climb?
Yes, sir. I'll be ready.
All right.
You mind if I ask you a question?
No. Go ahead.
Well, I get why we want the tank for the methylamine.
But why this other one for the water?
Well...
Jesse, it's your idea.
You wanna fill him in?
It's all about the weight, yo.
The tanker we're gonna hit gets weighed when it gets loaded in Long Beach...
...and then again when it's unloaded in Texas.
If the weights don't match...
...the train company's gonna know it got robbed.
Okay.
Boosting methylamine from a train is, like, a major rap.
The point is, no one other than us can ever know that this robbery went down.
Nobody. You got it?
Yeah. Absolutely.
Are you sure?
Yes, sir.
With all that said, the whole thing relies on us...
...replacing the weight of methylamine we steal with the same weight in water.
So they'll never know we hit them. Cool.
Aqueous methylamine is water-based, yet it weighs slightly less than water.
We will be removing a thousand gallons of methylamine from the tanker car...
...but replacing it with about nine-tenths of that volume in water...
...which comes to 900.24 gallons.
Actually, Jesse, let's make that an even 920...
...to account for spillage and whatever will remain in the hose.
Yeah.
How we doing, by the way?
Eight fifty. We're almost there.
All right.
Won't they figure they got robbed, getting watered-down methylamine?
Well, out of 24,000 gallons...
...it'll only amount to about four percent dilution, so...
But, yes, you're right. They will notice.
At which point, they will blame China...
...for sending a marginally weaker batch.
Damn, you guys thought of everything.
Flynn.
Flynn, open the door.
Just come out and talk to me.
I'm staying. That's all I have to say.
What's going on?
You got what you wanted, that's what.
Congratulations.
It's me. Open up.
Come on, Junior. I'm not gonna ask twice.
What?
You know what.
Are you seriously kicking me out of my own house?
Are you seriously doing that?
We are not kicking you out of anywhere, son.
We love you. And this is your house as much as it is ours.
But your mom and I need some time alone, and you know that.
We explained that to you.
You haven't explained jack shit.
You want me out? Explain to me why.
Why do I have to go to Uncle Hank's?
Give me the exact reason or I'm not going anywhere.
This is not gonna be a debate.
What's going on?
Why can't anybody tell me anything?
I want one good reason.
Because we're your parents and you're our child.
That's reason enough. Now, please, do as I ask.
Now.
It'll pass. He'll understand.
Don't start, Walt.
I won't change my mind about you.
Even
Well, I don't accept that. You're my wife.
I'm not your wife, I'm your hostage.
But since you insist on keeping me imprisoned...
...I'll make you a deal.
I will launder your money, I'll keep your secrets...
...but the kids will stay at Hank and Marie's...
...where they have a chance of being safe.
I think you've seen too many movies.
Our children are not in danger.
Just a couple of days ago...
...you told me that a man held a gun to your head.
You said it like it was a point of pride.
There's nothing you can say that'll convince me...
...there won't come a day that somebody will knock on that door...
...looking to harm you or me or all of us.
And when that day comes, the children cannot be here.
You agree to that...
...and I will be whatever kind of partner you want me to be.
Okay.
By the way...
...you're visiting a therapist from Rio Rancho. Peter.
Last name is up to you.
Out burying bodies?
Robbing a train.
<i>- Yeah?
It's me.</i>
I've got it.
Okay, Mr. White, everything's set.
Hey, Wallace! Up ahead!
Stop the train now!
S'[Op!
Stop the train!
Now. Go, go, go.
Jesus. Thank God you guys weren't asleep at the switch.
It'd be like pancake city out here.
Man.
Hey, you believe this?
I mean, shit fire and save the matches.
Talk about bum luck.
Hey, man, I'm sorry to put you guys out like this.
What's the trouble with it?
No clue. I was just driving down the road.
All of a sudden, the old cow just bellied up and died on me.
Either one of you guys know about engines? Oh, of course you do.
That's why they call you an engineer, right?
All right.
Think it's...
Think it's in there or something.
You think?
Yeah.
Probably a pretty good bet.
When was the last time you changed the oil?
I don't know, man. I just drive it.
Now. Go, go, go.
We're on.
Good?
Yeah.
Go!
It looks good up here.
Now, hold up. There it is.
I think this is the one.
We good?
Yeah.
Hey, you wanna get in there, give it a whirl?
All right, let me give it a try.
Ready?
Ready.
Nothing?
Try again.
Nothing.
All right.
Maybe if we all pushed?
All right. It's worth a try.
Any other ideas, you just shout them out.
Not at the moment, I don't.
You coming?
So far, so good.
Give me a status.
We're at 300 gallons and counting.
Water is going...
Now.
Water's going in now. We're going with water now.
Good?
Yeah.
All right.
One, two, three.
You did remember to put it in neutral, right?
Yeah, man. Give me a little credit.
You sure you're not out of gas?
I got a full tank here.
Yeah, this doesn't make any sense. Everything looks good.
Why don't we just keep going over it?
There's gotta be something loose somewhere.
Damn, buddy. Picked a hell of a place to break down.
I know, right? Crazy. Hey, you know anything about engines?
Not a whole lot. I can push you off the tracks at least.
Gee, I wouldn't want you to mess up your ride.
I'll go slow. Won't get a scratch.
You'll screw up your nice shiny bumper.
Hey. We're running late because of you. The man said it was no problem.
Come on already. And thank you, by the way.
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely, pal. Thanks.
Jesus. Walter, we've got a Good Samaritan on the scene.
You pull your guys off that train right now.
We're not done yet.
The track is clear, Walter. I said get out of there.
Thank you, mister. Much obliged.
Glad we could work that out for you.
Yeah, no problem.
You want a ride into town?
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.
Walter, they are back in the locomotive.
<i>If you do not abort right now, you are gonna get us all busted.</i>
Ready?
Yeah.
Mr. White!
Hey!
Hold it! Hold it steady!
Now!
Close it off! Close it off!
Todd! Get off! Get off!
Yeah, bitch!
We did it.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, my...
Okay, okay. Nice job.
Yeah!
No! No! No!
No.
You guys didn't tell me this stuff smells like cat piss.
Man, shit happens, huh?
I mean, I'm sorry, but I had to do it.
Obviously, I guess you see it different.
Some of you. But I didn't see any other choice.
I've been thinking about this all day, going over it in my head...
...and it was the only way.
Well, it's not like I wanted to.
The kid was on a dirt bike. He could've just...
He could've gunned it and been gone before we even had a chance to blink.
We never would've caught him. I thought on my feet. I saw a threat...
...and I took care of it.
A threat?
The kid was waving at us.
He wasn't going anywhere. He was saying hi.
Yeah, but you don't know that.
Yeah, I do.
He didn't know what he'd seen.
I didn't want to take that chance.
The whole point of this was no one was supposed to know we were there.
People weren't supposed to know anything got robbed.
How could we let the kid go?
He made us. If I hadn't done what I did, the mission would've failed.
I'm real sorry.
I really am, but I...
But did I make a mistake, Mr. White? Because to me, you know, respectfully...
...I was looking out for the team. I didn't want to kill him.
You gotta believe that.
At the end of the day, it was him or us, and I chose us.
And I would do it again.
Okay, look.
Todd, why don't you step outside for a few minutes so we can talk this through?
Of course. Yeah, you guys talk.
But I just want to make sure that you know that my priority is this business.
Okay. That's fine, Todd. Thank you.
I want to be a real part of this.
All right? If you could just see that. I'm motivated and I've got connections.
My uncle's got his hookups in prison...
...who I think could be a real help to us if...
Okay. That dude? Wack job.
Let's just stick to the facts here.
Facts? Oh, okay.
How about the fact that he shot a kid?
A kid that he didn't need to shoot.
Well, the boy had seen us.
And, no, it didn't look like he knew what he was seeing.
But what if he told somebody?
What if he just mentioned it in passing?
We can't know what someone--
Exactly. We can't know, because Ricky Hitler there shot him.
We, us three, should've had a discussion about it.
We would've figured it out.
But that dickhead just went ahead and made the choice for us.
Is that how we do business now?
I understand you're upset.
And what was that crap about his uncle with the prison connections?
It's just some bullshit intimidation move. Come on.
It's true, though. He does have some connections.
Is this a problem?
No. It's nothing to be concerned about.
It came up in the background I did on him.
Didn't worry me then. He's just flexing.
All right.
It seems to me that we have three options here...
...and none of which are ideal.
One, we fire Todd.
Yeah.
I'm not a fan of this option...
...seeing that he knows way too much about this business at this point.
And we'd most likely have to pay him to keep quiet.
And God only knows we've got enough of that going on.
Two:
We dispose of him.
Which leaves us option three.
We keep him on payroll.
Put him back on tenting houses, setting up the lab and so forth.
We keep him close. Under our control.
Now, option three would be my choice.
Shall we vote?
I vote three, kid.
You're still in.
Right on. Thank you so much. You guys totally made the right--
The next time you bring a gun to a job without telling me...
...I will stick it up your ass sideways.
You understand?
Yes, sir.
Hey, boss. What's up?
I was just in the neighbourhood. Anything going on?
No. He's just hanging out with his granddaughter.
Well, isn't that sweet?
Here, let me see.
It's a dead drop.
What?
A dead drop.
He just stashed something underneath that trash can.
Write the time down. Roll on it.
Looks like he's leaving.
Anybody coming for it?
Nope, not that I can see.
Nobody in sight. Could be hours.
Could be.
What do you want to do?
<i>It's not my fault that Murtha's got his panties in a twist.</i>
<i>It's an HR issue, Janice.</i>
<i>I read the report.</i>
<i>I'm calling again because that's the wrong case file number.</i>
<i>All right? I don't know what kind of shoddy stan--</i>
<i>First off, Miracle Whip is not mayonnaise, okay?</i>
<i>"Looks like it" doesn't equal "tastes like it. "</i>
<i>Secondly, every time it's like they gotta slather an entire</i> jar--
<i>--bastard's screwing with us now. How'd he make you? What'd you do?</i>
<i>We honked our horns and yelled "yoo-hoo. "</i>
<i>What do you mean, what did we do? This guy is slippery as hell.</i>
<i>He's been throwing every tail we put on him.</i>
<i>- The guy's a pro.
Yeah, well, even pros make mistakes.</i>
<i>One of these days, our pal Ehrmantraut's gonna slip up.</i>
<i>Just gotta be there when he does.</i>
Teenagers. Sometimes you just want to strangle them.
How's it going?
Oh, you know. Well, this little munchkin, I could just keep her forever.
She is just the sweetest little baby ever born.
Yes, she is.
I don't see much of Flynn.
That car of his keeps him pretty busy.
Yeah.
More importantly, how are you doing?
I'm okay.
How's the therapy?
I know Dave helped me so much when I was going through my little...
How's your guy'?
Peter.
Peter.
He's... Yeah, he's good.
I feel like I'm making progress.
That's great.
You know, you just keep working through it.
Honey. Babe, what is it?
It's okay. It's all right.
Why don't you let me take Holly, and then we'll talk about this?
No.
Okay. All right, that's fine.
Then how about you just talk to me?
Just tell me what's going on.
I just...
I need to make the right decision.
I need them to be safe.
The kids?
They're safe. Of course they are.
I just miss them so much.
I just want to be with them.
Hey, you know we can bring them back home anytime you want.
No. They need to stay. But I just...
I don't know what to do here. I...
Like, whatever I choose is wrong.
Skyler, you gotta tell me what's going on.
I know sometimes you--
I know you think I have a big mouth sometimes. I...
But if you felt like you couldn't talk to me, I don't know what I'd do.
Okay. So, what's this about the kids not being safe?
Safe from what?
From us.
From Walt and me.
Like what? Like you're bad parents?
Because you're not. Not even close.
Marie...
...there are things you just don't know...
...that if you knew...
...you'd never speak to me again.
Try me.
Okay, if you're not gonna say it, I will.
Skyler, you have to forgive yourself for Ted.
What?
You can't keep beating yourself up...
...over some stupid little affair.
Walt told you.
Please don't blame him.
I practically forced him to, and I wasn't gonna say anything.
But I cannot stand to watch you torture yourself like this.
You have to forgive yourself, Skyler.
You were having all these problems with Walt.
And Ted is a really good-looking man.
You're only human. Hell, I've even thought of, you know...
I mean, not seriously, but I totally get your temptation.
Yeah.
Doesn't it feel good to get it off your chest?
Oh, yeah.
I feel better.
Yeah.
<i>For those who love the taste but not the price...</i>
<i>...there's simulated caviar made of kelp, a type of seaweed.</i>
<i>A fraction of the cost, it looks, smells and tastes similar to the real thing.</i>
Ready to get back at it?
<i>Unlike fish caviar--</i>
<i>We have breaking news into our newsroom.</i>
<i>We've just learned that police are now expanding their search...</i>
<i>...for a missing McKinley County boy after four days with no leads.</i>
<i>Fourteen-year-old Drew Sharp was last seen by his parents Thursday morning.</i>
<i>Authorities are extending their search today...</i>
<i>...east from Crownpoint to Hospah and Whitehorse.</i>
<i>Sharp was last seen riding his dirt bike into the desert behind his house.</i>
<i>Investigators are asking</i> any--
Jesse, nothing can change this.
Yeah, it's just that kid's parents...
I know. Believe me.
I haven't been able to sleep the past few nights just thinking about it.
But, Jesse, now, finally, we're self-sufficient.
Finally we have everything that we need...
...and no one to answer to except ourselves.
And in a year, year and a half...
...once we've cooked through this methylamine and made our money...
...there will be plenty of time for soul-searching. Until then...
...we keep going.
And we run our business our way...
...and make sure that this never happens again.
Okay?
Look.
Listen, I'll finish this up.
Why don't you go on home?
You sure?
Absolutely.
Yeah. I'll take care of this.
You go on.
Hey.
Yeah, I was just leaving.
All right.
Hello? Walter?
What are you doing here?
I'm delivering the batch. What are you doing here?
Might as well get this over with. Come in. Join us.
Hey.
Hi.
Where's your cars?
We parked around the block.
You might consider doing that as well.
Okay.
So, what's going on?
Just since this morning, I threw three separate tails. All DEA.
What?
The feds have been all over me.
This has been going on for a while now.
Did they follow you here?
No. I said I threw them.
I would never come to the headquarters of our illegal meth operation...
...dragging a bunch of cops, Walter.
It would be unwise.
How can you be so sure?
Well, I've been doing this a long time. It's pretty basic stuff.
How long has this been going on?
Since about the time we started this little venture.
The DEA, in particular your peach of a brother-in-law...
...has taken a keen interest in my activities.
And you're just telling me this now?
What, you didn't think this information would be of interest?
Wouldn't be germane?
I've been handling it, Walter.
We're sitting on a thousand gallons of stolen methylamine.
Jesus! How can you be so irresponsible?
Calm down, would you, please?
I can't believe that you kept this from me. From us. Did you know about this?
Mike just told me.
And I said calm down.
I've got it under control.
Oh, well, forgive me...
...for not having complete confidence.
You know this can't go on, right?
Yeah, I know.
And I've already decided.
I'm out.
Okay. Well...
Sorry to see you go, Mike.
But I really don't see any other way.
Neither do I.
Obviously, Jesse...
...you'll have to take over the distribution end of things.
Mike, I trust that you'll bring Jesse up to speed on your side of the business?
Yeah, about that...
Actually, Mr. White...
...I'm out too.
You're what?
I don't think I can do this anymore.
So...
...I'm retiring, I guess.
That methylamine that we stole, that we nearly killed ourselves trying to steal?
That methylamine, when cooked, is worth nearly $300 million.
And you're telling me that you're willing to walk away from that?
We're walking away from the meth.
Not the methylamine.
Jesse and I will be taking our two-thirds and selling it.
I've got a connection, a guy I knew from my time with Fring.
This guy has the capital, and he's motivated. Highly.
Mike's thinking we'll clear like 5 million. Each.
I'll pay off my guys in lock-up out of my share.
And those legacy costs you're so fond of you won't have to worry about anymore.
And then I will be going on my way.
Jesse too.
It's a solid plan.
You can come in on this with us.
That'd be cool.
Course, you know, you are free to hold onto your third...
...and keep cooking.
You'll be selling to my competitors.
This guy and his crew are way out in Phoenix.
It's a big country, Walter.
Whole lot of meth-heads.
Pennies on the dollar, Jesse.
And that's what you're gonna sell out for?
Pennies? Why?
Five million isn't pennies.
It's more money than I've ever seen.
And when it comes down to it...
...are we in the meth business?
Or the money business?
Relax, kid. There's no one there.
You sure?
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
Glad to see you could make it out.
I was surprised to get your call.
Good surprise, I hope.
There's one gallon, as discussed.
You take that back home to your people, test it.
If you're satisfied, I can get the other 665.
All right. That's fair enough.
Shall we talk money?
That one's free.
The price for the rest is 15,000 per.
Six hundred and sixty-five gallons, that's 9,975,000.
Although I would prefer you round it up to 10.
Makes it easier for my partner and I to split.
Steep.
We good?
I'll talk to my guys, but I should be able to put together that cash, yeah.
Good.
I gotta tell you, this is worth it just to get that blue stuff of yours off the market.
The blue stuff will be off the market, right?
Now, this whole time, I was thinking 666...
...that seems like an odd number.
Two-thirds of an even thousand, though.
When I look at it that way, it starts to make sense to me.
That's not all the methylamine, is it?
You two have a partner you haven't mentioned?
This other party wouldn't be a problem for you.
His territory won't impact yours.
You see, that doesn't work for me.
I'm not just buying this for the supply. I'm buying this for the demand.
I'm looking to increase my market share.
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
I want you to tell me that Fring's blue will be off the streets.
All right. Here's a new deal for you then.
I'll pay you 15K a gallon for the full thousand gallons.
Not a drop less.
It's not mine to sell, Declan.
Well, then, no deal, Mike.
Yes?
Yes. I guess.
I don't know.
Why don't you come over here?
To my house.
Yes, seriously.
Hey.
Yo, you sure this is okay?
She's not here. Nobody's here.
All right. So...
Something's come up.
Mike wanted to come here to give you the hard sell...
...but I figured it'd be better coming from me.
Mike's connection won't buy mine and Mike's shares...
...of the methylamine unless he gets your share too.
He wants the entire thousand gallons.
Absolutely not.
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.
But I've been thinking about it...
...and it really makes sense.
Kind of.
It does, does it?
Look, when you started this thing...
...did you ever dream of having $5 million?
I know for a fact that you didn't.
I know for a fact all you needed was 737,000...
...because you worked it all out, like, mathematically.
Look, if selling the methylamine now means that no one else ever gets killed...
...then I vote for that, man. Hands down.
And we could have it tomorrow. We would be out.
Spend time with your family. No more worrying about them getting hurt...
...or finding out about everything. Isn't this what you've been working for?
I have not been working this hard just to sell out.
It's not selling out.
Yes, it is, Jesse.
I have-- We have suffered and bled, literally, for this business.
And I will not throw it away for nothing.
I don't know how else to say it, Mr. White.
Five million dollars isn't nothing.
Jesse, have you heard of a company called Gray Matter?
No.
Well, I co-founded it...
...in grad school with a couple of friends of mine.
Actually, I was the one who named it.
And back then, it was just-- Oh, it was just small-time.
We had a couple patents pending.
But nothing earth-shattering.
Course, we all knew the potential.
Yeah, we were gonna take the world by storm.
And then this...
Well, something happened between the three of us.
And I'm not gonna go into detail.
But for personal reasons I decided to leave the company.
And I sold my share to my two partners.
I took a buyout for $5000.
Now, at the time, that was a lot of money for me.
Care to guess what that company is worth now?
Millions?
Billions, with a "B."
Two-point-one-six billion as of last Friday.
I look it up every week.
And I sold my share...
...my potential, for $5000.
I sold my kids' birthright for a few months' rent.
This isn't the same thing.
Jesse, you asked me...
...if I was in the meth business or the money business.
Neither.
I'm in the empire business.
I don't know.
Mr. White, is a meth empire really something to be that proud of?
Skyler, you remember Jesse.
Jesse, this is my wife, Skyler.
Hey, Mrs. White. Good to see you.
You have a lovely home.
I was just heading out.
Why don't you stay for dinner?
No, Mr. White. I'm gonna go.
Stay.
Come on. It'll be fun.
It's okay with us, isn't it, Skyler?
We don't have anything special planned tonight.
Yeah.
Sure.
Why not?
See?
These are great green beans, Mrs. White.
I like that you got the slivered almonds going.
My mom always made them like that.
You put lemon in there too?
They are from the deli at Albertsons.
Well...
...you know, good work on your shopping then.
Because these are choice.
I eat a lot of frozen stuff.
It's usually pretty bad.
I mean, the pictures are always so awesome, you know?
It's like, "Hell, yeah, I'm stoked for this lasagna."
And then you nuke it, and the cheese gets all scabby on top...
...and it's like you're eating a scab.
I mean, seriously, what's that about?
It's like, yo, whatever happened to truth in advertising?
You know?
Yeah, it's bad.
So, hey, how's business?
The car wash. Mr. White said it's going really well.
Says, like, you're a great manager.
He did, huh?
Yeah, he says you've got it running like a...
Like a machine. Like, well-oiled.
Yeah.
What else did he tell you about me?
Oh, you know, just good stuff.
Just really, you know, really good, good stuff.
We don't really talk that much about...
...you know, personal things.
Did you also tell him about my affair?
May I please be excused?
You know my kids are gone?
Thank God.
No. I don't mean they're out for the night.
They're gone. They're staying with my in-laws.
She made me kick my own kids out of the house.
She told me...
...that she was counting the days until my cancer came back.
My wife is waiting for me to die.
This business is all I have left now.
It's all I have.
And you want to take it away from me.
I thought you might try something stupid.
Look, Mike--
Don't bother, Walter.
Come join me in the office.
I don't think so.
That's not a request.
Might as well get comfortable. This deal's going down tomorrow.
It's happening, and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
Got it?
So it's okay for you to steal my--
To ensure that, you and I are gonna spend...
...the rest of the night together in this office.
Like it's my birthday.
Mike...
When the deal is done, you'll get your money. I guarantee that.
Let me cook it. I'll double your five and you still walk.
You know, I have never seen anybody work so hard not to get $5 million.
Mike, you need to listen to me.
No, Walter. The last thing I need to do is listen to you. Now, sit down.
All right.
Walter, I've got a bit of a quandary here.
I've got something I need to attend to before this deal happens.
But for some reason, I don't trust you alone with the methylamine.
I'm gonna have to restrain you.
You gotta be kidding.
Stand up for me, please.
Stand up.
Turn around for me.
Arms out to the side. Up.
Oh, man.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Give me your wrist.
<i>30")'-</i>
Alrighty. To what do we owe the pleasure?
Well, gentlemen, we're here to discuss your illegal harassment of my client.
This should be good.
Mr. Ehrmantraut has become the subject of a vicious, relentless...
...and unwarranted DEA persecution.
Gomie, does that sound right to you?
I have no idea what he's talking about.
Play it as cool as you like, Fonzie.
But we all know you've been following my client day and night.
The man can't spend a few minutes with his granddaughter...
...without you guys quivering in the bushes...
...and peeping through your binoculars. It's... Well, it's disturbing.
And it's taken a toll on his mental and physical well-being.
Your client looks fine to me.
Well, some hurts only show on the inside.
Now, you guys don't even have warrants for these tails, do you?
Theoretically, these tails you refer to would be...
...within the bounds of the law.
We don't need a warrant to follow somebody through a public place.
Theoretically.
Yeah, that is theoretically correct.
However, I would counter that an open-ended, unrestricted surveillance...
...like this amounts to stalking.
Which is illegal.
Now, I don't know what it is you find so interesting...
...about my client, and I'm not here to judge.
Different strokes and all. But sadly, he's just not that into you.
So I have filed for a temporary restraining order...
...against the DEA on behalf of Mr. Ehrmantraut.
Where'd you get your law degree, Goodman?
The same clown college you got that suit?
You know who likes this suit? Judge Papadoumian.
She thinks I'm a snappy dresser.
You know what Judge Papadoumian hates?
Police harassment of a senior citizen.
<i>30")'-</i>
Expect a visit from the sheriff, agents.
You should have your ex parte within the hour.
Let's go.
<i>What kind of judge would issue this thing?</i>
<i>Papadoumian, man. She's like Ho Chi Minh</i>
<i>So, what do we do?</i>
<i>Well, not a lot of choice, you know? We back off.</i>
<i>For the moment. TRO won't stand up and Goodman knows it.</i>
<i>I don't see what they're playing at here, but if Ehrmantraut wants a fight...</i>
<i>- ...he's gonna get one.
All right.</i>
That was a hell of a gamble.
Worked.
Yeah, well, not for long.
And he's right about that TRO. It's gonna get tossed <i>tout de suite.</i>
Meanwhile, Schrader's hard-on for you just reached Uncle Miltie proportions.
So have fun with that.
How much time I got?
Maybe 24 hours.
It's enough.
It better be. Whatever you got planned, you best pull the ripcord...
...while you still have a chance.
Where is it?
Mike...
Mike!
Get out of my way.
You sit down.
Mike! Mike! Hold on, okay?
I am gonna count to three.
Mr. White's got an idea. Mike, I'm serious.
One. Two.
It's a great idea.
Look, you get your 5 million, we both do, and he gets his methylamine, all right?
Just hear him out.
Is that true, Walter?
Everybody wins.
ï»¿1
There.
That's them.
Your play, Walter. You're on your own.
Looks like you're about 1000 gallons light here, Mike.
Where's the juice?
The methylamine isn't coming.
Why is that?
And who the hell are you?
I'm the man who's keeping it.
What the hell's this?
We had an agreement, right? We got our deal.
So where's the tank, Mike?
Mike doesn't know where it is. Only I do.
And you're dealing with me now, not him.
Why don't you just cut to what it is you want...
...or what you think is gonna happen here, all right?
Because we're gonna get what we came for.
That 1000 gallons of methylamine is worth more in my hands...
...than it is in yours or anyone else's, for that matter.
But I need distribution.
Distribution.
That's right.
So if you agree to give up your cook...
...and sell my product instead...
...I'll give you 35 percent of the take.
Thirty-five percent?
Wow, are you kidding me? Thirty-five--
Mike, please tell me this is a joke.
Know how far we had to stick our necks out to get our hands on this cash?
Why the hell would we want you? You know we have our own operation, right?
I know all about your operation.
See, my partners here tell me that you produce a meth...
...that's 70 percent pure, if you're lucky.
What I produce is 99.1 percent pure.
So?
So it's grade school T-ball...
...versus the New York Yankees.
Yours is just some tepid...
...off-brand, generic cola.
What I'm making is Classic Coke.
All right. Okay.
So if we just waste you right here right now...
...and leave you in the desert...
...then there is no more Coke on the market, right?
See how that works? There's only us.
Do you really wanna live in a world without Coca-Cola?
My partner tells me that your crew...
...switched to a P2P cook because of our success.
You dye your meth with food colouring to make it look like mine.
You already ape my product at every turn.
But now...
...you have the opportunity to sell it yourself.
I need you to listen to me.
We're not gonna give up this deal...
...to be your errand boys, do you understand?
For what?
To watch a bunch of junkies get a better high?
A better high means customers pay more.
A higher purity means a greater yield.
That's 130 million dollars of profit...
...that isn't being pissed away by some substandard cook.
Now you listen to me.
You've got the greatest meth cook in A-- No, the two...
...greatest meth cooks in America right here, and with our skills...
...you'll earn more from that 35 percent...
...than you ever would on your own.
Yeah. So you say.
Just wondering why we're so lucky.
Why cut us in?
Mike is retiring from our crew...
...so his share of the partnership is available...
...if you can handle his end, distribution...
...and if you give him 5 million dollars of the 15 million that you brought today.
Just think of it as a finder's fee for bringing us together.
We have 40 pounds of product ready to ship, ready to go.
Are you ready?
Who the hell are you?
You know.
You all know exactly who I am.
Say my name.
Do what? I don't have a damn clue who the hell you are.
Yeah, you do. I'm the cook.
I'm the man who killed Gus Fring.
Bullshit. Cartel got Fring.
Are you sure?
That's right.
Now, say my name.
You're Heisenberg.
You're goddamn right.
I gotta hand it to you, Walter.
Hey.
I appreciate the kind words...
...but I'm out too, remember?
I know. We'll talk.
Maybe we should talk about how and when I'm gonna get my 5 million dollars.
And we will do that.
Absolutely.
It's just, you know--
Look, Jesse, just give me some time here, okay?
I'll need help getting things up and running during this transition.
You can at least do that for me, right?
Come on. Don't worry. We'll figure it out.
Well, I guess that's it.
Parting thoughts, of which I have two:
First, as I said...
...I'll handle the legacy costs out of my end...
...so you won't have to worry about my guys anymore. Second, the bug.
The DEA will do a sweep. Can't say when, could be anytime.
But you need to get it out of there, sooner rather than later.
All right.
That's it?
No "thanks for the 5 million dollars," no "sorry for chaining you to a radiator"?
Just get the bug, Walter.
So, hey.
I guess
I guess I'll see you around.
No. Don't think so.
When I'm out, I'm out.
Well, I'm out too, Mike.
Kid, just look out for yourself.
Are we good?
You tell me.
Okay, Jesse. Back it up.
You're good. Keep it coming. Straight back.
Slow it down.
All right. That's good.
Hey, Mrs. White.
"Vamonos."
I Wish.
All right. Let's get this thing hooked up.
Walt.
What is this?
Do you really wanna know?
Why are you hiding it here?
Don't worry about it.
Who are you hiding it from?
I said don't worry about it.
From the police?
Or someone else?
Someone who would kill for it?
Why don't you go back in the office?
Why don't you go back in the office and let us do this?
We'll get it out of your hair.
What'd you bring me this time?
They're bacon banana cookies.
Is there bacon in these? Oh, my God!
Just bits. Just little bits of bacon.
Just enough to make those suckers really pop.
Dan, this is too much.
I'm not sharing those.
Bad office etiquette? I don't give a crap.
They're mine.
They're yours to do with as you please.
Good, because my husband's not getting any either.
How is Mickey?
Don't get me started.
He wants to buy a boat.
I can't even get him to start the lawnmower...
...and he wants to buy a boat.
I don't know. A boat might be nice.
A little one, maybe.
Oh, please. Where would you even take a boat?
All the way down to Elephant Butte?
Or Caballo. It's beautiful down there.
You can even leave it at the lake if you don't want to haul it.
We're not buying a boat, I'll tell you that right now.
And the last one is 545.
569.
Dang it. I almost got them all that time.
Very good.
But actually, I've got an extra one for you this week. 603.
603. Where is that?
Right down there.
All right. I'll let you get to it.
Thanks, Dot.
Young Kaylee's gonna need a second safety deposit box...
...if you decide to leave one more dollar to her.
How's the rest of it?
Oh, it's empty, as usual.
The families are pretty reliable with the pickups.
Nobody complaining about wanting it all at once?
No, they get it. Slow and steady wins the race.
So I guess this is it for a while?
Don't worry about the families.
They'll keep getting their deliveries.
<i>I know times are tight, but it's for the kids...</i>
<i>...and your sponsorship would sure be appreciated.</i>
<i>Yeah, we have a silver level, but the gold and platinum levels...</i>
<i>...really get your name out there on the banners and T-shirts.</i>
<i>Sure. No, that's not a problem. You call me directly if things change, you hear?</i>
<i>Gomey, take a brick to my head if I ever have to make another Fun Run call.</i>
<i>I'm done.</i>
<i>What's up? Why you smiling?</i>
<i>Because the Ehrmantraut warrant just came in.</i>
<i>Now we're talking. How quick can you get your group together?</i>
<i>- Two, three hours.
Make it two.</i>
<i>We're gonna nail that son of a bi--</i>
Police! Search warrant!
Police! Search warrant!
Coming. Hold your horses.
Search warrant.
Police! Search warrant!
Police. Search warrant.
Police. Search warrant.
How's that restraining order working out for you?
If you want me to read that, I'm gonna need my glasses.
<i>Too bad you had to make the trip out from headquarters, sergeant.</i>
<i>From out of bed, you mean. When a cop kills himself, they want a full report.</i>
<i>Just to say hello to who's in charge of the Record Bureau.</i>
<i>A single contact wound.</i>
<i>Powder burn on his temple and right hand.</i>
<i>Suicide, I'll bet you.</i>
<i>- Tell the wagon boys they can have him.
Yes.</i>
<i>When I found him, he was... He was dead.</i>
Hey! Perfect timing.
Just about to get started.
You know, if you can get going on that settling tank...
...that would be a huge help.
We left that stuff in there too long after the last cook.
Mr. White--
I mean way too long.
Now we have a tremendous amount of residue.
You know what we need to invest in is a power washer.
Mr. White, can we just take a second and talk about all this?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Yeah.
Look, you know what I think we need to talk about?
Is doubling down.
Doubling down?
Cooking 100 pounds a week, not 50.
As in starting a new lab, a lab that you'll run.
A cook all of your own.
Why not? You deserve it.
You're every bit as good as me.
Well, what do you think?
Mr. White, I think that nothing has changed for me.
I just wanna get my money and get out.
Jesse, this...
What we do...
...being the best at something...
...is a very rare thing.
You don't just toss something like that away.
And what, you wanna squander that potential?
Your potential? Why?
To do what?
I don't know.
Well, think.
To do what, Jesse?
I'll-- I'll figure it out, all right?
Look at you.
What have you got in your life, huh? Nothing. Nobody.
Oh, wait. Yes.
Video games and go-carts
Mr. W--
And when you get tired of that, what then?
And how soon will you start using again?
Look
Look, I know how upset you are about what happened to this boy.
I am just as upset as you are.
Are you? Really?
How can you say that to me? Jesus!
I mean, I'm the one who's the father here.
What, do I have to curl up in a ball in tears in front of you?
Do I have to lock myself away in a room and get high to prove it to you?
What happened to that boy is a tragedy...
...and it tears me up inside!
But because it happened, what, am I supposed to just lie down...
...and die with him? It's done!
It makes me sick that it happened...
...just like everyone else who has died in our wake.
What Todd did...
...you and I have done things that are just as bad.
Yeah.
All the people that we've killed, Gale and the rest.
If you believe that there's a hell, I don't know if you're into that...
...but we're already pretty much going there, right?
But I'm not gonna lie down until I get there.
What, just because I don't wanna cook meth anymore, I'm lying down?
How many more people are gonna die because of us?
No one. None.
Now that we're in control, no one else gets hurt
You keep saying that, and it's bullshit every time!
No.
Always! You know what?
I'm done, okay?
You just give me my money, and you and I, we're done.
Okay.
Why?
Why do you want this money?
Because it's mine. It's my cut.
But isn't it filthy blood money?
I mean, you're so pure. You have such emotional depth.
No, no, no. You shouldn't touch that dirty money.
I'll save you from that, Jesse.
Come on.
You want it.
You want it just as much as I want it.
And it's not wrong to want it. Okay?
So stay and work with me...
...and you can make ten ti-- Twenty times as much.
Whatever, man.
You don't wanna pay me, I don't care.
Yes, you do.
It's on you, all right?
I'm done.
No, you're not.
You're not done. You're not leaving. Because if you leave, you get nothing!
Do you understand me? Nothing!
Jesse!
<i>Budget for the current fiscal year for electronic surveillance...</i>
<i>...is 1.5 million, on par with ATF and the Marshal Service...</i>
<i>...but still just a fraction of FBI totals.</i>
<i>We're lobbying Congress for an additional 1.41</i>
<i>...but we're waiting on action reports to demonstrate...</i>
<i>...we 're actually getting worthwhile results. Our undercover operations...</i>
<i>...reap the most successful actionable intelligence...</i>
<i>...if you refer to the chart in Appendix 4.</i>
<i>If ASAC Schrader can tell us about the surveillance man-hours.</i> . . <i>.</i>
<i>Hank?</i>
<i>Hank?</i>
<i>Hank!</i>
<i>I think we're going to wrap this up.</i>
<i>If ASAC Schrader can stay behind while everyone else clears out.</i>
<i>Thank you, everybody.</i>
<i>You know no one wants...</i>
<i>...to see you succeed at this more than me, right?</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.
I know how good you are.</i>
<i>I wouldn't have stuck my neck out to get you here if I didn't.</i>
<i>But you're not knocking down doors anymore, bubba.</i>
<i>You're in charge of a district office, and that comes with responsibilities.</i>
<i>I mean, Hank, basic reports aren't being filed in a timely manner.</i>
I'll work on it. It'll get better.
<i>Yeah, it will, because way too much time and money...</i>
<i>...is being spent on the Fring case, a case which is essentially over.</i>
<i>All this overtime to surveil Michael Ehrmantraut?</i>
<i>That's just money that could be better spent elsewhere.</i>
I understand, but I'm not making these choices lightly.
We've got increased reports of blue meth on the street...
...Fring's gang is still operational, and Ehrmantraut is involved. It's that simple.
<i>I believe you. But so what?</i>
<i>It's one case out of dozens, and you don't play favourites...</i>
<i>- ...with it because it used to be yours.
I really think--</i>
<i>Don't play favourites. You got a bigger job than that.</i>
<i>I mean, forget the financial cost.</i>
<i>I hear you're personally serving search warrants out in the field?</i>
That was an error in judgment. Won't happen again.
<i>You're damn right it won't. I'm just gonna bottom-line this for you.</i>
<i>The surveillance budget for Ehrmantraut is now zero. We clear?</i>
Sure. Thank you.
Clear.
Good.
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>
Yeah?
Hey.
Hey.
So Ramey wanted to catch up with you?
Talk sports and stuff, I guess?
Yeah, something like that.
No more following Ehrmantraut.
Not worth the financial investment.
Well, it's not like the guy's going anywhere.
He's not even bothering to throw our tails anymore.
He's just living a boring old-man life like he has nothing left to hide.
And none of Fring's crew is talking?
Not giving an inch.
You sweeten the pot enough?
Zero jail time and an all-expense-paid trip to Maui?
Not that, but close. Nobody wants to bite.
Christ!
They're either the most loyal crew in history or someone's paying them off.
You still checking bank records?
No one living beyond their means.
Nine perps, all being represented by one lawyer.
Not unusual in a case like this.
Yeah, this guy, what's his name? Daniel Wachsberger?
He represents every one of these douche bags except for Ehrmantraut.
Can we find out more about the lawyer?
You want me to start tailing a lawyer?
Like the shit ain't deep enough for you already.
Ramey said we couldn't follow Ehrmantraut.
He didn't say anything about anybody else.
Do it.
You're the boss.
All right. Shall we get started?
Now, I know that most of this, or all of this, is gonna be new to you.
But did you take chemistry in high school?
Just basic?
No.
Okay. That's all right.
As we go, I'll be as detailed as possible without being overwhelming.
Yes, sir.
Look, Todd, I don't need you to be Antoine Lavoisier.
What I do need is your full effort and attention.
Listen and apply yourself.
If you do that, then we just might have a fighting chance here, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Well, here we go.
Slowly. Steady.
The aluminium helps speed up the delivery of hydrogen chloride.
Gently pour it in. Don't spill it.
<i>You're gonna like the little Schticky, but you're gonna love the big Schticky.</i>
<i>For bigger messes like dust bunnies...</i>
Now...
...the CO2 freezes the liquid...
...crystallising it...
...which gives us our finished methamphetamine.
Now all that's left...
...is to break it up, weigh it, and we're done.
Wow, this is...
This is complicated. It's gonna take me a few more times to get a grasp on it.
Oh, yeah. It'll take a few more times.
I do all right?
You did fine, Todd.
You applied yourself. That's as much as I can ask.
Now all that's left, I guess, is to talk money.
We can talk money once I get this right.
Morning. Guess what I have.
Cake pops. They're balls of cake on a stick.
Very nice. Thank you, Dan.
See? I put little faces on them.
Hey.
Hey.
All right.
I'm working with a new guy now.
And I think that it...
I think it could possibly work out...
."because""
I'm trying, Hank. I really am. I'm trying, but there's... There's...
I mean, it's like I don't even exist to her.
Well, yeah. Yeah.
I mean, I know she's struggling. I know, but I just don't know what to do.
I mean, what can I do?
Such a mess.
I mean, we-- Both of us...
...we just have screwed up so much.
I'm just...
I'm sorry. I don't-- Do you have any coffee?
Maybe I can--
Coffee? You bet. Yeah, you bet.
What, you take cream, right? Yeah.
Yeah.
All right. Here you go, buddy.
Oh, thank you, Hank.
Yeah.
Look, I'm sorry to waste your time...
...with all this.
No.
It's, you know-- But it's-- You know.
Yeah.
Hey.
Oh, hey.
Hey, could you excuse me?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.
Tell me something good.
You tell me.
Sweated the guy for 14 hours. That should be some kind of record.
Quit your bragging. What'd you get?
He's gonna do it. He's gonna flip.
He's willing to give us Ehrmantraut?
What are you wasting your time for? Throw a net around that son of a bitch.
All right.
<i>- Yeah?
Mike, hey, it's me.</i>
Can you <i>talk?</i>
I can.
<i>Great. Look, there's a small situation with the money.</i>
<i>I don't wanna do this on the phone. Are you available?</i>
I can come by in a few hours.
<i>That's not good for me. Where are you now?</i>
I'm at the park with my granddaughter.
<i>Where exactly?</i>
Palomita.
<i>Oh, you know what? I'm not far. I'll come to you. You just hang tight.</i>
Yeah?
Mike, they're coming for you.
<i>- Right now. They're coming.
Slow down, Walter. Who?</i>
<i>The DEA. The DEA-- Somebody ï¬ipped.</i>
<i>They have some kind of bank surveillance.</i>
<i>And something about some lawyer.</i>
<i>Someone is talking, Mike, and they're coming for you right now--</i>
How could Mike use that clown of a lawyer?
Dan Wachsberger.
He would've had better luck with the law firm of Moe, Larry and Shemp.
Always consult with me before using outside counsel.
All right, Saul, enough, please. Instead of just sitting around here...
...what can we do?
Besides pray that he gets away...
...I'm open to ideas.
Because if the DEA catches up with him...
...and he flips, it's good night, John-boy.
No. No way Mike would ever flip, okay? No way.
Yeah, yeah. Never say never.
This is the second time the DEA has confiscated his bankroll.
You know? Jesus, fool me once, right?
Look, he won't flip.
But his nine guys will.
Hey. It's him.
Mike, I got you on speaker phone with the brain trust.
The <i>what?</i>
The... Walt and Jesse are here.
<i>I don't want Walt and Jesse, Saul. I want you. I need your help.</i>
What do you need?
I got a go-bag at the airport.
Passports, money, but there are eyes everywhere.
I can't get close.
I need you to pick up that bag and get it to me as soon as possible.
Do you know how thick the crap storm is out there?
Told you not to use that lawyer. He's a hack!
Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.
Hey, Mike, I can get it to you, all right?
Just tell me what to do.
No, <i>kid.</i> Not you.
I'm paying Saul. He can do the job just fine.
Yeah, you're paying me, and the DEA knows I represent you...
...so they're probably sitting on my car right now, hoping I do something stupid.
Mike, I can do it, okay? It's not a problem.
No, Jesse.
Jesus, I'll do it.
Besides, you're out, remember?
Mike, tell me where to get this bag.
Hello, Walter.
Before I hand this over, I need something from you.
And what's that?
The names of your nine men.
Why? You're never gonna pay them off. What's the point?
The point is, Mike, it affects me.
It affects Jesse too. And we deserve to know.
The only thing left to do now is leave town. You understand?
"Leave town."
Yeah, I just can't up and leave like you, Mike.
I've got a family, I've got people who depend on me.
Yeah.
Goodbye, Walter.
You're welcome!
I'm sorry, what?
I want those names, Mike. You owe me that much.
I don't owe you a damn thing.
All of this, falling apart like this, is on you.
Oh, that's some kind of logic right there, Mike.
You screw up, get yourself followed by the DEA...
...and now suddenly, this is all my fault?
Why don't you walk me through this?
We had a good thing...
...you stupid son of a bitch! We had Fring. We had a lab.
We had everything we needed, and it all ran like clockwork.
Oh, my God.
You could've shut your mouth...
...cooked, and made as much money as you ever needed.
It was perfect. But, no, you just had to blow it up.
You and your pride and your ego!
You just had to be the man.
If you'd done your job, known your place...
...we'd all be fine right now.
I just...
I just realised that Lydia has the names. I can get them from her.
I'm sorry, Mike.
This... This whole thing could've been avoided.
Shut the fuck up...
...and let me die in peace.
Mr. White?
Hello?
Mr. White, the car's been dealt with, sir.
No one tailed you?
No, I stayed off the main streets and kept checking, so...
Joe ask any questions?
I told him RV job, just like you said and he totally knew.
It's pretty cool the way they do that. They just turn a car into a cube.
So should we deal with this other thing now?
Yeah.
Sure.
I don't want to talk about this.
Okay.
It had to be done.
Okay.
All right.
I need to talk to you.
In private.
So, what's the story?
You get to Mike?
He get out safe?
He's gone.
All right.
Well, what about those nine guys in jail?
I mean, they got no reason not to talk now.
So, what do we do?
We"? Who's "we"?
There is no "we," Jesse.
I'm the only vote left...
...and I'll handle it.
My client will supply information relating to the organisation...
...distribution and production of Fring's methamphetamine enterprise.
We expect all charges to be dropped, and Dennis not only walks out of here...
...a free man, but also receives blanket immunity.
For what he'll be furnishing, this deal is plenty fair.
Best I'd be willing to do is queen for a day and reduced charges.
All charges dropped.
Queen for a day and a five-k. That's the best you're gonna get.
No way. Guys, come on.
You can be a fairy princess, for all I care.
Where you going?
Shopping for someone who can tell me something I don't already know.
Hey, he)'
I got plenty you don't know.
You seem a little confused.
This here is a buyer's market.
I got eight other assholes just like you, four of them within 100 feet from here.
I also got Dan the lawyer, who'll give me the money and Ehrmantraut.
So settle in, Dennis. Enjoy your new home.
I'm gonna go rattle some cages.
So?
Maybe you should order something.
Do you want a coffee or something?
Not just now.
I think this would play better if you ordered something.
I think this will play just fine, and I'm not thirsty.
So let's take a look at the list.
Lydia, you've come all this way. You do have the list?
Yes, I have it.
Good.
It's just not written down.
And why is that?
It's in my head. Safer there.
I see.
Then I suggest you pick up a pen.
Not just yet.
It was my understanding that attending to these nine names...
...was precisely what you wanted.
Ten names now. Ten, counting the lawyer.
Yes. Ten, counting the lawyer.
So, what, am I not tying up loose ends for our mutual benefit?
You're tying up loose ends, and I don't wanna be one of them.
I give you that list, I've served my purpose.
Then maybe I'm just one more person who knows too much.
So you put that list in my hands, and in your mind...
...I immediately just murder you, just right here in this restaurant?
No. Not right here. Of course.
Here in this public place, immediately?
That is not--
Listen, Lydia.
You made me promise on my children's lives that I guaranteed your safety.
From Mike.
You guaranteed I'd be safe from Mike.
There's no way he'd ever go for this, you getting rid of his guys.
You wouldn't be doing this, the names, if Mike were still a factor.
Yeah. That's what I thought.
What do you want, exactly?
Because if you don't want to give me that list...
...then I've truly got no use for you.
I can grow your business exponentially.
Just give me the list.
I can do that by helping you expand into a larger...
...highly active, highly profitable marketplace.
What do you know about the Czech Republic?
The Czech Republic?
Did you know there's a higher demand for meth there than anywhere in Europe?
Five percent of its 10 million people...
...which is roughly the population of the Southwest...
...from western Texas to Phoenix, are using meth.
You keep your market here, but by adding overseas sales...
...you can more than double your current profits.
And I checked. The average purity is only about 60 percent.
They've never seen anything like your product.
You'll blow their hair back.
Shipping internationally seems like courting disaster.
Not if you're Madrigal.
Madrigal is under investigation by the DEA.
The restaurant division, mostly.
We've got 46,000 employees spread across 14 divisions.
And once Mike's people are no longer a factor, things should tidy up nicely.
This is what I do, you understand?
Move things from point A to point B all over the globe.
One-point-two million metric tons a month...
...and all of it right at my fingertips, a laptop click away.
The Czech Republic...
Who's on the other end?
People I ship to regularly.
People I've worked with for years. Professional and very amenable.
I'm very careful who I work with.
And if this is such a slam dunk, then why didn't you pitch it to Fring?
I did. He said yes. We were in the final stages of working it out...
...when somebody killed him.
You don't think Gus Fring built his distribution network all by himself.
There are considerable advantages to diversification of distribution...
...like putting 6000 miles between you and your product.
At 25 pounds a week, I'm estimating you'll gross about 2 million.
Give me 10 pounds to start, and we'll see how it goes.
All right.
Now, with Fring...
...my end was gonna be 30 percent, which I believe is more than fair.
Okay.
Trust me, if you do this--
Lydia, learn to take yes for an answer.
Now, first things first.
Shake on it?
We're going to make a lot of money together.
Todd, I think it's time I meet your uncle.
No iron pile.
There's too many muscle-heads flexing their shit. Too many eyes.
Okay, so no chow line, no yard.
Well, gonna keep it simple.
Pass-byes.
Yeah. Hallways, shower room, cells.
The easy stuff.
I say we go with a riot. Our boys get it done in a riot.
No, no, no. No chaos.
I don't want the goon squad rolling in and stealing our shot, you know?
This has gotta be fast and quiet.
Just boom, boom, boom.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Surgical.
Surgical. That's what it's gotta be.
So how many guys we got at MDC?
Three, counting Shattuck. And he makes the schedule now...
...so we can put who we need where we need them.
All right. So MDC's covered. What about the rest?
We need G block in Valencia, right?
Our guy's on the night shift.
Have him pull a double.
No.
His supervisor's got some hard-on about OT.
Have him switch with somebody. Just get it done.
Regardless, you know, we got enough guys in Valencia right now?
Might have to hire out.
You high? Mix blood with chuntaros?
No way.
No.
There's no need. We got enough.
Hitters ain't the problem. It's that short walking window after lunch.
Yeah. It's gonna be tight.
Real tight.
I gotta be straight with you, man. Taking out all these guys is doable.
But hitting them in three separate jails all within two minutes?
I mean, whacking bin Laden wasn't this complicated.
Where do you suppose these come from?
I've seen this one before.
I wonder...
...are they all In some giant warehouse someplace?
Hey.
It can be done, just not the way you want it.
It can be done exactly how I want it.
The only question is, are you the man to do it?
Figure it out.
That's what I'm paying you for.
Yo, what's going on, man? What's that alarm?
What's happening?
What are you doing, man? No, man, please!
No, man! Help me!
Help me! Help!
Help me!
Ball came in my direction, batter wouldn't even bother running.
Excuse me a second. Couple more photos.
Yes?
<i>It's done.</i>
<i>New details have emerged in the spate of jail deaths...</i>
<i>...that rocked central New Mexico three days ago.</i>
<i>As of yet, no names of victims have been released...</i>
<i>...but authorities continue to investigate what appears to be...</i>
<i>...a carefully coordinated sequence of attacks...</i>
<i>...that occurred within minutes in three different correctional facilities...</i>
Is it okay if I turn this off?
Oh, sure.
I don't want the news on right now.
Hank just pulled up, and he's not in the best mood.
Oh, all right. I'll get out of your hair.
Okay.
Hi, honey.
Dinner will be in about an hour.
And I thought we could have that chicken you like.
Or we could order Chinese.
Sure.
Here we go.
That fun? Play with your toys?
I'll see you in a little bit, okay? See you in a little bit.
Hey, Hank. I was just getting ready to leave.
Something to drink?
Yeah, sure. Thanks.
Perfect.
Hi.
Rocks, right?
Rocks, yes.
Been thinking about this summer job I used to have.
Oh, yeah?
Back in college, I'd spend my days...
...marking trees in the woods with this...
This orange spray can.
Marking trees?
Yeah. Crews would come in later...
...and find the trees I tagged and cut them down.
First, you go in and you mark locations for skid trails and landings.
Then you choose specific trees all within a selected grid.
Every day...
...I'd go back...
...hike in...
...pick up where I left off.
Oh, it sounds nice...
...being out in the woods all day.
No, it wasn't so great.
I got sunburned. There were mosquitoes.
I just wanted to make a few bucks. Buy beer.
Been thinking about that job more and more lately.
Maybe I should've enjoyed it more.
Tagging trees is a lot better than chasing monsters.
I used to love to go camping.
This way.
Here, baby girl. Come see your brother.
There you go, sweetie. That's it.
Oh, my God! Look at her go!
Good job! Good job!
Over here. Peekaboo. This way.
Let's go see your brother. Let's get him.
Where'd you go? I can't see you. Where'd you go?
There you are!
You're really good with her.
Come here, my baby girl.
You're gonna be a handful, aren't you? Yeah.
Mama's gonna get her exercise.
Hey, do you wanna watch a movie?
Hey, Louis.
One moment.
Nothing. What's up?
Oh, Well.
It's so nice to see you smile again.
I mean, you seem good.
Yeah. I'm hanging in there.
To see you laugh like that just now...
It's such an improvement, don't you think?
I don't-- I don't really...
We've been thinking...
...Hank and I, that it may be time...
...to take the kids home.
It's been almost three months, right?
Almost three?
Does Hank not want--?
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, God. No. No.
Hank's crazy for these kids. You know that.
It goes without saying, we love having them.
And we're always here for you...
...and wanna help you any way that we can.
But...
We're starting to worry...
...that maybe...
Maybe we're enabling you.
Sweetie, you've had a lot on your plate...
...and you and Walt have had a lot--
So much to contend with.
I'm so proud of you for going to therapy. You know that, right?
It can be so helpful, such a good tool.
And I'm very, very proud of you...
...but I--
We...
Maybe at this point...
...the best way to help repair the family...
...would be to repair the family, you know?
Take a drive with me.
Here. I'll get it.
Walt.
This is it.
This is what you've been working for.
I rented this place and I started bringing it here because...
...I didn't know what else to do.
I gave up counting it. I mean, I had to.
It was just so much, so fast.
I tried weighing it.
I figured one bill of any denomination weighs a gram.
There are 454 grams to a pound, but...
There's a variety of denominations, so...
How much is this?
I have no earthly idea.
I truly don't.
I just stack it up...
...keep it dry, spray it for silverfish.
There is more money here...
...than we could spend in 10 lifetimes.
I certainly can't launder it, not with a hundred car washes.
Walt...
...I want my kids back.
I want my life back.
Please tell me.
How much is enough?
How big does this pile have to be?
Shit!
Hi.
Hey.
I hope I'm not disturbing you or anything.
I tried calling, but--
Yeah. No, I tossed all my burners.
And you didn't answer your home line.
It's disconnected.
Well, unplugged.
I mean, did you leave a message, or...?
No.
So, what's up?
No, I was just in the neighbourhood, so I thought I'd drop by and say hello.
You wanna come in, or...?
Sure. Thanks.
You know, I'd offer you a beer or something...
...but, you know, I'm out.
No, no. No, I'm fine, thanks.
You didn't wind up moving, I see.
Didn't have to.
Saul told me what you did.
Anyways, I'm not in jail.
You aren't either, so there you go.
There was no other option, Jesse. It had to be done.
I'm not coming back.
I know.
So why are you here, exactly?
It's funny, I...
I saw a Bounder the other day.
Bounder?
Yeah.
Our RV? A Bounder?
Oh, you saw the same one as ours?
Yeah. Well, I mean, within a couple of years, I guess.
Early '80s.
It was certainly in a lot better shape than our old hunk of junk.
Much nicer paint job.
No bullet holes in the door.
Yeah. That thing was a nightmare, huh?
Yeah. It was primitive.
You know, whenever I hit a red light, I used to pray...
...it wouldn't crap out on me.
Yeah.
And then, suddenly, it would sometimes have that...
That screeching sound just out of the blue...
...like we hit a pack of cats.
Power-steering belt. That's what that was.
You know, I always had this...
This whole system.
Strategy to not let it idle too low.
Remember that time we ran out of gas coming back from a cook?
The gauge. It always said half-full.
You walked three miles with a jerrican while I waited on the side of the road...
...praying the whole time that no cop would show up...
...no Good Samaritan.
God.
We had money.
Why'd we keep it?
Why did we have to have the world's shittiest RV?
Inertia?
Yeah.
Inertia.
So, hey, you know, I gotta get going.
Me too.
I'm meeting friends.
I gotta get going as well.
I left something for you.
Hey.
I'm out.
I'm out.
With some big earrings, it could be really nice.
Perhaps some big hoops.
l do indeed.
I feel like I want to mix it up with my hair this summer.
I don't know, like colours--
I don't know. Coins.
Did you have a coin collection? Did you?
I've heard it's very therapeutic.
Coins and baseball cards. Those were the ones.
You can play around with it, take them in and out.
Not enough hours in the day, right?
There's not enough hours.
My hairstylist told me...
...to take prenatal vitamins.
For your hair?
He said they work, so I figured why not?
Oh, Flynn, could you put some more sunscreen on Holly?
Yeah. Is it over there?
Yeah, it's right here.
Okay.
Especially for a home brew, though.
Paba-free. That's good.
I don't know why it would be bad.
Yeah. Me neither.
Oh, do you--? I used to squeeze lemon juice in my hair.
You remember that?
You wanted to be a beach bum so badly.
I did.
You and your stiff hair.
Stiff? Whose stiff y? What?
Hey, hey.
I was interested to see you get into that.
It's like chemistry.
Borage oil is supposed to be good.
Better than flaxseed?
I don't know.
That's cool. I like your style.
There is no Christmas.
Maybe I should brew up a batch.
Schraderbrau?
Yeah.
I vote yes.
I second that.
Well, there you go. It's unanimous.
Well, who am I to fly in the face of public demand, right?
All right.
Anybody want anything? You want anything?
No, I'm good. I'm good, thank you.
Yeah? All right.
Does it look glossier?
Do I have a halo?
How's she doing?
She's good.
Yeah? Try not to put any of the sunscreen on her fingers.
<i>"To W.W. My star, my perfect silence. "</i>
W.W.
I mean, who do you figure that is?
Woodrow Wilson?
Willy Wonka?
Walter White?
You got me.
ï»¿1
That was nasty, man.
Hello, Carol.
She's so cute.
I know, isn't she?
She takes after her mother.
Well, thank goodness for that.
Okay, everybody, since you were so good
and you ate all your dinner, everybody.
Is sweetie hungry? Sweetie, pumpkin pie, this one's for you. That one's for you.
She's got a lot more hair than you do.
Yes. You wear that so well. You do.
Look at what I have. Special one for you.
Oh, my God, Skyler. I'll take the pink one.
It's a pink one.
Oh, Skyler.
I know, right?
Well, actually, they were my idea. You are all welcome.
You are the devil.
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, buddy. Ready for a cold one?
No, no.
Not feeling 100 percent. Oh, I hope it's not something you ate.
No, no. I just--
We have Pepto, Uncle Hank.
Yeah.
Uh, no, I'm good, I, uh-- I think we need to shove off.
Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. Oh. Okay.
Sorry, Skyler, I hate to leave--
No, no. Don't worry about it. I have help.
And by that, she means me. Ha, ha.
That is correct.
Holly can help.
Let's go send them on their way.
Yeah.
Let's say goodbye to auntie and uncle.
Been too long.
Say, "Bye, auntie." Bye, sweetie, bye-bye.
You know, it's been about 100 years since we've been bowling.
Then how about Thursday?
Oh, that sounds great.
Thank you for having us.
Absolutely. Take care of him. Hey. You okay to drive?
Yeah.
All right, well, feel better.
Say, "Bye, Uncle Hank. Bye-bye."
"Bye, Uncle Hank. Bye, Aunt Marie."
All right, let's get started on those dishes. Come on.
You. You.
No, you. You.
Washing, okay? I'll dry. You wash.
You're a good washer. Hello, Carol.
Oh, hi, Walt.
Europe.
I can't believe it. Were you there when she said that?
Yeah.
You okay? Your stomach okay?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Okay.
God, Jesus, Europe.
I just--
And, you know, where they were three or four months ago.
She was talking about it like it was a second honeymoon.
We need to go to Europe. We could go. Yeah.
Have it be like a business trip, you know?
It could, um, be Italy. To Lake Como...
Hank? Hank?
Hank? You okay?
Hank!
Oh, my God. Hank?
Hank? Hank?
Oh, my God. Hank?
No. Are you okay? I'm good.
Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance!
Okay. You okay?
Just take a breath. Yeah.
Oh, God, sweetie.
An accident. It happens.
I'll make the appointment.
All you have to do is show up. For what?
Three hours in the emergency room, all for nothing.
All they did was rule out a heart attack.
What if it happens again? It won't happen again.
How can you know that? You can't say what it was.
Marie, baby. I'm okay. I'm fine, trust me. Discussion over.
And do not tell Skyler. What? Why?
Just don't.
There's nothing to be embarrassed about. Hank?
Luis.
Enrique. Ooh.
Hi.
Hi.
Okay.
Here you go. There's complimentary coffee inside. Have an A-1 day.
Air fresheners are high-margin, right?
At 30 cents wholesale? Yeah.
Right. So I'm thinking we reorganize the display.
Separate the food scents from the nature scents.
I mean, does bubble gum belong anywhere near ocean spray? No.
And pine is still our biggest seller, right?
So maybe we move that over to the cash register, by the 5-hour Energy drink.
Sure. That'd be fine. Yeah, yeah.
Come here.
Speaking of the business,
the story comes first.
The story is is that we are car wash owners, pure and simple.
But if our story is that the car wash is successful,
then what do successful car wash owners do?
They buy more car washes.
Listen.
Skyler, you'll be laundering that money for years.
Decades.
Wouldn't two be better than one?
Well, there's Gentle Hands over by Kirtland. I do love that location.
I'll think about it.
Yeah. Right, right. To be continued.
Okay.
Good morning. Welcome to A-1.
Just the regular, please.
Well, we're having a special on hand wax, 21.99
if you're interested in getting rid of those water spots.
Just the regular is fine.
Okay. Well, there's complimentary coffee inside while you're waiting.
Have an A-1 day.
Please give this to your car wash professional, and have an A-1 day.
Sixty-eight percent. And falling.
Good morning. May I have your ticket, please?
I knew there would be a drop in quality, but 68 percent?
This is not what I agreed to.
I left a viable operation. The rest was up to you.
May I have your ticket, please?
I'm only asking for a few days,
a week at most. Call it a tutorial.
That's the standard wash.
Fix this. Get the ship back on course. We'll make it worth your while.
That'll be 14.95, please.
Listen, this is a complicated situation. There are a lot of moving parts.
None of which are my concern.
You're putting me in a box here.
You know what could happen.
Again, none of my concern.
There's your change, and if you'll hand this to your car wash professional...
And have an A-1 day.
Listen-- It'll only be a few more minutes.
There's some complimentary coffee, if you like.
What's up?
Just wondering who washes a rental car.
Walt, who was that?
She's a former business associate
who wants me to go back.
And I won't.
Enrique, this one's finished.
Get out of here.
Now.
Excuse me?
Never come back here.
Do you understand me?
I-- Go.
Hey. Hey.
Oh, thanks.
You going in today?
Uh, no. No, no.
Good. You know, stay out of there till you're sure you're better.
Yeah. Stay home, rest,
don't even think about work. Okay.
All right? I'll see you later. All right.
Morning, Mrs. Schrader. Hey, guys. What's going on?
Dropping these off. Where'd you like them?
Bring them around to the garage, guys. I got it.
Have a good day.
You too.
Boss, Janice said to tell you a few of them might not have indexes.
We could give you a hand sorting through them.
No, I got it, thanks.
All right.
Well, see you, boss.
Okay.
Okay, uh...
Dude, you are tripping. I'm not dead.
I'm on the starship <i>Enterprise,</i> macking on Yeoman Rand
while the Andorian with the disruptor is back on Talos IV, or whatever.
What do you think all those sparkles and shit are?
Transporters are breaking you apart, man.
Down to your molecules and bones. They're making a copy.
That dude who comes out on the other side? He's not you. He's a color Xerox.
So you're telling me every time Kirk went into the transporter he was killing himself?
So over the whole series, there's, like, 147 Kirks?
At least. Dude, why do you think McCoy never likes to beam nowhere?
Because he's a doctor, bitch. Look it up. It's science.
I ever tell you about my <i>Star Trek</i> script?
<i>Star Trek</i> script? Yeah. I gotta write it down, is all.
The <i>Enterprise</i> is five parsecs out of Rigel XII.
Nothing's going on. Neutral zone is quiet.
The crew is bored, so they put on a pie-eating contest.
The whole crew's in the galley. They're eating tulaberry pies.
Tulaberry? Tulaberries, from Gamma Quadrant, yo.
That's <i>Voyager,</i> dude. Okay, blueberries, then.
They're eating blueberry pies Better.
as fast as the replicator can churn them out:
Finally it's down to just three: Kirk, Spock and Chekov.
Okay, Spock always wins these things.
How is Spock gonna beat Kirk, yo? Spock's like a toothbrush.
Look at Kirk. He's got room to spare.
Spock has total Vulcan control over his digestion. You wanna hear this or not?
Yeah. Yeah, go. Okay. Finally, Kirk,
he can't take it anymore. He yorks.
Now it's just down to Chekov and Spock.
But Chekov, you see, he's got a whole fat stack of quatloos riding on this
and he has figured out a way to win.
He's got Scotty back in the Transporter Room locked in on Chekov's stomach.
Every time Chekov eats a pie, Scotty beams it right out of him.
Where's he sending them? The toilet? Space.
Oh! There's blueberries just floating out there,
frozen, because it's in space.
And Chekov is just shoveling them into his mouth
and Spock's like, "I can't believe this Russian is defeating me."
Meanwhile, Scotty's in the Transporter Room
fiddling with levers when Lieutenant Uhura comes in.
She's got, you know, her big pointies, and Scotty's fingers are all sweaty.
No. Chekov screams.
He sprays blood out of his mouth.
Scotty beamed his guts into space.
No way!
Hey, man, where you going? You're missing the best part.
Just fill this out, bring it back to me.
Yo.
Yo!
You know you can't smoke that up in here.
Yeah, Jesse Pinkman's out here smoking pot.
Give me a break, man.
Pinkman. He'll see you now.
Woody Harrelson, live and in person. Pull up a bong and take a seat.
Hey, I'm kidding about the bong. Don't be doing that.
Uh, sorry to keep you on ice out there, kid. If I'd known it was you...
Well, that Francesca, I've warned her before.
One more time and it's back to the DMV.
So, uh, are we on our own today?
Barn door open.
Barn door?
Oh.
So how is the maestro? Things have been quiet on this end.
I haven't seen him.
Just as well, probably.
That whole thing in the jails. I mean,
when they start to whack lawyers, that's when I draw the line.
This goes to Kaylee Ehrmantraut
and that goes to Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sharp.
315 East Pueblo. It's up in White Horse.
It's 2 and a half million each. Total of 5.
Mr. and Mrs. who?
Drew Sharp's parents.
Drew Sharp? Uh, that's the kid on TV?
The missing--? So but why would you--?
Scratch that. Heh. I don't know, and I don't wanna know. Uh...
The thing is, what those folks want is to know what happened to their boy.
A sack full of cash on their doorstep? That's just gonna raise more questions.
Kaylee Ehrmantraut? That's Mike's granddaughter?
So this is Mike's money? It's mine.
It's your money. Okay. And you're giving it to Kaylee Ehrmantraut?
It's what Mike wanted.
So you and Mike, uh, you've been in touch?
So we're just talking about charity?
Yeah.
Okay, look, you know, um, shelling out money to the ex and her little boy,
I kind of get it. I mean, kind of. But this, ha, ha, this is a bridge too far.
I'm sorry to say, kid, but you're still gonna be two miracles short of sainthood.
Brass tacks. Okay, my job is to advise,
and my advice is, come on, already.
Mike left one step ahead of the boys in blue.
You better believe his family's on the radar.
A couple million bucks shows up, they're gonna snatch it.
The feds have already taken Kaylee's money twice.
What, are you going for a hat trick? I'll freaking do it myself, Saul.
No, no, no! I was just thinking out loud.
Enough bullshit, Saul. Are you gonna do this or not?
Yes, yes. Absolutely. I live to serve.
And, kid, you might wanna think about cleaning up a little, getting some rest.
You've looked better. Just get it done.
You know who this is? Don't hang up on me.
Yeah, there's a problem.
There's 5 million of them here in my office.
No, no, don't. Just hold on to it.
Yes.
Ye--
Yes.
Calm down.
I'll handle it.
DÃ©jÃ  vu, huh?
Jesus.
All right, look,
you wanna talk me through this?
What you were thinking?
What you asked Saul to do. I mean, come on.
It's just nonsensical.
Do you--?
Do you have any explanation at all?
Blood money. What?
It's like you said.
It's blood money.
I sa--?
Jesus. Okay, yes, all right. I said that.
I did.
But it was in the heat of the moment. I was trying to win an argument.
All right? And I was wrong.
This is your money.
Come on, you've earned it.
Drew Sharp.
That is a terrible memory, no doubt about it.
But, son,
you need to stop focusing on the darkness behind you.
The past is the past.
Look, nothing can change what we've done.
But now that's over.
You're out.
And so am I.
That's right. I'm done.
I've been out for about a month.
But there is nothing left for us to do except to try
to live...
ordinary, decent lives.
Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?
She needs someone looking after her.
Mike is perfectly capable of looking after his own granddaughter.
I don't think so.
I don't think he is capable.
I don't think he's coming back.
What--? What are you saying?
You doing what you did,
offing Mike's guys?
If he was out there, you'd have to look over your shoulder for the rest of your life.
And that's not how you do things. So I think he's dead,
and I think you know that.
I don't know that.
I don't.
Listen to me.
I did not kill Mike.
The last time that I saw him, he had his bag, the one that I brought him.
And he got into his car, and he drove away.
And for all I know, he's alive and well.
And if...
If he does come back and he doesn't understand why I had to do what I did...
well, then, that's on me.
Jesse?
I need you to believe this.
It's not true. It's just not.
So he's out there?
He's okay?
Yes.
Mike is fine, wherever he is.
We both know that he can take care of himself.
And he's certainly capable to provide for his own family. Okay?
Jesse.
I need you to believe me.
Yeah.
Like you said.
He's alive.
Yeah.
Mike's alive.
Absolutely.
You've got to have a counselor. Are they bringing in someone new?
I don't know. Um, maybe she'll be back.
What if she's not? What are you supposed to do? What's Louis gonna do?
He's not worried.
Oh, yeah, sure. What's there to worry about? It's only college, right?
Right.
College. Nothing more important.
Oh, you know, Uncle Hank's still not feeling well,
so bowling's off tomorrow night.
Really?
Really.
So you're spared a night out with the family.
You do not have to look so happy about it.
I'll be right back.
Um...
So if bowling's off,
can I get a late curfew?
Are you gonna turn off the light?
Have you seen <i>Leaves of Grass?</i>
Hm?
My book.
Walt Whitman. Dark green hardcover.
I didn't even know we had that.
Hm.
You don't think Junior...?
You're kidding, right?
Well,
it'll show up.
What's wrong with Hank? Mm...
It's a stomach bug, sounds like.
He hasn't been to work all week.
Well, good night.
Night.
Mister. Can you help me out?
Spare some change?
Hey.
Come back.
Yeah. You. Come here, I got something for you.
Here.
Take it.
Go ahead.
Just take it.
Take it.
Yeah.
Anything you want us to tell Steve Gomez?
Says he's worried about you.
Yeah. Tell him I already got two grandmas.
Listen, tell everybody more work and less worry.
Guess we better hit it. Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, guys.
Walt.
How are you? Good to see you.
How you doing?
Well, you know, I can't complain. Heh, heh.
How's your son's arm? I was thinking about that.
Back to 100 percent. Going to district.
Gonna be exciting. This Saturday?
This Saturday morning. I think first pitch is at 10 a.m.
Yeah, yeah. It'll be fun. Should be a big crowd.
Guys, you're still on the clock here! Let's go.
See you, Walt.
See you, Artie.
All right, Scott. Be well.
They're good guys, huh? Yeah, they're good guys.
Well, it's good to see you up and about. Yeah.
How are you feeling? Well, you know. I've been better, but...
Yeah. Have you--?
Did you get to see a doctor? I mean,
when one of these things lasts more than three days,
you really should get that checked. Yeah, no, I did, and I'm fine.
I'm, what they say, on the upswing, you know?
Mm. Good. Good to hear. Yeah.
When I heard you weren't going in to work, I-- Well...
Looks like you have the work coming to you.
Perks of being the boss, huh?
Eh, you know...
How's, uh--?
How's things at the car wash?
Good. Yeah?
Yeah, really good.
Hey, did you have any of that potato salad?
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe. Yeah, I mean, no one else got sick,
so I probably shouldn't worry about it.
Well, Skyler will be very happy to hear that you're feeling better.
Which reminds me, I better get back to it.
If there's anything I can do...
Feel better.
You know...
you're gonna laugh, but I have to ask you about this.
Believe it or not, I found this on my car.
I mean, it looks just like the GPS tracker that we used on Gus Fring, doesn't it?
Back when we were tracking him, just the two of us.
You wouldn't know anything about this, would you, Hank?
You okay?
I gotta say, I don't like the way you're looking at me right now.
It was you.
All along, it was you!
You son of a bitch.
You drove into traffic to keep me from that laundry.
Calm down.
That call I got, telling me Marie was in the hospital,
that wasn't Pinkman.
You had my cell number.
You killed 10 witnesses to save your sorry ass.
Listen to me. You bombed a nursing home.
Heisenberg. Heisenberg.
You lying, two-faced sack of shit.
Hank.
Look, I don't know where this is coming from, Hank, but just--
I swear to Christ,
I will put you under the jail. Take a breath, okay? Listen to yourself.
These wild accusations, they could destroy our family. And for what?
You don't give a shit about family!
Hank, my cancer is back.
Good.
Rot, you son of a bitch.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I wanna beat this thing, I do.
I'm back on chemo, and I am fighting like hell.
But the truth is, in six months, you won't have someone to prosecute.
But even--
Even if somehow you were able to convince anyone
that I was capable of doing these things,
you and I both know I would never see the inside of a jail cell.
I'm a dying man
who runs a car wash.
My right hand to God, that is all that I am.
What's the point?
Have Skyler bring the kids here.
And then we'll talk.
That is not going to happen.
I don't know who you are.
I don't even know who I'm talking to.
If that's true...
if you don't know who I am...
then maybe your best course...
would be to tread lightly.
ï»¿1
Mariano, it's me. I need you to get Skyler on the line.
No, no, I need you to get her on the phone right now.
Tell her it's urgent.
No-- What do you mean she won't get off the phone?
I am giving you permission, Mariano. You make her get off the phone.
Mariano, who is Skyler on the phone with?
Yeah.
Okay.
Where is she? Where's Skyler? She just kind of left.
She didn't say where she was going.
Skyler, my-- My head is spinning.
And yours, I...
I can't even imagine.
So much makes sense to me now.
You jumping in the pool, you sending us your kids, I get it.
I just wished I'd seen it sooner.
He's a monster.
He's a...
Look, I don't know what he did to you to force you to keep his secrets.
If he threatened you, or whatever mind games he played...
I don't know if there was abuse.
But I want you to know that you can be open with me.
Don't hold anything back, okay?
I mean, I don't even understand if you know the full extent of this,
what he's done.
Not just the meth cooking, but the lives he's destroyed.
But, look, that's all behind you, starting now.
You're done being his victim.
Because here's what we're gonna do.
Sky, here's what we're gonna do.
You and the kids will move back to our house,
where you'll be safe, where he can't get to you.
Hank, does Marie...?
No. We'll get to that soon enough.
It's just you and me right now, okay?
Okay.
Before we, um...
Before we get you back to the house, I...
I'm gonna ask you to tell me everything you can.
Um, take as long as you like.
Just start from the beginning when you first became aware of Walt's activities
and just try to be as detailed as you can.
What, right-- Right here?
Right now? Sure. Why not?
While it's still fresh, you know?
And just remember to state your name and the date before you start.
Hank, do...?
Do we have to do this right now?
No, we don't have to do this right now, no.
Here's the thing, I need something solid that I can bring to my people.
A statement, on the record.
So you testifying to Walt's criminal activity,
whatever you know, goes a long, long way here.
Okay? I mean, you see, building a case this big,
gathering evidence, enough to get a conviction,
we're talking a long-haul proposition.
I don't want that bastard running out the clock. But with your testimony--
What do you mean, running out the clock?
His cancer. His cancer is back.
So he says.
He didn't tell you?
Who's to say it's even true? Lying piece of shit.
Look, regardless, I mean, we'll just assume.
Fine. Okay?
That son of a bitch looks me in the eye and he says if what I know is true-- "If."
-he'll be dead before I can prove it.
The balls on that son of a...
I got all these little pieces. They're all part of the story.
They don't mean much on their own, but when you tell me what you know,
we start filling in the gaps, I'll have him in lockup before the sun goes down.
Hank, I...
I think maybe...
Maybe I need a lawyer.
What?
No, no, no, you don't.
Yeah, I think maybe I do.
Skyler, understand, I am here to help you.
But to do that, I need your help.
We start bringing in lawyers and they start putting up roadblocks
where they don't need to be
and my ability to control this situation diminishes.
Just for my own protection, and just...
You know, it seems to make sense that I should have someone to talk to.
Skyler, I'm your biggest advocate here, and I'm telling you, for your own good,
you need to get out ahead of this thing.
I mean, you start, you know, getting defensive--
I'm not saying it's right, but I'll tell you it's a fact,
the DA will look at you differently.
But you don't know that. Skyler, yes, I do.
I've been around long enough to know. It's in your best interest
to get out there and show the world you have nothing to hide.
Look,
no one in the world is more important to me
than your sister.
So believe me when I tell you
that your best interests and mine are the same.
But, Hank, you telling me not to talk to a lawyer
doesn't sound like that at all.
It sounds like what you want...
What you want is to get Walt
at all costs.
Okay.
Okay, let's just...
slow down. Slow down.
You can...
You can talk to a lawyer later.
But right now, what we need to do,
we need to go get the kids.
We need to bring them to my house so that they're safe,
and then we need to help each other put that animal away, okay?
Come on. Hank.
Let's go to the house and we'll deal with it there.
Am I under arrest?
What? Am I under arrest?
Skyler, I-- You're not thinking straight about this.
You have to listen to me. I-- Skyler. Skyler. Skyler.
Am I under arrest? No.
Am I under arrest? No. Sky--
Hank, are you arresting me? Sky--
Am I under arrest?!
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
I gotta do it, man.
Dude. Mm.
What are you doing? Huell.
Hey, quit screwing around. Mm.
We are here to do a job, not channel Scrooge McDuck.
You hearing me?
I hear you.
Dude.
Aw, screw it.
Mexico.
All's I'm saying.
Guy hit 10 guys in jail within a two-minute window.
All's I'm saying.
Yeah, it's me again. Listen, you've got to hide those bags.
The monkey is in the banana patch, capiche?
So call me.
That's the third message. Where the hell is that kid?
That's her. Don't.
I have to talk to her. You don't.
Answer that phone and Schrader's on the line with a wiretap
recording everything. You're not doing anybody any favors.
Why do you still have a battery in that thing? Take it out.
They might be trying to triangulate your movements.
I'm not being paranoid. Do it.
I can't believe she went to him. She just panicked.
She went right to him without even talking to me.
I'm not saying it's not bad. It's bad, but it could be worse.
Really? How much worse could it be, exactly, in your estimation?
What does she actually know? What has she seen? Hm?
Nothing. It's hearsay. It's all he said, she said.
The only real evidence that she can lead them to is your money.
Once we take care of that, well, yeah, then they got nothing.
Nothing? Hank knows. That's not nothing.
Yeah. I can't exactly see him turning the other cheek.
Of course there's always, um...
Always what?
Have you given any thought to, um, sending him on a trip to Belize?
Belize? Yeah, Belize.
You know, where, uh...
Where Mike went to, off on a trip to, uh, Belize.
Saul, you better not be saying what I think you're saying.
It's just conjecture on my part. Hank is family.
Okay, it's an option that-- You understand that?
It's an option that has worked well for you in the past.
Jesus. What is wrong with you? My mistake. Family, off limits, of course.
I'm just throwing thoughts out there. This is a safe room, right?
Jesus. Send him to Belize. I'll send you to Belize.
Finally.
It's about time. Have you two been followed?
Are you sure?
If they had, we'd all be in handcuffs right now.
I took the tops off.
Figured you'd wanna check to make sure it's all there.
You figured right.
Close enough.
If you need any help on the other end... These things are a bitch to move.
I'll manage. And we don't mind overtime.
Ain't no thing.
Pay Huell and Kuby and take your cut.
The rest is mine. Insurance in case I need you.
In case you need me? I'm thinking the probability is high.
Just find Jesse.
Keys.
Saul Goodman, please. Skyler White.
No, no, please don't tell me he isn't there.
I know he's been avoiding my calls.
All right, well, has my husband been there?
What do you mean you don't know? Either he has or he hasn't. I don't--
Sweetie.
Sky?
Sky, I know you're home.
Let me in. Let me talk to you.
I'm just gonna wait here until you open the door.
So let me in now or three hours from now,
but I'm not leaving until I see you.
Skyler, please.
Just you.
Not Hank.
Tell me Hank is crazy.
Tell me he doesn't know what he's talking about.
You gotta give me something, Skyler.
Anything to help me understand.
It can't be true.
Oh, my God.
How long have you known?
Hank said that when you walked into the pool, that's when you knew.
When you had your...
But not then. Before that.
Since Gus Fring?
The money.
All that money that Walt made
when you bought your car wash.
And your whole gambling story.
That was a lie. I...
Did you know then?
You had to.
Skyler...
did you know since before Hank was shot?
Skyler?
Marie.
I am so sorry.
You're sorry.
You're...
I'm sick of--
You won't talk.
You won't talk to Hank
because you think that Walt is going to get away with this.
Oh, God.
Come on, baby. Come on.
Let's go. Marie. Marie. Hey.
What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing?
She's coming with us. No, she is not.
Give her back to me. Marie.
Hank. Hank, help! Hank!
You are not leaving this house with my daughter.
Give her back to me.
Marie, give her back to me. Stop it.
You're scaring her.
Give her back. I'm trying to protect her.
I'm her mother. She's not gonna live in this madhouse!
You don't know what you're talking about. Give her back.
Marie. Listen, I will call the police.
You call them. You call them, Skyler. I will. Give me my baby.
Marie, put her down. You can't take her away.
Marie. Give me my baby.
We are not leaving without her.
Give me my baby now! Marie!
Do it now.
Give her back.
That's right. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay. I got you.
Okay, Mama has you now.
Mama has you now. Mama has you. Shh.
It's okay. It's okay.
Shh.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
You have to get him.
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.
Walt.
Where have you been?
Oh, my God.
What happened?
You moved the money, didn't you? You buried it somewhere.
Did you get my messages?
I told Hank nothing.
Walt, I swear I didn't.
Say something.
Please.
Oh, my God.
Walt. Walt.
Hey.
How--? How long was I out?
Four or five hours. Oh.
How are you feeling?
It's true.
The cancer is back.
Is this it?
Does that make you happy?
I can't remember the last time I was happy.
Just tell me.
I know you talked with Hank.
I know you made a deal.
Skyler, I'll make this easy.
I'll give myself up if you promise me one thing.
You keep the money.
Never speak of it.
Never give it up.
You pass it on to our children.
Give them everything.
Would you do that?
Please.
Please don't let me have done all this for nothing.
How did Hank find out?
Did somebody talk?
No, no one talked.
It was me.
I screwed up.
The way Hank talks,
he's got his suspicions.
Not much else.
You can't give yourself up without giving up the money.
It's the way this works, Walt.
So maybe our best move here...
is to stay quiet.
Okay, you can take it off now.
All right, what's so important you had to come way out here?
The amount of money I'm bringing in,
I deserve to see why it's all going wrong.
You an expert on meth labs now?
You gonna tell us how to fix our operation?
And what if I can help? What will it hurt to show me?
I don't like my time being wasted.
Well, I'm here, and 10 minutes is a small sacrifice
when we're talking about a $50 million shortfall.
So?
Safe to come down?
Yeah. You're good.
Ladies first.
Okay, now you've seen it. Yeah, now I've seen it.
What?
Well, how about we start with it's filthy.
What are you, my mother? What filthy? It's just dimly lit.
Do you seriously think this is up to the standards of your predecessor?
Because it's not. Not even close.
Well, the product we're making, it's selling just fine.
Heisenberg's standards don't matter anymore.
To whom? A bunch of scabby Arizona tweakers?
They matter to my buyer in the Czech Republic, therefore, they matter to me.
Look, I cannot move what this person is making if it's substandard.
And it is. It just is. No offense.
If you can do better, do better. I don't know what to tell you.
You tried to get the man back, right?
He said no, so... I mean, what do you want me to do?
Todd. Use Todd again.
Look, he learned from him, all right?
At least Todd's first two cooks were at 74 percent.
On his third cook, he started a fire.
Look, I tried Heisenberg's way. It didn't work out.
I wanna cook in my territory. I wanna use guys that I trust,
not Todd, who I don't.
And that's the end of the conversation as far as I'm concerned.
I really wish you'd have given him a chance.
Hey. We have a problem.
You stay here.
Get down!
Hello? Ma'am, you okay?
Hello?
Safe to come up whenever you want.
I...
I don't want to see.
Okay.
Cool, so I guess maybe, um...
Maybe just close your eyes.
Okay.
This way.
To the right.
Ha-ha. Are you kidding me with this?
Heh. Uncle Jack.
Fire in the hole.
It's okay. Sorry about that.
It's cool, lady.
Okay, boys, let's take it all. Let's get everything.
Hey.
You...
going into work today?
You're kidding, right?
What about you?
Are you going to the office?
You have to tell them, Hank.
Today.
Marie, I just-- I just don't have it yet.
The piece I need to prove it all, it's just not here.
Then let them help you.
Tell Steve, tell Ramey.
You've got enough to get them to believe your story at least.
Put the whole DEA on it.
That's how this is supposed to work, right?
No.
No?
What no? What are you, Lone Wolf McQuade?
Look, baby-- You've gotta go in with this, Hank.
Look, the day I go in with this...
that's the last day of my career, all right?
I'm going to have to walk in there, look those people in the eye
and admit that the person I've been chasing the past year
is my own brother-in-law.
It's over for me.
Ten seconds after I tell this story, I'm a civilian.
And then how can we help Skyler if she comes to her senses?
When I go in there...
I'm bringing proof, not suspicions.
I can be the man who caught him, at least.
What if you wait
and they catch Walt without you?
If they find out that you knew and you said nothing?
Hank, wouldn't you go to jail too?
Hey, Hank. Welcome back.
Morning.
Hey. Hey, boss.
How you doing, Hank? Hey.
Hey. Look who's back.
I had to see it with my own eyes.
How you doing? Good. Yeah, yeah. You miss me?
Miss you? Like my balls miss jock itch, maybe.
Yeah? I didn't know you had balls.
All right, don't make me sorry I stopped by here.
Anyway, you got a budget meeting in an hour,
then a meet-and-greet with the new prescription task force guys.
All right. Hey, you know, listen.
Let's see if we can get that budget meeting pushed
and instead see if you could set up a conference call with Ramey.
What for?
Just a "getting back up to speed" thing, you know, for me.
All right. You got it.
Oh, hey. Did you hear about that money thing?
No, what money thing?
Oh, you're gonna love this. It involves your old pal Jesse Pinkman.
Pinkman?
I'll give you this. Jesse, you're never boring.
Not boring at all.
So come on, buddy, share with us.
Why were you tossing millions of dollars all over Albuquerque?
I promise you we can hold out just as long as you can.
That's a fact. I got a bladder the size of a hot water bottle.
Man, all that cash. I wouldn't be able to stop talking about it.
I know. But I don't think I'd be tossing it out my car window.
Heh-heh. Yeah.
My take-home doesn't allow for that whole Robin Hood thing.
But apparently Jesse is raking it in. Yes, indeed.
I'm sure he's got a perfectly reasonable explanation for where he got it.
Sure. He found it.
Or won it in a card game, maybe. That's it. Won it in a card game.
Lucky night at the casino.
Jesse, did you have a lucky night?
Okay. Jesse, we're gonna let you gather your thoughts
so we can continue this stimulating conversation.
Can we get you anything? Coffee? A soda?
Right. Yeah. Thought not.
I have a history with Jesse Pinkman,
and I think he can be helpful to me on another active investigation.
Look, I'm only asking for a couple minutes here.
You said he wasn't talking? Let me tell you, that kid hates my guts.
Despises me, okay?
Maybe I can get him cranked up enough that he starts yapping.
Then you guys go in, get what you need from the little shit-stain, finish him off.
Gives me anything useful while he's with me, I'll share it, 100 percent.
I could use a smoke break. Yeah. How about you?
Yeah. Maybe you could keep an eye on our suspect for us, just for a few minutes.
Absolutely. I can do that.
Okay.
All right, guys.
ï»¿1
Hey, Mr. White. It's me. Um,
I know you're probably real busy with retirement
but I got some news I think you should maybe know about.
Me and Declan had some differences of opinion
and it got a little...
messy. Um...
It's all straightened out now
but just a heads-up, there's been a kind of change in management.
Anyway, just thought you should know.
Feel free to give me a call if you want the details
but, you know, it's cool, so whatever.
Okay, then. Thanks. Bye.
<i>Right, so there I am, I'm on top of the train,</i>
pumping the water in, he's watching to make sure we put in
exactly what he'd calculated.
We gotta be real precise because water and methylene weigh different
and he figured it all out
to, like, milliliter. I'm up there with my hose,
we're going as fast as we can. We only got a few minutes.
At the crossing, we got this guy who's smooth-talking the engineer.
And it's all just going great
until this other dude shows up in this monster truck
so we're pretty much screwed, because he can just push
the entire dump truck off the tracks, which, you know, is what he does.
Wait. What's your guy doing?
You can't stop him? Yeah, but what's he gonna say?
"Thanks anyway, sir, but my friends are still stealing cargo back there."
So I'm looking all around, because I know we're not done,
but the gallons are slowly ticking away.
And finally Mr. White tells me to cut it.
So I fling the hose, I'm grabbing the cap, I'm screwing in the bolts.
Just, like, busting ass, you know?
And then I feel the train start moving and I'm--
You're... I'm on top.
Did you piss your pants? Yeah, right?
So the thing starts speeding up, so I jump off the moving train.
Like, total stuntman stuff.
It's like <i>Hooper.</i> You ever see <i>Hooper?</i>
Oh, hey, man, Burt Reynolds. Good movie.
He jumped out of a helicopter, not a train.
Whatever, man. It's a good movie.
This guy Jesse, he's underneath, and the train just drives right over him.
And luckily he's this skinny little guy.
Damn. That's a tight operation.
It was perfect.
No one even knew they got robbed, just like we planned.
Mr. White told me it was, like, the biggest train heist ever,
like, potential money-wise.
So that's how that happened. Ha, ha.
Can I get you anything else?
Nope. Thanks, darling.
I'm ready for the check.
You feeling good about cooking?
Yeah.
You'll be able to run your own lab?
Do it up right? Yeah. For sure. I got this.
All right.
Let's make some money, then. I gotta hit the head.
Ever been on a plane and find yourself
looking down at the armrest next to you,
looking at the little plug where the ashtray used to go?
I look at that and I say, "What the hell happened to this country?"
Nanny state.
I see a kid with a bicycle helmet on,
I wanna smack the shit out of him, like, for his own good.
Mr. Pinkman.
How are you today?
Not so good, huh?
Of course, I might be able to help you out.
I wanna talk to you about your partner, Heisenberg.
See, I know he's my brother-in-law, Walt.
Oh, yeah. That's the look.
Lucky for you, I'm more interested in him.
So I got an offer.
If you help me out here,
tell me all about you and him and your little meth business,
maybe I talk to my friends at the A.P.D.
and make all this go away.
I know he's the mastermind here.
Plus...
I'm thinking, based on your recent activities,
that maybe there's a little trouble in paradise?
Maybe you guys aren't getting along so good?
I'm right, aren't I?
Eat me.
Sure that's how you want to play this?
Why don't you try and beat it out of me?
That's your thing, right?
He really did a number on you, didn't he?
I don't know,
but happy people usually don't go around
throwing millions of dollars away.
I don't think
Walt's gonna be patting you on the back for that.
But maybe that's the point.
But, you see, I get that.
My own brother-in-law,
lying to me for over a year.
Using me.
Maybe you understand that feeling.
Help me out here, Jesse...
and we can put him away.
I know you want that.
I think you wanna talk.
Not to you.
Agent Schrader, beat any good suspects lately?
Tall and taller, ask him about his history with my client.
He knocked the poor kid unconscious last time they were alone.
So, what'll it be, a civil rights lawsuit the size of Montana?
Because I'll oblige you.
Oh. So long, Rocky. Keep your left up.
Detectives, I'm inviting you to leave.
I'm gonna try to remain calm,
but will you do me a favor and tell me what is up with you?
My guys are busting their asses
trying to hide Walt's money from the feds
and you're tossing yours out a window?
And I have to hear about your little act of philanthropy on the news?
Did you hit your head or something?
Why didn't you call me the second you got arrested?
What did you say to Schrader?
Nothing. Jesus. Just chill out.
Chill out? No. No, I don't chill out right now
because things have gone nuclear.
I imagine Schrader shared with you his recent discovery.
Okay, well, then you get my complete lack of chill.
Just use the money that I gave you.
No, Saul. Saul, I--
Stop-- Saul.
Stop talking. I don't care.
Just-- Just make it happen. Work your magic.
And call me when he's out.
Hey, Dad, I'm home.
Oh, okay. I'll be right out.
Hey, you going to work today? You were out late last night.
Huh? I-- Well, I, uh...
Yeah, I guess I just lost track of time.
Dad. Huh?
I'm gonna head out, okay?
Where you going? Uh, Aunt Marie just called.
She wants me to help her with some computer thing
and asked me to stay for dinner.
That cool?
Uh... I guess that--
Cool. All right, see you later.
Wait, uh, son?
Junior. Hang on a second. Yeah?
Oh, good. Come on back inside. What happened?
Oh, this? Nothing. No, I'm fine. It's fine.
Really. I do wanna talk to you, though.
Okay. Are you okay?
Yeah. Here. Sit down a second.
I just don't wanna keep things from you, okay?
I mean, you deserve to know what's happening.
Yesterday, I passed out.
Briefly. Very, very briefly.
And I did this.
Why did you pass out?
Well, my latest scans
show a little shadow on my lung.
But my doctor put me right on a new round of chemo,
which is why I've been so tired lately.
But I was pushing myself too hard.
I know it. I just don't want you to worry.
I learned my lesson.
Well, um, what's the...?
What now?
What now is that we go on, like always. Right?
Hey, don't worry about this, okay?
I know that's hard, but I beat this once.
There's no reason to think I won't again.
And my doctor says I'm doing great.
I'm responding really well to the treatment.
And I'm...
I'm feeling very-- Very good about this, all right?
And what would really help me out
is if we all stayed positive.
Can we do that?
Yeah?
Hm?
Okay.
So why don't you go and help your Aunt Marie
and we'll talk about this later? No. No. No way.
I'm staying. I'm not leaving.
Flynn is not with you, is he? No.
No. Why would he be?
How'd it go?
That bad, huh?
How bad are we talking, Hank?
I didn't tell them.
Why not?
It's just not time yet. No, it's past time.
Way past time. We talked about this.
You've got to tell them now. It's gonna be worse
if they find out that you've kept this from them.
Look, it's just I've got some things I gotta chase down.
What? What things?
Leads, you know.
What leads? What? Something new?
I'm not keeping anything from anybody, Marie, okay? Jesus.
Don't tell me how to do my job.
Walt.
Are you sure about this?
It's the only way.
Okay.
I'm ready.
My name is Walter Hartwell White.
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.
This is my confession.
They're here.
Thank you for coming.
Okay, I'll start.
Skyler and I-- Welcome to GarduÃ±o's.
My name is Trent. I'll be taking care of you.
Can I start anybody off with some beverages? Margarita?
How about some of our tableside guacamole?
I think we're fine. We need some time with the menu.
No worries. Be right back with some water.
So you here to confess?
There's nothing to confess.
We're here to talk about Walter, Jr.
Flynn and Holly should be living with us. End of story.
And while we respect your opinion,
we think that your concern is misplaced.
Skyler and I feel, due to Marie's attempt
to lure him to your house--
I wasn't trying to lure him.
Regardless of what you might call it,
Skyler and I would like to ask you
to please leave our children out of this.
Junior has been through a lot already this year.
You are just...
This investigation, Hank,
do you realize what this will do to him?
Hearing these things?
He's gonna hear it when I kick in your front door and arrest you.
If that day ever comes, so be it.
You have no evidence to support your claims.
Why tear this family apart?
So how about that guacamole?
We make it right here at the table.
I'll just give you guys a few more minutes.
How can you sit there and listen to this?
All we want is for those kids to be safe.
You're putting them in danger, keeping them under the same roof--
They are safe, Marie.
You yourself sent them out of the house. And I brought them back.
Look, whatever you think he did,
this is not an ongoing situation.
Skyler. No.
They need to understand. It's in the past.
It's over. There is nothing to go after here.
There's nothing to accomplish.
How can we believe anything you say?
There's no telling where the lies begin and end.
That affair of yours, did that even happen?
Please. Look, Junior just found out that my cancer is back.
He's already facing the idea of living without his father.
To put this on top of that?
It's just not right.
I swear to God, you start throwing the word "right" at me--
What I mean-- Was it right to run a drug empire?
There is no drug empire.
Lying to your son, to all of us, is that right?
What do I have to do to make you believe me?
Why don't you kill yourself, Walt?
What?
Just kill yourself.
This whole thing dies with you. That's what you're saying here?
Is that Hank should just let it go and wait for you to die.
Well, maybe you should just go ahead and die, then.
That is not a solution. No, it's not a solution.
He's not getting off that easy. Jesus, Hank.
And the same goes for you if you stick with him.
Both of you think you're just gonna walk away from this thing?
Never gonna happen.
That is not what we're saying. Enough with the bullshit.
You're not gonna negotiate your way out of this thing.
There's only one solution: Step up, be a man and admit what you've done.
That's it. There is no other option.
Let's go.
<i>My name is Walter Hartwell White.</i>
<i>I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,</i>
<i>Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.</i>
<i>This is my confession.</i>
<i>If you're watching this tape,</i>
<i>I'm probably dead,</i>
<i>murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader.</i>
<i>Hank has been building a meth empire</i>
<i>for over a year now and using me as his chemist.</i>
<i>Shortly after my 50th birthday,</i>
<i>he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge</i>
<i>to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell</i>
<i>using connections that he made through his career with the DEA.</i>
<i>I was astounded. I...</i>
<i>I always thought Hank was a very moral man</i>
<i>and I was particularly vulnerable at the time,</i>
<i>something he knew</i>
<i>and took advantage of.</i>
<i>I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis</i>
<i>that was poised to bankrupt my family.</i>
<i>Hank took me on a ride-along and showed me just how much money</i>
<i>even a small meth operation could make.</i>
<i>And I was weak.</i>
<i>I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin,</i>
<i>so I agreed.</i>
<i>Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring.</i>
<i>Hank sold me into servitude to this man,</i>
<i>and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family.</i>
<i>I didn't know where to turn.</i>
<i>Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out</i>
<i>and things escalated.</i>
<i>Fring was able to arrange...</i>
<i>Uh, I guess-- I guess you call it a hit on Hank.</i>
<i>It failed, but Hank was seriously injured</i>
<i>and I wound up paying his medical bills,</i>
<i>which amounted to a little over $177,000.</i>
<i>Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge.</i>
<i>Working with a man named Hector Salamanca,</i>
<i>he plotted to kill Fring.</i>
<i>The bomb that he used was built by me.</i>
<i>He gave me no option in that.</i>
<i>I have often contemplated suicide,</i>
<i>but I'm a coward.</i>
<i>I wanted to go to the police...</i>
<i>but I was frightened.</i>
<i>Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA.</i>
<i>To keep me in line, he took my children.</i>
<i>For three months he kept them.</i>
<i>My wife had no idea of my criminal activities,</i>
<i>was horrified to learn what I had done.</i>
<i>I was in hell.</i>
<i>I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family.</i>
<i>Recently, I tried once again to quit,</i>
<i>and in response, he gave me this.</i>
<i>I can't take this anymore.</i>
<i>I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me</i>
<i>or worse, hurt my family.</i>
<i>All I could think to do was to make this video</i>
<i>and hope that the world will finally see this man</i>
<i>for what he really is.</i>
Who do you think he's shown this to?
No one. It's a threat.
It's what he will do if I don't back off.
I think you should show this to Ramey.
Just get ahead of it.
That video is a bunch of lies, Hank. Anybody who knows you will know.
A hundred and seventy-seven thousand dollars?
Hell is he talking about?
Marie?
They told me it was gambling money.
What was gambling money?
Oh, Jesus Christ, Marie.
Oh, God, no. How was I supposed to know?
How was I to know where it came from?
Why were they paying for my bills? What about my insurance?
Insurance wouldn't have covered the treatment you needed, and I...
I wanted the best for you. Why didn't you tell me?
Because I knew that you would refuse it
and without it, you may never have been able to walk again.
Oh, Christ, Marie.
You killed me here.
I mean, it's the-- It's the last nail.
That's the last nail in the coffin.
What do we do?
If I were you, I'd be more nervous.
Ugh. Jesus.
It's always the desert.
Uh, I already checked it.
It's clean. I wouldn't have driven it here if it wasn't.
Get one of these, by the way.
Reads radio signals. Much easier.
What does he know?
I mean, he knows you're Heisenberg.
But I figure not much else,
otherwise, you know, you'd be locked up.
What did he say exactly?
He wants me to inform on you for him.
Tell him everything we did.
Anything else?
I don't think he's told the rest of the DEA.
Why do you say that?
Just him being there all by himself
and, plus, he was acting kind of shady.
Seemed like he didn't want the other cops
hearing what he had to say. Mm.
Are we gonna talk about the rain of caca the kid brought down upon us?
Want to hazard a guess what his little charity drive cost you?
Why don't you go take a walk, Saul?
Jesse, will you let me help you?
I don't like to see you hurting like this.
Maybe it's time for a change.
What kind of change?
I don't know.
I don't know, maybe...
Maybe it's time for you to just
leave all of this behind.
Just get out of town.
Don't look back.
Saul knows a man.
He specializes in giving people new identities.
He would move you someplace far away
and set you up with a whole new life.
Yeah, I know, sounds a little extreme.
But maybe it's exactly what you need.
You know, I really think that would be good for you.
A clean slate.
All right, just think about it.
You get a job, something legitimate, something you like.
Meet a girl, start a family, even.
Hell, you're still so damn young. Heh.
And what's here for you now anyway?
I tell you, if I could, I'd trade places.
A whole lifetime ahead of you
with a chance to hit the reset button.
In a few years,
this might all feel like nothing more than a bad dream.
Would you just, for once,
stop working me?
What are you talking about?
Can you just stop working me for, like, 10 seconds straight?
Huh? Stop jerking me around?
Jesse, I am not working you.
Yes. Yes, you are.
All right, just drop the whole concerned-dad thing
and tell me the truth.
I mean, you're acting like
me leaving town is all about me
and turning over a new leaf, but it's really-- It's really about you.
I mean, you need me gone
because your dickhead brother-in-law is never gonna let up.
Just say so.
Just ask me for a favor.
Just tell me you don't give a shit about me
and it's either this...
It's either this or you'll kill me the same way you killed Mike.
I mean, isn't that what this is all about?
Us meeting way the hell out here.
In case I say no.
Come on.
Just tell me you need this.
Your change.
If you'll hand this to your car wash professional
and have an A-1 day.
Skyler?
Skyler, I've got my chemo in about 45 minutes.
Can you take over the register for me?
Skyler?
It worked
and we're fine.
Okay?
We're fine.
So Palmer and Castanares
are sitting on that jerkoff Saul Goodman's office,
keeping an eye on Jesse Pinkman. Yeah, I put them on it.
You wanna explain that to me?
Yeah. Right.
Why the hell should I know anything? They're just my guys, after all.
You gotta tell me what's going on. Pinkman is A.P.D.'s problem, not ours.
You got a history with this kid.
If he catches wind that you're trailing him
and this explodes, he could sue.
Look, if I can't explain this to Ramey, I gotta pull my guys.
Fine. Take them off.
I said, take them off. What else you want?
I'm going out for a while.
You have that 3:00.
Will you be back?
You know what, it's gonna have to be another day. Reschedule it.
Last chance. You sure there's nobody you wanna say bye to?
Nobody at all?
No.
This is it. Once I make the call, there's no take-backs.
Uh, I need a new dust filter
for my Hoover Max Extract Pressure Pro, model 60.
Can you help me with that?
Yeah, pickup.
He's hot. Um, not "hot" hot, just a little hot.
Currently out on bail. Yeah, he knows the rules.
One hour. Okay, he'll be there.
And done.
Okay,
this guy's fee is 125.
Your benefactor
asked me to send you out with something extra.
Get you started, you know?
Keep you sitting pretty
until you get into the groove of your new life.
Provided, of course, you don't toss it out the window on the way.
Seriously, this is the last of it
so you might wanna think about making a budget.
Hey, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You can't fire up a doob in here. Put that out.
I mean it. Put it out.
Look, Mr. Natural, I'm not gonna let you sabotage this thing.
This guy is not gonna take you if you show up high,
so stop screwing around, or it's both our asses.
Right. Well, that's a start. Now, give with the dope.
Christ.
Some people are immune to good advice.
I'm gonna get a bag for this cash.
Don't even think about lighting up again.
Francesca, we got any bags?
For money. Money-sized bags.
Huell will drop you at the pickup spot,
then he's gonna get the hell out of there.
You got that?
Guy won't pick up the kid if he's got company.
You got a phone?
Cops took it.
All right, in case something goes wrong,
guy doesn't show, whatever, you give me a call.
Seriously? Hello Kitty?
Seriously, it's free.
We got a beggars-choosers situation here, so stop busting my balls.
Corner of Juan Tabo and Osuna.
You, you're gonna sit and wait. This guy's punctual with a capital P.
Okay? So don't move. Don't get up and get an ice cream.
Just stay put like a good boy. He'll pick you up, you pay him.
He'll take your ID, he'll give you a new one.
Goodbye, Jesse Pinkman. Hello, Mr. Credit to Society.
So do I get to pick where I go?
Well, it's your life. I imagine you get a say.
Want a suggestion? How about Florida?
You get a tan, meet the Swedish bikini team,
you know, swim with the dolphins.
What about Alaska?
Alaska. Okay, well, that's a different vibe.
I never figured you for a moose lover,
but whatever floats your boat. Alaska.
Alaska's good.
Anywhere you can get a fresh start is gonna be good.
You ready?
Yeah.
Take care, Jesse.
All right.
Excuse me.
Hey, man, you can't go in there!
He a no-show? Why didn't you call?
Why didn't you--?
Stop! Unh!
Code red!
Huell! No! Hey!
Hey! Get in here!
Back off!
You, stay where you are.
What? I don't know what happened here. What did I do?
You stole it off me.
You and him, you took it out of my pocket, didn't you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down. Yes. Okay. I had Huell lift your dope.
I told you I couldn't risk the guy not taking you.
No! Before. The cigarette.
You stole the cigarette.
What? The ricin cigarette!
You had him steal it off of me!
And all for that asshole Mr. White!
He poisoned Brock!
He poisoned Brock, and you-- You helped him!
Okay, Jesse, calm down. Say it again!
Tell me one more time to calm down! Come on!
I'm sorry. Yes. Okay.
I had Huell lift your cigarette, but Walt made me.
He told me he was helping you, he was saving you.
I never would've agreed to it if I'd known what he was gonna do.
Jesse, you gotta believe me. I didn't want any of this!
Back up!
Get off me! What do I pay you for?
Hey, it's me. We got a big problem.
-eighteen, 19 and 20.
Actually, you gave me a 5, not a 1.
Oh, I-- I did. I'm-- I'm so sorry.
Um, here you go.
Thank you for your honesty.
Oh, and please give this to your car wash professional.
Have an A-1 day.
God.
Hey. Hi.
What's going on? Not much.
Yeah? Nothing? Nope. Things are fine.
Good. Why?
Oh, no reason.
You know what I found the other day
is that the-- The-- The latch on the soda machine wasn't...
latching.
It's-- It's catching every time that I stock that darn thing.
So I thought I'd check it out.
Great.
Thank you.
Oh. Exact change. I like that. Thank you very much.
Okay.
And...
please give this to your car-care professional
and have an A-1 day. Thank you. Thank you.
I just remembered they gave me a prescription
to go pick up, so... I forgot. I'm gonna go
head on over to the drugstore, okay?
Yeah, okay. All right.
ï»¿1
Jesse?
Jesse!
Show yourself right now!
I'll be in touch.
Okay. Hey, Huell.
Listen, I want you to swing by the high school on your way to Saul's.
I can't believe he would go after my son, but...
You got it. And Kuby's at the car wash, right?
Parked right across the street. All's quiet. No Pinkman.
Okay. Just find him.
<i>Please leave a message.</i>
Jesse, listen.
I mean, obviously, you've changed your mind here,
and so thank you for that.
And I know you're angry.
I wanna fix this, okay?
Whatever it takes, all right?
We'll talk, and we will fix this.
Until then, just...
Just sleep it off, okay?
And then call me.
Be safe.
How's it coming?
I replaced the doorjamb and the striker plate.
Switch this out, we'll be good to go. Good.
Do you want separate keys for the different locks
or do you want one working both? No, no, no. No re-key.
Same exact keys as before.
Usually with a break-in, people like to get new keys.
No, same keys, same locks.
The old keys have to work here, okay?
Okay. All right.
Good.
Good. Good, good, good.
Oh, no, no. Hey, guys, guys, guys.
Cut that. Yeah, this... That area's still pretty bad.
Right. We'll have to go over this a lot more.
We've made three passes already.
Like I say, gasoline's tricky.
No, no, no. The smell has got to be gone completely.
My wife is coming home, and I can't have any odor, any stain,
any sign that anything happened here.
Understand?
I-- I know. This is short notice, and I really appreciate it.
Sir, we'd love to take more of your money,
but you've got gas soaked through to your subfloor.
Until you pull this up and get new carpet, new padding,
this is as good as it gets.
Is that gasoline?
Ask Dad. Hey. Over here.
What happened? What happened is that
I should sue someone. That's what happened.
So I'm on my way to the drugstore, and I have to stop to get some gas
and there is this total pump malfunction.
You know what? She shouldn't be in this room.
I mean, this is supposedly green, but you know how it is.
You can close the windows in the nursery
because it's really only out here.
This is as good as it gets.
So, uh...
pump malfunction?
Yeah. I'm standing there filling up like I've done a thousand times
and I hear a chunk. You know, the pump's nozzle.
The metal thing. The thing you squeeze?
I hear a chunk. So I suppose, in my naivetÃ©
I took to understand that gas is no longer coming out of the nozzle
so I pull out the hose to put it back and whoosh!
Yeah, I am suddenly soaked in gasoline.
I mean, on my arms and my legs and my groin.
So now I am in a panic. I race home, I run inside the house,
and I'm stripping off my clothes as fast as I can.
I jump in the shower.
It's not until after I get out of the shower
that I realize my gas-covered clothes
have been soaking in the living room rug this entire time.
I mean, it's-- It's-- The whole thing is just so stupid.
I could have rinsed off at the station.
Halfway home, I started to realize,
wait a minute, there's a water hose right there next to the air pump.
You know, for tires.
Anyway, so that was my day.
How was yours?
Dad? Yeah.
Please, can you just tell the truth?
Tell-- What do you mean?
You fainted, didn't you?
Because you're sick again?
You were pumping gas, and the fumes,
they made you pass out again.
Just-- Just admit it.
No, the-- No.
It was the pump.
All right, I...
Maybe I did get a little swimmy at one point
but I did not faint. Okay?
I'm fine, and that's the truth.
However, in the best interest of all of our continued good health,
I don't think we can stay here.
I mean, not until we get new carpet.
Yeah.
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie, they got plenty of space.
Hey, what about a hotel?
A hotel. That could be sweet.
A good one.
I like the way you're thinking. Yes.
Could be a little family vacation.
Might be fun. What do you say?
Why don't you put some clothes together.
Yeah. All right.
I'm sorry. It's not my finest hour.
I'll go pack a bag.
Okay. Okay.
Think this'll leave a scar?
I never should have let my dojo membership run out.
Jesus. Jesse did that?
Yeah, but you gotta understand, deep down he loves me.
So where is he?
Still looking. Where have you looked?
His place, his folk's place, this Brock kid's place.
Crack shacks at Siesta Hills, the Indigo, the Crystal Palace,
go-kart joint on Copper Ave,
AA meeting off the 40.
His buddies, Beaver and what's-his-name?
Badger and Skinny Pete. Yeah, no, he's not with them.
They could be covering for him.
I posed as a meter reader. I put a bug on the tall kid's mom's place.
For three hours straight, all he talked about was something called <i>Babylon 5.</i>
I checked with my gal at A.P.D.
Pinkman's not in their system
so the cops don't have him. Yet.
Maybe he changed his mind about leaving,
called your guy back.
Somebody misses their first chance with my guy, there's no second.
Well, keep looking.
What then?
What do you mean?
I mean, Pinkman's like a bad penny.
Sooner or later, he'll turn up.
I'm wondering what you wanna do when he does.
Jesse is upset about the boy.
I just need to explain to him why that had to happen.
Okay, but say, you know, just for the sake of argument,
the kid's not in the mood for a nuanced discussion
of the virtues of child poisoning.
His plans are running more towards stabbing you to death
with a pointed stick. In that scenario, then what?
You have a suggestion?
We were wondering if maybe this isn't an Old Yeller type situation.
Old Yeller?
Yeah, Old Yeller was the best, most loyal dog there ever was.
I mean, everybody loved that mutt
but one day he showed up rabid
and little Timmy, for Old Yeller's own sake,
had to, uh...
Oh, you-- You saw the movie.
You're full of colorful metaphors, aren't you, Saul?
Belize, Old Yeller...
Just brimming with advice.
Do not float that idea again.
Find him.
Sorry. Ah. Sorry.
Room key wouldn't let me into the ice room
so I had to go down to the front desk.
But here we are.
Checked in on Junior.
Heh. Pay-per-view and room service. He's in heaven.
Hey, I thought you were gonna take a bath.
How's Saul doing?
Saul? Goodman?
No idea. No?
You were just out talking to him in the parking lot.
I'm sorry. Were you spying on me?
Yes.
And I feel just awful about it too.
You know, I played along
with your pump malfunction bullshit
because Junior was standing right there,
but now I would like to know what's going on.
First of all, it's no big deal.
Coming here is just me being overly cautious.
Jesse Pinkman, you know?
He came over to our house that time for dinner, remember?
Well, he... He got upset over this...
Something he thinks I did.
I did do it.
But I did it for very good reasons. And it's just-- It's complicated.
Wait, are you...?
Are you telling me that he tried to
burn our house down?
That was...
probably, for a brief moment, his intention,
but, obviously, he changed his mind.
And how does that work?
Him--? Him changing his mind?
Ah, God.
Look...
You've got to understand that with Jesse,
there are emotional issues, personal issues, some drug abuse.
But he has always been more of a danger to himself than anyone else.
He has a tendency to fly off the handle, that's all.
So he has never hurt anybody?
No.
I can't believe you got her down so fast.
So...
what's your course of action here?
Saul's guy, Kuby, tracks him down, which shouldn't take long,
and when he does, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna talk to him.
Make him see reason.
Talk to him?
Make him see reason?
So I'm clear...
these are just euphemisms
you're using here, right?
No.
What?
Wh--? What does that mean?
My God. I knew this was going to happen.
I knew it. I told you that someday,
someone was going to come to our door and try to hurt us.
And now here we are.
No.
Jesse didn't go there to hurt anyone.
He poured gasoline all over our house, Walt.
He tried to set our house on fire.
He changed his mind. He didn't do it, did he?
What if he changes it back?
Walt, you need
to deal with this.
How much have you had to drink? Heh, heh.
Not nearly enough.
I don't know how we got off
on whatever it is we're talking about here...
but, clearly, I haven't explained the situation well enough
because this is a big overreaction.
We all need to just take a deep breath and calm down
because Jesse isn't just some...
Some-- Some rabid dog.
This is a person. A person that is a threat to us.
I mean, my God, where we are now with Hank and Marie
and that awful tape we made.
After everything we've done,
you can't just talk to this person.
You're saying...
that I just...
What--? What exactly are you saying?
We've come this far.
For us.
What's one more?
Jesse!
Stop what you're doing and turn and face me!
You wanna--? You wanna know what he did?
You wanna hear about it?
Jesse, put out the lighter.
He poisoned a little kid.
An 8-year-old boy.
Just because, you know--
Just as a move!
Walt's a bastard. Secret's out.
We'll talk about it.
But I need you to put out the lighter, okay?
Look, Jesse...
Jesse, I don't wanna kill you.
And you don't wanna be killed.
So put it out.
He can't keep getting away with it!
He can't keep getting away with it!
He won't.
You really wanna burn him down?
Let's do it together.
You were following me?
Yeah. Since Goodman's.
Where we going now?
DEA. Downtown.
What, I'm, like, arrested?
Yeah, you know how this works.
Be a good witness for me,
it'll go better for you.
Yeah, sitting around MDC,
waiting to be a witness against Mr. White.
It's... Heh.
It's gonna go great for me.
So...
you're angry.
I can't sleep. I'm not eating.
Last night, I was online for six hours looking up untraceable poisons.
This close family friend
had been keeping a secret from you and Hank,
and somehow this person's secret became known,
and now you're sad and hurt and angry.
I'm--? I'm in the ballpark?
To be this wrong about someone.
This off.
We all lead double lives to some extent, don't we?
We all have our secrets. Yeah. Not like this.
Not like him.
Marie, I think it's time you filled me in on some more details here.
Who and what are we talking about?
I said I can't do that.
It'd be bad for Hank.
Our friend made that clear in his little movie.
Those kids...
under his roof. That baby.
I'm sick just thinking about it.
How could I have not seen this?
If I weren't being such a...
idiotic-- Stupid idiot, I could've--
We could have...
Blackjack winnings.
Nothing suspicious about that at all.
Tell me about this movie.
Dave, can we simply
just focus on my feelings here?
The details don't really matter, do they? There's nothing to be done, okay?
He screwed us and he won.
Can we just...?
Can we talk about something else, please?
Yes?
How's work?
Last week, you were upset about the new parking rules.
Marie?
Saxitoxin.
Derived from shellfish.
Produces a flaccid paralysis that leaves the victim conscious
through a progression of symptoms.
Death occurs from respiratory failure.
That is definitely a contender.
Marie,
you're not ready to fill me in here,
that's fine.
But I want you to listen.
There is no problem, no matter how difficult
or painful or seemingly unsolvable,
that violence won't make worse.
I know, I...
Don't worry. I wouldn't hurt anybody.
I just...
It just feels good to think about it.
Hey, babe. What's the story here?
Oh, well, something's come up.
I thought you might wanna get out of the house for a day or two.
You thought I'd pack up and move out of my own house.
Why? What's going on?
Look, I don't wanna get into it now.
But you know that thing with Walt, there's...
There's been a development.
What happened? Are you in danger? No, no, no, not at all.
Just-- It's a fluid situation.
I think it might go a little smoother if you're not here.
So I... It's gonna be great, you know?
I booked you a spa package at La Posada.
You can do that river-stones thing. Hank, what the hell is going on?
Hank?
We have a guest.
He was a little keyed up. Gave him a couple sleeping pills.
Okay. Okay, so listen.
I bring that kid in, put him in the system,
Walt's gonna find out five minutes later. You know?
My last 10 witnesses died in jail, remember?
And I can't use a DEA safe house without writing him up.
I can't risk a motel.
I know it sounds crazy, but this is the best place.
For now. Just a day or two, tops--
Okay, just answer me this one question:
Is this bad for Walt?
Yeah. Very.
Good. I'm staying. I'll heat up lasagna.
Phone's ringing.
<i>You have one new message.</i>
<i>Jesse, listen. Uh...</i>
<i>I mean, obviously, you've changed your mind here</i>
<i>and so thank you for that.</i>
<i>And I know you're angry.</i>
<i>I wanna fix this, okay?</i>
<i>Whatever it takes, all right?</i>
<i>We'll talk, and we will fix this.</i>
<i>Until then, just...</i>
<i>Just sleep it off, okay?</i>
<i>And then call me.</i>
<i>Be safe.</i>
Hey.
Hey.
What are you still doing up?
Couldn't sleep.
Ah. You and me both. Here. Have a seat.
Everything okay? Oh, yeah.
Just business stuff.
Going over some options.
You guys still think you might buy another car wash?
Oh, uh-- Yeah. Well, maybe.
See how it goes.
How it goes now that--
Now that you're-- You're sick again, right?
No. That's not what I mean.
Hey. Told you not to worry, remember?
How--? How can I not worry?
Come on. You think I came all this way
just to let something as silly as lung cancer take me down?
Not a chance.
I'm not going anywhere.
Should've brought our suits, huh?
It's okay.
It's all right.
I'll be up in a minute.
Okay.
See you in the morning. Okay.
Would you like some coffee?
Morning.
You want some coffee?
No. The lady, um...
I think your wife...
You take cream and sugar?
Uh-- Black's-- Black's good.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thanks.
This is probably gonna take a while.
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll run some errands. Okay.
All right.
Uh... You remember Agent Gomez?
How you feeling? Your head clear? Yeah.
This-- This can't be what you mean by burning him to the ground, right?
I got stories that'll make your toes curl,
but, you know, it's just "my word against his word" kind of stuff.
So, you know, I don't really have any, like, proof or anything.
Gomey, can you grab the curtains over there?
There's a glare thing happening here.
You know he's retired, right? He's...
He's not even in the business anymore.
So you're never gonna catch him with a camcorder.
We're gonna catch him. We gotta do this first, okay? Come on.
Just tell us everything you remember.
Any business dealings, any personal dealings,
any criminal activity you were a witness or a party to.
Anything and everything.
Just tell us your story, okay?
Start from the beginning. When did you first meet Walter White?
Right. Okay, uh...
I first met Mr. White--
Walter White.
-in junior year chemistry.
He was my teacher.
You believe him?
Yeah. I do, unfortunately.
And I hate to admit it, but I think the kid is right.
There is no physical evidence, not that I heard.
Yeah, well, no weapons, no bodies, no working lab.
Just the word of one nut-job meth-head
against Mr. Rogers-Has-a-Lung-Tumor.
So do we take a run at Lydia Rodarte-Quayle?
Vamonos Pest? Follow up with the Drew Sharp killing?
Where do we start?
I say we start with this.
<i>Jesse...</i>
<i>I'm gonna be at Civic Plaza tomorrow at noon.</i>
<i>I hope you'll give me the chance to explain myself</i>
<i>and talk through everything once and for all.</i>
<i>I'll be alone and unarmed.</i>
<i>So if you wanna come and shoot me in the head, that's up to you.</i>
<i>Either way...</i>
<i>I'm in your hands.</i>
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go and talk to that asshole?
You can't be serious.
Go and listen. He wants to explain himself.
We put a wire on you and let him explain.
So your plan is to do his plan?
You seriously think that this--?
This whole "once and for all in the plaza" thing
is so he can talk to me?
Why not?
I-- I-- I can't believe you two.
The dude wanted me out of town before I came to burn his house down,
and now I'm more of a threat to him.
And he's got a zero-tolerance policy on threats, you know?
If I go to this plaza, I'm a dead man, is why not.
Hey, Walt's ruthless.
He'll do just about anything to protect his interests.
I agree. Except when it comes to you.
He cares about you. Heh.
Can't you see?
Oh, yeah. You mean when he's not ripping me off or calling me an idiot
or poisoning people that I care about?
Yeah, no, Mr. White's gay for me. Everyone knows that.
No, I mean it. Based on everything you told us.
Uh, he paid for your rehab,
ran over those two drug dealers with his car.
Sounds like he saved your life.
Made you a 50-50 partner. He didn't need to do that.
Yeah, he sort of did. I'm the only one near as good as him.
I don't know. The way you tell it,
sounds like he's manipulating you to stick around.
Like he doesn't wanna lose you. All those numbers he runs on you
over and over, helping you find the ricin cigarette.
Look how far he'll go to show you--
To convince you that he's not such a bad guy.
That's what this is. What if it's about, um,
killing me, you know?
You know, getting me out in the open,
hire some, uh-- Some clock-tower guy
or have me sit on a poisoned needle or something, you know?
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
The plaza's one of the most wide-open public places in all of Albuquerque.
It's the middle of the day.
And Agent Gomez and I will be right there with you.
Look, you two guys are just guys, okay?
Mr. White, he's the devil.
You know, he is. He is smarter than you,
he is luckier than you.
Whatever-- Whatever you think is supposed to happen,
I'm telling you, the exact reverse opposite of that
is gonna happen, okay?
Jesse, Jesse, we're not brainstorming here.
This is not asking.
Unless you know another way to get the man or you wanna take your chances
with the banger boys over in MDC, then this is it.
This is what's happening.
I gotta piss. Can I piss? Yeah. Down to the left.
You got another SD card?
What? What if the kid's right?
What if it's a trap?
The kid?
Oh, you mean the junkie murderer
that's dribbling all over my guest bathroom floor?
Well, then, he's right.
Pinkman gets killed,
and we get it all on tape.
Remember, you're hurt, angry, but you're here for answers, okay?
But don't... Don't push the questions.
Okay? Let's not get him suspicious, all right?
You let him do the talking, right?
Just relax. That's what matters most.
Don't cross your arms, if you can help it.
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.
<i>Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek. You getting that?</i>
Loud and clear, <i>idiota. How's it looking, Gomey?</i>
No change.
<i>He's just sitting there.</i>
<i>Are we doing this, or what?</i>
Ready to kick some ass, partner?
All right. Time to go.
Okay.
Hey, Hank, you got eyes on this? What's with the kid?
He's just standing there.
<i>What the hell is he doing?</i>
He's on the move now. He's taking off. I think he's running.
Oh, no, no, no, kid. Come on.
You got him? He's at the pay phone.
Who the hell is he calling?
Oh, no, no, no. Come on, kid.
No. Come on.
Hello?
Nice try, asshole.
Jesse, where are you?
I just wanna talk.
No. I'm not doing what you want anymore. Okay, asshole?
<i>This is just a heads-up to let you know I'm coming for you.</i>
See, I decided that burning down your house is nothing.
Next time, I'm gonna get you where you really live.
Jesse, listen.
Jesse? Jesse?
Daddy! Daddy! Hey!
Get in.
Son of a bitch! Stupid, high little--
What the hell was that all about?
What were you thinking?
Thinking there's another way. What?
To get him. There's another way.
A better way.
Hey.
It's Walt.
I'm okay.
I, uh...
Todd...
I think I might have another job for your uncle.
ï»¿1
How big's the batch?
Should be about 50 pounds, give or take.
Uncle Jack, that mask,
I think you should...
Mr. White said the fumes aren't good to breathe.
Let me worry about what I breathe, kid.
Just hurry this up so I can grab a smoke. Ahem.
Seventy-six percent. Ha.
Nice going, nephew. Thanks, Uncle Jack.
Where's the blue?
Where's the what? The blue color.
Does it come later, when this hardens?
Where is it?
I am correct in assuming this should be blue?
See, I'm thinking the headline here should be "76 percent."
Yeah. Whole lot more than it was.
That dude who looked like Wolverine? He couldn't crack 70.
Fine. Yes, percentage-wise, it's marginally improved.
And congratulations, Todd.
But blue is our brand, all over Europe.
It's what our buyers pay top dollar for.
If we're down a bit in purity from the Heisenberg days,
maybe they'll let us slide on that, but not if it's not blue.
I don't know. To my eye,
it's kind of blue. Yeah, a little.
It's bluish.
Todd, you're the chef. What do you think?
Yeah, kind of.
If it catches the light just right,
I could see how you'd think there's a touch of blue,
blue-green in there.
Aquamarine.
Hell, we'll put food coloring in it. Make it any damn shade you want.
Yeah, like they do farm-raised salmon. Yeah.
I mean, Jesus, you ever see how pink they make that crap?
Like, flamingo pink.
It sure as hell don't come out the ocean looking like that.
All right. Let's make some money.
Here you go, Ms. Quayle. Lydia.
Thank you.
Is the tea okay? I made it just like you asked.
Mm-hm.
You sure? If it's too weak or something, I can go put another bag in it.
I'm sure.
Look, about the product,
I'm really sorry about the color.
For a minute or two, it just got a few degrees too hot
in the mixing kettle, I think.
I might've just cooked the color right out of it.
You burned it, like a cake.
Yeah, sort of, I guess.
But the point is I think I can fix it,
and I think I can bring the purity up too.
I mean, I'm doing everything just like Mr. White taught me, so...
You know, it's bound to get better, right?
I appreciate you making every possible effort
because, as you know, my buyers expect a certain threshold,
a continuity.
Yeah. Yeah, totally.
About your buyers,
I could ask my uncle to smooth things over with them,
if you want.
I'll pass. Thanks.
I've put a lot of faith in your abilities, Todd.
I believe in you.
Please do make the cook better.
It's very important to me.
I've got a flight to catch.
Hello. <i>Hey. It's Walt.</i>
Hey, Mr. White. How you doing?
<i>I'm okay.</i>
<i>I, uh...</i>
<i>Todd, I think I might have anotherjob for your uncle.</i>
Oh, okay. You want me to set up a meeting?
<i>I-- Yes. Please. Let's do that.</i>
Any heads-up I should give him, like
which jail, how many targets, stuff like that?
Mr. White? <i>Just one target.</i>
<i>Not currently in jail.</i>
<i>Jesse Pinkman.</i>
You got it.
I'm surprised you didn't strangle him. So now what? Book him?
I'm sure the AUSA will have plenty to say about how to play him against Walt.
Knowing what we know about how Walt deals with rats behind bars?
Punk has to be safer with the marshals
than out here where it's open season.
What does that mean? What are you thinking?
The kid's got an idea.
What kid? That kid? Timmy Dipshit there?
The one that screwed up our sting? I'm all ears.
Just hear him out, would you?
Okay, genius, what's the idea?
You guys need evidence to put him away.
Only he's too smart to leave any out there, right?
So you say.
Well, I know some evidence
that greedy asshole would never destroy.
His money.
You know where he keeps his money? No.
But I know someone who might.
Oh, hey. How'd it go?
Trailed him to the Dog House, picked him up there.
Seemed to be looking for someone. Had a lot of questions.
No calls though, right?
You got his phone? Yeah.
He's on ice? Safe house off Rio Bravo.
We've got Van Oster babysitting him.
Yeah. What about Van Oster? Did he have any questions?
Probably, but he knows better than to ask.
Good job.
I gotta tell you this up front, Hank.
If this guy decides he wants to lawyer up,
I don't care if you are my boss, I'm gonna put a stop to this.
He won't lawyer up.
What the hell, man?
You're up.
Hey there. You mind taking it outside for a minute?
No, sir. You got it. All right, thanks.
Huell Babineaux.
Know who I am?
I'll take that as a yes.
Thanks for your patience.
Uh, as Agent Gomez said, you're not under arrest.
Why am I here?
Well, you're here, um, for your own protection, sir.
How you figure that?
Well, we both know how dangerous my brother-in-law can be.
Nice poker face.
Look, uh, relax.
There's not much new you can tell me about Walter White.
Multiple murders,
ties to a white-power prison gang,
ran the largest meth racket in the entire Southwest.
I'm not asking, you're not answering,
whoop-de-do. Let's cut to the chase.
We have a wire on Walt's phone.
We intercepted a call between him and a certain Saul Goodman, Esq.
You know, your employer?
Anyway, in the call, Walt said that he was going to, quote:
"Take care of one Jesse Pinkman," unquote,
and that you were next on the hit list. That's why you're here.
Bullshit. That don't make no sense.
I got the recording. I can-- I can let you hear it.
Your associate, Goodman's fixer-- What's his name?
Some carrottop named Patrick Kuby.
Boston P.D. ran him out of Beantown a few years back.
Came out here for the sunshine.
Walt said he was gonna do this Kuby guy the same way he does you.
In fact, Kuby's already missing.
Sorry to say, things are looking grim for your-- Your redheaded buddy.
Believe us, don't believe us. Suit yourself.
Whatever you do, I would not call Goodman.
He sold you down the river bigtime.
The hell you talking about?
Don't take it personally.
Goodman's next on the chopping block if he doesn't do what White says.
To be fair, your circus clown of a boss did try to spare you for all of, what,
about, uh, 15 seconds,
before he decided to help Walt track you down.
You see, Goodman's got a trace on your phone,
and as soon as you call him,
Walt will find out where you're hiding.
Then it's just a matter of time before you end up like this.
Oh, man. Oh, man. I swear to God, I didn't know he was gonna kill him, man.
I didn't know he was gonna kill him. Relax.
If we thought you did, you'd be in lockup
for conspiracy to commit murder instead of under our protection.
Tell us everything you know so we can get him before he gets you.
Why would he wanna kill me?
I ain't do nothing. Who knows with this guy?
From what he said, it may have to do
with him tying up loose ends regarding poisoning some kid named Brock.
Or maybe it's because you know where his money is.
I don't know where his money is.
That ain't what we heard.
You ain't listening to the people in the know.
Me and Kuby rented a van for the dude,
loaded his cash up in a self-storage unit,
handed over the keys to him at Goodman's.
Who knows where he took it from there?
A van, huh? How much money we talking?
Seven barrels' worth.
Seven barrels?
When you say "barrels," you mean "barrels" barrels?
Barrels, man. You know, plastic, black, 55-gallon type.
I got them at Home Depot.
Filled up every last damn one of them too.
And, uh, where did you rent the van?
Lariat. The one on Candelaria and Monroe.
Lariat on Candelaria? Yeah.
Kuby rented the van. Mr. White dropped it off.
He had us wash it good before Kuby took it back.
Wash the rental? Why?
It was filthy, man, like he went off-road with it.
After we had hosed it down, he grabbed a shovel out the back,
handed over the key, and that was it.
That's all I know.
All right, Mr. Babineaux.
Agent Gomez and I are going to do everything we can
to find this son of a bitch.
Like I said, you're free to go.
But if I were you, I wouldn't take one step out that door.
And remember, no phone calls.
Oh, actually, I almost forgot.
Uh, I took the liberty of removing the battery
so Walt can't track you by GPS.
So don't put that back in.
Agent Van Oster will stay here with you.
You're in good hands. He's our best man with a gun.
Uh, don't discuss the case with him because the less you distract him,
the better he can protect you.
How long you gonna be?
As long as it takes to keep you safe.
So just one guy this time.
Not even in lockup.
Some former partner, Todd says?
Yeah.
So, what are we talking, rat patrol?
Rat p--?
No, no.
Rat patrol? No. No, he's not a rat.
He's just...
He just won't listen to reason.
Okay. He's just angry.
He's not a rat.
All right.
Angry non-rat. Got it.
How angry we talking, by the way?
Like, Hulk angry?
Like, Rambo-James Bond badass individual?
Not something you'd do yourself, huh?
Jesse is like family to me.
Look, I want what you do to be quick and painless.
No suffering, no fear.
Bullet to the back of the head. Something he doesn't see coming.
I respect that.
There's too many savages out there. Let's just talk about the money.
No, we don't want your money.
We want you to cook for us.
You know I'm out of the business.
Just a couple times to tutor my nephew here, that's all.
Get him on track to bringing the purity up.
Get the color right too.
Apparently that blue touch you put on it,
it's all the craze with those Slavic types.
So I'm told. No.
Absolutely not.
Look, what was the price per head last time? I'll triple it.
A drop in the bucket compared to what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.
Don't skimp on family, that's what I always say.
You want us to do this job?
Do it right? That's the price.
One cook,
after the job is done.
Time is of the essence. Do you understand?
Do him tonight if you want.
Just tell me where he is.
I don't know where he is,
but I know how to flush him out.
You want string cheese or yogurt squeezers with your PBJ?
Both.
I didn't hear you. Both, please.
Hold on, honey.
Hi, Andrea. I don't know if you remember me.
I'm Walter White, Jesse's friend.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. Hi. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, hi. Hi.
I'm sorry to just barge in on you like this,
but, uh, I was hoping that I could have a moment to talk with you.
It's about Jesse.
Um, sure. I'm sort of rushing around right now.
Wanna talk inside while I get my boy ready?
Oh, well, yeah. If it's-- If it's okay, yeah, sure.
Thank you.
You met Brock before, right? Yes. Yes, I have. At Jesse's.
How you doing, Brock?
Brock, he asked you a question.
I'm good. Good.
Froot Loops.
That's good stuff.
So Jesse...
Yeah, I...
I don't wanna alarm you,
but I've been trying to reach him for days.
I've stopped at his house,
I've left all kinds of messages on his voicemail,
and he won't return my calls. I can't find him anywhere.
Have you heard from him?
No, not since the last time he called to check on Brock.
That was, I don't know,
two weeks ago, maybe.
Andrea,
Jesse's using again, and I...
I have a bad feeling about this.
Have you tried calling the police?
Or a better idea.
Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman. I have his card somewhere.
I mean, he may have ways of finding Jesse without getting him in trouble.
"Better call Saul." Yeah. I-- I did that.
He was able to verify that Jesse's not locked up,
but, otherwise, very little help.
You see, the thing is,
is that Jesse and I had this argument recently.
And I won't bore you with the details, but he's...
He's-- He's pretty upset with me and, um...
And I'm hoping that's the reason he hasn't called me back
instead of him being...
Well...
Well, I'll try him right now.
I mean, if that's it, he's mad at you,
maybe I'll have better luck. That would be such a help. Yes.
What--? What--? What number are you calling him on?
His cell. You know, he recently got a new one.
And there. That--
That's his new number there, the highlighted one.
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.
Your friend Walter just dropped by. He's here at the house right now.
We-- We're thinking of you.
Call me back as soon as you get this message.
I really need to hear from you.
It's important.
Thank you, Andrea.
I appreciate that.
Well, I better-- I better be going.
You're welcome to stay a few minutes to see if he calls back.
No, no, no. You're trying to get your son off to school.
If he does happen to call back, would you call me?
Better yet, I've got your number. I'll call you back, okay?
And thank you.
See you, Brock.
We on?
Yes. It should be any time now.
<i>Copy that.</i>
Remember, fast and painless. And take him away from here.
I don't want the mother or the boy to know.
<i>You got it.</i>
<i>Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.</i>
<i>Your friend Walterjust dropped by. He's here at the house right now.</i>
<i>We-- We're thinking of you.</i>
<i>Call me back as soon as you get this message.</i>
<i>I really need to hear from you.</i>
<i>It's important.</i>
Nice try, asshole.
How'd it go at the rental place? Van have GPS?
No GPS. Nope.
They used to have GPS until about six months ago
when the ACLU or somebody sued them
and they had to get rid of it.
Well, that's it. Game over.
Yo, man, you can't just give up on this.
Who said we're giving up? What do you got?
Just thinking about what Babineaux said
about the van being dirty
and the shovel that Walt had with him.
I'll bet you 10-to-1 he buried that money.
No kidding. So what?
There's a whole lot of desert out there. How we gonna find the spot?
You said it yourself, there's no GPS on the van.
Yeah. But Walt doesn't know that.
All right.
Here's your change.
Oh, count it out, please. Here.
Uh, three. That makes 15.
Plus 5, that is 20.
Give this to your car wash professional. Thank you.
Say it.
Have an A-1 day. Oh, you too.
Good. Why--? Why do I--?
Who do I gotta say that?
Because it reinforces our brand.
So getting the hang of it?
It's, uh-- It's pretty basic.
Mom, it's Saturday.
Can--? Can I go?
Go where? Home.
Pick up a few things, maybe chill for a little bit.
I'm sure the smell is gone by now.
Why don't you just stick around here for a while longer?
I need you. Hi.
Uh, who do I give this to? Um...
You know what? I'll take care of it. Excuse me, son.
That'll be 14.97, please.
Hey. How you doing?
You're on our billboard. You're--
You're the lawyer guy, yeah. "Better call Saul!"
Heh, heh.
Okay.
So 3 makes 15, and 20, 25, 30,
35, 40, and 10 makes 50. Thank you.
I like your commercial.
What--? What happened to your face?
Oh, this is a-- I guess you'd call it an occupational hazard.
Thank you, and please give that to your car wash professional.
Very good. Thank you very much. Good to meet you.
Yeah. Don't drink and drive.
Okay. But if you do, call me.
Ahem. Have an A-1 day.
Mom, you forgot to say it.
Yeah. Yeah, I did. Okay.
Make sure you get in there between the cushions, all right?
That's it. Way in there. Attaboy.
What the hell you doing here?
I swear to God, the kid left so much booger powder in there
my Caddy is a K-9 unit's wet dream.
Is your phone broken? All 200 of them?
Huell's gone.
Huell's gone where?
No idea. AWOL. Nobody's seen him. He's not answering his phone.
So, what about Jesse?
He hasn't shown up yet.
He will, Saul. He's probably high as a kite
and hasn't gotten our message yet.
Or he got it loud and clear, figured out it's a setup.
The kid is not as dumb as you think.
Are you wearing a bulletproof vest?
Did you miss the part about my bodyguard has gone missing?
Look, I had him watching the Dog House,
figuring the kid might show up.
Next thing I know, radio silence.
You're the math whiz. Add up two and two.
Jesse is not on some killing spree.
It's me he wants.
It's just me.
Well, then where the hell's Huell?
Any news? Not yet, but soon. I promise.
Have an A-1 day.
Next,
inventory lists.
These are the inventory lists. Every day, after close of business,
you tally the total of every item sold
and you mark it under the appropriate column.
So say we sold, I don't know, 10 pine-scented air fresheners.
You mark "10" under this column
and then you subtract 10 from the stock column.
Okay? Why don't you try that?
Jesse?
<i>Got my photo, bitch?</i>
<i>That barrel look familiar?</i>
<i>Because I just found six more exactly like it.</i>
<i>That big bastard who works for Goodman,</i>
<i>I pistol-whipped that melon he calls a head</i>
<i>till he gave up what he knew, which led me to your rental van,</i>
<i>which, it turns out, had GPS.</i>
<i>How do you like that, genius? Guess you didn't think of everything.</i>
Look, Jesse, I don't know what you plan on doing here, but--
<i>Well, I'll give you a hint, Walt.</i>
<i>It involves a couple of five-gallon cans of gasoline and a lighter.</i>
No, no, no! Jesse, please, listen to me.
<i>No, you listen to me, bitch.</i>
<i>You get your ass out here as fast as you can.</i>
Yes, I'm coming. Okay! Okay!
<i>And don't even think about calling anyone for help, all right?</i>
<i>You hang up on me, put me on hold,</i>
<i>lose my call for any reason,</i>
<i>as soon as you do, I'm burning all of it.</i>
<i>All right? One big bonfire. You get the picture?</i>
I get it, I get it. Okay. <i>All right. You better hurry,</i>
<i>because I'm burning 10 grand a minute</i>
<i>till you get here, starting right now.</i>
I said, I'm coming! Don't you touch my money!
<i>Fire in the hole, bitch. There goes 10 G's.</i>
<i>Oh, nice orange flames.</i> No, no, no!
Jesse-- Jesse, please.
I'm dying. My cancer is back.
You're not hurting anyone but my family. Okay?
I can't spend this money.
It's not for me. I won't be around long enough to use it.
It belongs to my children.
<i>Oh, you're gonna talk about kids.</i>
<i>You're seriously gonna go there?</i>
I am sorry about Brock.
<i>No, you're not.</i>
I am. <i>You're not, but you're gonna be.</i>
Yes, I am sorry about Brock!
But he's alive, isn't he?
He's fine, just as I planned it!
Don't you think I knew exactly how much to give him?
That I had it all measured out? Come on!
Don't you know me by now? <i>I know you're a lying, evil scumbag,</i>
<i>that's what I know.</i>
<i>Manipulating people,</i>
<i>messing with their heads.</i> Open your eyes!
Can't you see that I needed you on my side to kill Gus?
I ran over those gangbangers!
I killed Emilio and Krazy-8! Why?
I did all of those things to try to save your life
as much as mine.
Only you're too stupid to know it!
Jesse.
Jesse!
Jesse, talk to me.
Jesse!
Jesse, I didn't hang up! Jesse!
Jesse?
Jesse, I'm here. Where are you?
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch!
No. No. No, no, no.
Come on, come on.
Yes.
Yeah?
It's me. I've got Jesse in sight,
and he's coming for me right now.
<i>He knows I'm alone.</i>
Let's go, boy. <i>I'm guessing he's got backup.</i>
How many guys? <i>I do-- I-- I don't know.</i>
Where are you? <i>To'hajiilee.</i>
<i>An Indian reservation west of town.</i>
<i>Get a pen.</i> Go.
Okay.
Okay.
"Thirty-four, 59, 20,
<i>106, 36, 52."</i>
Those are coordinates.
<i>If you want me around to cook for you,</i>
you get here now. <i>You got it.</i>
As fast as you can. Okay. Wait.
They're coming.
Looks like there could be three men total.
Wait a minute.
What? What is it?
Stay in the car.
Oh, my God.
<i>Walter, what is it?</i>
<i>Walter, you still there?</i>
<i>Walter?</i>
<i>Walter, you got eyes on him?</i>
<i>What do you see?</i>
<i>Walter, talk to me.</i>
Forget it.
Don't come.
What do you mean, "don't come"?
<i>It's off.</i>
Do not come.
Walt!
Come on out!
Walt!
Walt!
I know you're out here!
It's over!
Walt!
Come on out, Walt!
Got him.
Drop it!
Hands up!
Walk towards me slowly!
Stop.
Turn around.
Lace your fingers behind your head.
Walk backwards to me.
Stop.
Get on your knees.
How'd you like my barrel photo, huh?
Took it in the backyard by the barbecue grill.
You know, where we used to cook out with the family.
Gomey thought the dirt might not match. But me?
I bet your greedy ass would be so worked up
about the prospect of losing your cash
that you wouldn't catch it.
Looks like I was right.
He's clean.
Yo, I remember this place.
It's the very first place we cooked, like, ever.
It is, isn't it?
Hey, what say you save us the busywork, Walt,
and point out the spot where you buried your money?
No?
No matter.
I'll get a search team out here. We'll find it.
Agent Gomez, should we flip a coin for the honors?
No way, man. It's all yours.
Walter White,
you have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you
in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an attorney
and have an attorney present during questioning.
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you at the government's expense.
Do you understand these rights as I have just recited them to you?
Coward.
Get-- Get over here!
Bring it!
Get in the truck, will you? Bring it, bitch!
Put him in the car! Come on! Come on!
Get in the car! Hurry up!
Get in the car, kid. Come on.
Gonna take him down for booking, okay?
You should stay here till I come back with a search team.
You got it. I'd take the kid with me,
but they'd probably kill each other on the way.
Congratulations, buddy. Hey.
I'll call the tribal police, let them know we're here.
Gonna make a phone call.
Hank, why is there what looks like brains in our garbage can?
Hey, baby. I got him.
Dead to rights.
You got Walt? <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>I got him in handcuffs as we speak.</i>
<i>Want me to wave to him for you?</i>
Heh, heh. Well, he's not--
He's not feeling too friendly.
Oh, my God.
You did it.
Thank God.
Things are gonna be a little rough for the next couple weeks,
but they'll get better.
Baby, you okay?
I'm much better now.
I gotta go.
It may be a while before I get home.
I love you.
I love you too.
Who the hell is this?
Tribal police?
Hank! Hank! Hank!
No--
Police! Drop your weapons!
Jack, don't do it!
Jack!
Drop your weapons!
You heard the man! Put them down!
How do we know you're cops?
Show us some ID!
Damn straight! Let's see some badges!
Jack!
Jack, don't do it!
Jack!
No, Jack, it's off! Jack!
We'll give ourselves up, you show us some badges!
Simple as that!
How about it?
No!
Jack!
Jack, it's off! Forget it!
Jack!

Yo, so, what's next?
We wait.
We don't got like eight more anal things we gotta do first?
The reaction has begun.
Yeah, I know. So how long?
Well, if we had a freezer, the condensed liquid would cool more quickly
because, of course, this is an exothermic reaction, which means
"giving off heat."
And our desired product is...
Put me into a coma, why don't you?
What did you just say?
What? What? Nothing.
Huh.
No, no, no. Not in here.
Duh. Like I'm an idiot.
Yeah. Like you're an idiot.
Dick.
Aah.
God. Jesus. God.
Shut up.
Oh, wow.
Bogdan. Bogdan says I'm not doing the receipts right.
Well, he's got a bug up his butt.
He's got a stick up his butt?
He's got a bug up his butt about the receipts, anyways.
So anyway, he's insisting that I--
He's demanding that I stay
and look over his system
and I cannot get out of it.
Yeah.
Hello. <i>Hi, honey. It's me.</i>
Hey, you. What's going on? <i>Nothing much.</i>
I was just calling to say I'm sorry
but I'm gonna be late tonight.
Bogdan. He's got a bug up his butt.
That's okay. I wasn't planning anything special for dinner, so...
In fact, you could take pity on us and bring a pizza home.
They're having a two-for-one at Venezia's.
At this point, I could eat a whole one by myself.
Yeah, yeah, sure. I can pick up a pizza.
Hopefully Bogdan won't keep me too late.
He better not. Trust me, he does not want to piss off a hungry pregnant woman.
Ooh, what's that sound? <i>I just sold your favorite piece.</i>
The hideous crying clown. <i>Wow.</i>
Yeah, and I got 9 bucks more than I paid for it.
Shows what I know about art.
<i>Hey, what do you think about Holly?</i>
<i>For the baby's name.</i>
Do you like it?
I think I really like it.
Holly. Yeah, it's nice.
Let me think about it.
Just feels right, you know? It's my new favorite.
Well, it's a front-runner, for sure.
Listen, I was thinking, um, maybe we can have a little family time this weekend.
<i>Oh, yeah?</i> Yeah.
You know, just take a drive.
The almost four of us. Ha-ha-ha.
<i>Maybe we can head up the Turquoise Trail,</i>
<i>stop at Tinkertown, maybe grab some lunch in Madrid.</i>
Oh, my God. We haven't been there in forever.
<i>I know.</i> Yeah.
<i>So why don't we just do that? Take a little break?</i>
<i>Sold. Sounds fun.</i>
Holly. It's growing on me.
Yep. Me too.
All right, well, I had better go and get this in the mail.
<i>Why don't you call me when you're on your way home?</i>
Will do. Love you. <i>Love you too.</i>
Whoa, simmer down there, sparky.
What the hell did we just walk into?
Hey, Uncle Jack, I don't see Jesse Pinkman.
He was right here before.
Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?
No.
What do you figure? He maybe headed down that gully there?
That's the way I'd go.
Frankie, Lester, go find him.
Jack.
These guys are DEA.
No! Jack, no!
Jack! Jack! Jack!
No! No, don't!
Jack, don't. No.
No, Jack, Jack, Jack! Jack, no!
Jack, no. Don't kill him. Uh-uh-uh. Back it up.
Don't kill him, Jack. Get back here.
The hell not? He's DEA.
No, he's family.
Say again?
He's my family.
He's my brother-in-law.
Didn't cross your mind to maybe tell us
you had a DEA agent for a brother-in-law?
Did you know about this? I called you off, remember?
I told you not to come. Well, it seems to me we did you a solid.
You weren't supposed to be here.
Too late now.
How's about you telling me what was going down out here? Hm?
You and your brother-in-law don't seem to be getting along too well.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't concern you.
We just wasted his partner here, and he's wearing a bullet,
so, yeah, I'd say it does concern me.
This is between him and me.
No cavalry coming?
No.
You bet your ass the cavalry's coming.
No, no, no! Jack--
Jack! No, the DEA doesn't know about this.
Not yet.
Hank.
Nothing can change what just happened,
but you can walk out of here alive
if you just promise us that you'll let this go.
Yeah, I thought as much.
Sorry, man. Just no scenario where this guy lives.
No, no, no, listen! I have money!
I have money! It's buried out here. It's...
It's $80 million.
Eighty million.
Hm. So that's what got this party started, huh?
But this money of yours won't do me much good in prison.
You can go anywhere. You can do anything. Think about it.
You can have any future that you want.
Jack.
Eighty million.
And all you've got to do
is let him go.
That's a hell of an offer.
What do you think, fed?
Would you take that deal?
It's Hank.
His name is Hank.
How about it, Hank?
Should I let you go?
My name is ASAC Schrader.
And you can go fuck yourself.
Hank, listen to me.
You gotta tell him.
You gotta tell him now that we can work this out.
Please. Please.
What? You want me to beg?
You're the smartest guy I ever met.
And you're too stupid to see...
he made up his mind 10 minutes ago.
Do what you're gonna do.
Pretty specific directions.
Most people tell me to be somewhere, they say, "West on the 40,
this or that exit, second gas station on the left." You know?
This here? This is a whole other story.
That fancy phone of yours, where does it say this is exactly?
Yeah.
Look at this. They even brought a shovel.
Jack, no sign of Pinkman.
All right.
Says this is it right here.
Dig.
What's that? A barrel? Couple barrels?
Oh, Jesus.
Hell, yeah!
Oh, Jesus. Would you look at that? Ha-ha-ha.
Hell, yeah!
Goddamn.
Whoo!
What are you waiting for?
Yeah, boss. Hell, yeah.
Let me get on this side. Get that out of there, man.
Okay. Pull a barrel off the truck and load it in the Chrysler.
Seriously? Jack.
That's like 10 or 11 million right there. You sure you wanna do that?
You gonna make me say it again? Go, go.
Chop, chop.
Jesus, what's with all the greed here?
It's unattractive.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm leaving you a barrel.
Boys are gonna load it for you.
You got the keys to these cuffs?
I'm sorry for your loss.
My nephew here, he respects you.
He would never forgive me if things went another way.
Also you caught me in a good mood.
So here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna get in your car,
and you're gonna drive out of here, all right?
No hard feelings.
Understand me?
We square?
Hey, man, I gotta know we're square, or we're gonna have to go that other way.
Pinkman.
Pinkman.
You still owe me.
If you can find him, we'll kill him.
Found him.
No!
Get off me!
Get off!
No, no.
Good to go?
Hey, Uncle Jack.
Well, he was out here with those feds.
Right? Working with them. Should we maybe find out what he told them first?
Because, I mean, he had to have told them some stuff
that might not be too good for us.
And I'll bet we could
get it out of him back home.
I mean, I can do it.
Me and him, we got history.
And then, you know, we'd take care of the job after that.
Works for me. Work for you?
Let's go, pal. No.
No!
No!
No!
Wait.
I watched Jane die.
I was there.
And I watched her die.
I watched her overdose and choke to death.
I could have saved her.
But I didn't.
Hi. Hello.
That truck belong to you?
It does.
I'd like to buy it.
It's not for sale.
Hey, Walt, it's me. Um,
just thought I'd try you again.
We were just wondering when you thought you'd be back,
so just give us a call whenever you can.
Bye.
Hey, Aunt Marie.
Hey, sweetie.
Haven't seen you for a while. What have you been up to?
Oh, you know. This and that.
Your mom and I need to talk, so thought I'd stop by.
Well, I, uh, wish you'd called first.
This isn't the best time.
Well, Flynn looks like he can hold down the fort.
Why don't we go into your office?
I got it.
Okay, honey. Thanks.
Marie, I have nothing to say. Well, I do.
So you can just sit there and listen.
I got a call from Hank. He arrested Walt
three hours ago.
It's over.
"Dead to rights" I believe is the expression.
Hank and Steve Gomez are working with a former associate of Walt's,
Jesse Pinkman, whom I know you know,
and Pinkman has supplied them with everything they need.
Hank is booking Walt as we speak.
And I, for one, could not be happier.
I almost didn't come here.
Christ, I barely even know who you are,
and I sure as hell don't know if I can ever trust you again.
And then I think about how you were so upset with Walt
and how you wanted the kids out of the house,
and all of this makes me believe that there has got to be hope for you,
that whatever he did to you can be undone.
All I know, all I have been forcing myself to remember,
is that you are my sister.
And so I'm here.
Marie-- Everything changes now.
And you have got to prepare yourself.
Hank will help you as much as he can. I know he will.
And I will support you through this.
But I have conditions.
Give me every single copy of that obscenity
that the two of you made to discredit Hank.
That DVD. Every single copy.
You understand me?
Answer me. Do you understand me?
Yes.
Good.
Now dry your eyes and get Flynn in here.
You are going to tell him everything, and I mean everything.
He deserves to know the truth from his family.
Not a bunch of uniformed strangers.
No. No. No, he cannot know. You tell him,
or I will.
There's no way around this.
He needs to know, and he needs to know now.
No.
Look, I gave you what you wanted.
Come on, please.
Hey, please.
I told you where to find the tape, okay? Yup.
Hey, just go.
Just go there. Just go to his house and get it.
We're on it. Get it!
No one else knows about it. Just me and his partner.
Okay. No one else knows, I swear!
Let's cook.
You're completely out of your mind.
It's the truth. It is, Flynn.
Then both of you are out of your minds.
You're full of shit, is what you are. Both of you.
If this is true, then how could you keep this a secret?
I mean, why? Why would you go along?
I'll be asking myself that for the rest of my life.
So you're saying all this time you were lying about this?
I mean, so you're saying you're a liar.
You just admitted it.
So were you lying then, or are you lying now?
Which lie is it?
Flynn, honey,
your mother is telling you the truth.
Right here, right now. Believe it.
You know what? This is bullshit. This is bullshit.
Baby-- I wanna talk to Dad.
Your dad's in custody. You can't talk to him for a while.
I'm calling Uncle Hank. I've tried. He's not answering.
He's probably in the thick of it
with your father. Honey, I know this is a lot to process, Flynn,
but if you could just breathe, just try to breathe
and just trust-- Really? Really? Try to breathe?
Oh, my God.
Go home.
Just take the kids home, okay? Go home and regroup.
I'll stop by later.
Flynn?
Could you put your seatbelt on, please?
Please. It's not safe.
You're shitting me, right?
If all this is true and you knew about it,
then you're as bad as him.
Whose truck is that?
Dad?
Listen, I need you to come inside and pack right now.
Mom, Aunt Marie,
they said that you were arrested? No, just--
You're some kind of drug dealer?
No, just come inside, please. Now.
Come inside. Come on.
Go, go, go.
Dad, stop. Just talk to me, please. Our priority right now is to pack.
Uncle Hank, they said he arrested you? I will discuss all of this later, okay?
Just tell me what--
Just listen to me!
Go into your bedroom now, grab anything important.
You understand? Go. Now. Both of you. Go.
Walt.
Why are you here?
Skyler, please, will you just go get your things?
For you and the kids. Now. This is our priority.
Hank had you in custody. He wouldn't just let you go.
Where is he? I--
Where's Hank? I...
I negotiated--
Negotiated? Yes.
What does that mean?
It means we're fine, okay?
We are. We're fine. Everything is gonna be fine,
but we need to leave right now.
All right? Can we do that?
What happened?
Where is Hank?
Why do we need to leave?
I need both of you to trust me.
Right now, okay?
Please, just work with me here,
and I promise I will explain everything later, okay?
Where is Hank?
Skyler.
I have $11 million in cash right outside.
We can have a fresh start.
Whole new lives.
All we have to do is go.
We have to go right now.
That's all we have to do.
You killed him.
You killed Hank.
What? No, no, no.
You killed him. Aah! No, no, no!
I tried to save him.
Uncle Hank is dead? I--
Mom, it can't be true. It just can't be true. Just stop, please.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise, but we need to leave right now.
Dad, what's going on? Talk to me.
Just stop for one second.
Look, I told you to get your things.
Stop walking away.
There is no time.
Tell me about Uncle Hank.
No, just drop it!
But what's wrong with you?
We're going. We're going right now.
You have to tell me. Dad, wait.
What happened to Uncle Hank? What--?
Get out.
Skyler, I promise you, we will figure this out.
Enough. Mom,
what are you doing?
Skyler, put the knife down, please.
I promise you, everything-- Don't say one more word.
Get out of here now.
Skyler-- Get out!
Stop it! Just stop! Just stop!
Let go! Let go! Get away from us!
Just stop! Stop!
Dad, stop it! Stop!
Mom, stop it.
Stop, Dad. Stop it now. Stop.
Stop! Just, please, stop!
Stop it! Stop! Stop it!
What the hell is wrong with you?! We're a family!
We're a family.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Yeah, I need the police.
My dad, he pulled a knife on my mom.
He attacked her. He's dangerous.
I think he might have killed somebody.
Yeah.
He's still here.
Yeah, he's still in the house.
We're at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.
308 Negra Arroyo Lane! You've gotta come quick.
Hurry, hurry. Oh, God, no, no!
Oh, my God. No.
Walt, no! Walt! Mom!
Walt, please, no!
No! No! No!
Walt, no! Let her go!
You can't take her!
Let her go, please! You can't take her!
Let her go! Walt!
Walt, please, no!
Walt, no! Walt, please!
Walt, no!
Walt, please, no!
Walt, please!
Please, stop! Walt!
Say, "Da-da."
Da-da. You say, "Da-da"?
There. Get rid of that stinky old diaper, huh?
Don't be sad. Where's your belly button?
Where's your belly button?
There. Now, don't you feel better?
You're all nice and dry. Huh?
That feels good? Oh, I know.
You were so wet and so cranky, but now you feel better, don't you?
Next order of business is to get you a brand-new car seat.
Won't that be nice, Holly?
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
Confirming the abduction.
Amber Alert. Holly White.
Female, 18 months.
Blond hair, blue eyes.
Was last seen wearing a pink and white jacket, pink pants.
Abductor is the father...
He was in handcuffs. Hank had him in handcuffs.
Bald head, goatee, gold, wire-framed glasses.
Are you expecting a call?
<i>Hi, you've reached the White family. Please leave a message.</i>
<i>Skyler, it's me. Pick up. Pick up.</i>
That's him. That's my husband. <i>I need you to pick up the phone.</i>
Start a trace on the landline.
The number's 505-177-8987. <i>I know you're there, so pick it up.</i>
<i>Skyler, you hear me?</i>
Need the location of an incoming caller.
<i>Answer the pho--</i>
Walt, where's Holly?
<i>Are you alone?</i>
<i>No police?</i>
No. No police.
Where are you? Where's Holly?
Walt! <i>What the hell is wrong with you?</i>
<i>Why can't you do one thing I say?</i>
What? <i>This is your fault.</i>
<i>This is what comes of your disrespect.</i>
I told you, Skyler.
I warned you for a solid year.
You cross me, there will be consequences.
What part of that didn't you understand?
You took my child.
<i>Because you need to learn.</i>
You bring her back.
Maybe now you'll listen. Maybe now you'll use your damn head.
You know, you never believed in me.
You were never grateful for anything I did for this family.
<i>"Oh, no. Walt. Walt, you have to stop.</i>
<i>You have to stop this. It's immoral. It's illegal.</i>
<i>Someone might get hurt."</i>
<i>You're always whining and complaining about how I make my money,</i>
<i>just dragging me down, while I do everything.</i>
<i>And now--</i>
Now you tell my son what I do,
<i>after I've told you and told you to keep your damn mouth shut.</i>
You stupid bitch.
<i>How dare you?</i>
I'm sorry.
You have no right
to discuss anything about what I do.
What the hell do you know about it anyway?
<i>Nothing. I built this.</i>
<i>Me. Me alone. Nobody else!</i>
You're right.
You're right.
You mark my words, Skyler.
Toe the line
or you will wind up just like Hank.
Walt.
Tell me what happened.
Where is Hank?
Please.
We need to know.
You're never gonna see Hank again.
<i>He crossed me.</i>
<i>You think about that.</i>
<i>Family or no.</i>
You let that sink in.
<i>Walt.</i>
<i>I just want Holly back.</i>
<i>Please, Walt.</i>
<i>Just come home.</i>
I've still got things left to do.
Hey.
ï»¿1
You can come on out.
It's an actual store. Mm-hm.
I guess I figured "vacuum cleaner repair" was a term of art.
If you would step right here on this blue spot.
Leave your luggage where it is for the moment.
That good?
Sure. What about this?
I'll Photoshop that out.
Oh, Nebraska. What's in Nebraska?
You. From now on.
It's gonna take me some time to get your new situation fixed.
Until then, you're gonna be staying here. I got a place downstairs, out of sight.
It's not the Ritz-Carlton, but it's comfortable enough for short-term.
How short-term?
Considering you got your face up on buses and billboards all over town,
I'm thinking, uh, two days.
Maybe three.
Only thing is,
and I don't like to do this,
but, uh, you'll have a bunk mate.
Oh, yeah? He's still here?
For the moment.
He's a special case. Gonna take some doing.
How's he holding up?
You be the judge.
We will find Hank.
Steve too.
They're out there, and we're gonna find them.
You have my word.
Sir.
Call it in, get her out of here. Move.
<i>I, uh, get to his door,</i>
<i>and I could hear music inside.</i>
<i>Like squeaky voices.</i>
<i>And I thought, you know, maybe, uh...</i>
<i>I knocked on his door.</i>
<i>The music stopped, and then he was right there.</i>
<i>When he saw the gun, he thought...</i>
Hey, Kenny.
Does this pussy cry through the entire thing?
Just watch.
<i>He kept saying that, you know, "You don't have to do this."</i>
<i>His eyes were so big.</i>
<i>They high-fived because it worked.</i> Such a bitch. He won't quit.
<i>Then, you know, we turn around</i>
<i>and there is this kid on a dirt bike</i>
<i>looking at us.</i>
<i>Drew Sharp.</i>
<i>That kid that went missing up in White Horse.</i>
<i>It's him.</i>
<i>And then out of nowhere,</i>
<i>Todd, that Opie, dead-eyed piece of shit,</i>
<i>pulls out a gun and shoots the kid.</i>
<i>This is Todd Alquist we're talking about?</i>
<i>He killed Drew Sharp?</i>
<i>Boom. Like it was nothing.</i>
Hey, Uncle Jack. Hold up.
We should keep him for a while, get a couple of cooks under our belt.
You seriously giving me this turn-the-other-cheek crap?
He ratted you out, personally. We still got 600 gallons of methylamine.
Meth? Who gives a shit about meth? We won the lottery here.
We've got all the money in the world. You're talking to me about selling crank?
I mean, this is millions, Uncle Jack.
No matter how much you got, how do you turn your back on more?
You little...
son of a bitch.
It's that Lydia woman.
You're sweet on her, you little bastard. Ha, ha, ha.
Hey, Kenny, you believe this? Hey, it's all about this right here, huh?
Come on.
You can do better.
That one's so uptight, probably got a wood chipper for a coochie.
Stick it in down there, you're pulling back a stump.
Oh, what the hell?
Heart wants what the heart wants, right?
Let's go back and watch some more of that crybaby rat, huh?
How thick is it?
This is mild steel?
Uh-huh.
No, this would be cash.
What?
Nothing.
Hey, you know what?
Make yourself useful.
Give me a list of hitters, mercenaries.
Yes, yes, I remember. You've got "concerns."
Don't worry. We'll take the time to vet them.
Make sure there are no undercover cops on the team.
Five should do it, providing they're the right men for the job.
I'm gonna hate myself for asking, but who are we hitting?
Jack Welker and his men.
They murdered Hank. They stole my life's work.
I don't know any hit men.
You know a guy who knows a guy.
Just get me the contacts. Anybody in that world.
I'm paying top dollar. We'll find them.
You mind if I give you a nickel's worth of advice?
Just for old time's sake?
You're worried about your wife and kids?
Don't leave.
The way things are now, some people-- Not me, mind you,
but some people might say you're leaving her high and dry.
Some people would be ignorant on the facts.
Some people wouldn't know that as far as the police are concerned,
Skyler is a blameless victim.
No, no, no. Go ahead.
Get it off your chest.
Go on.
The phone call was a smart move. Kudos to you.
Odds are it was recorded. It'll play great for a jury.
It might even buy her a mistrial.
In a year and a half. Until then, if they don't have you, they go after her.
There's no point. She knows nothing. Well, too bad. She's got nothing to trade.
I hate to be a downer here,
but there are two DEA agents missing, presumed dead.
Think the feds will let that go because you hit the ejector seat?
First thing they're gonna do, they will RICO your wife and kids out of the house.
That condo is gone.
Your bank accounts, they're frozen.
Her picture is probably on TV right now, next to yours. Who's gonna hire her?
Money is no problem. Well, I don't mean to contradict you,
but getting it to her, impossible.
The feds are praying that you'll make contact.
The Internet, the phone, it's all tapped.
Hey, Mike was no dummy.
But every time he tried to get his nest egg to his granddaughter,
it ended up in Uncle Sam's pockets.
So you propose what?
Stay. Face the music.
I mean, how much time have you got left? You walk in with your head held high,
be the John Dillinger of the Metropolitan Detention Center. How bad is that?
And you bring a barrel full of drug money.
Maybe that soothes some troubled waters.
Maybe they let your family stay in the house.
After all, the house predates the criminal enterprise.
God, you think I want to run?!
This is the last thing that I want.
This-- This changes nothing.
What I do, I do for my family.
My money goes to my children.
Not just this barrel. All of it!
I'm going to kill Jack and his entire crew,
and I'm gonna take back what is mine and give it to my children.
And then, and only then...
am I through.
Do you understand?
Everything good?
Define "good."
You're set. Time to go.
You'll be a little longer.
I'm still working on transportation.
Change of plans.
He's coming with me.
No. No, that's not-- We're going together. I can use him.
I'll give you two a minute.
Hey, I'm a civilian. I'm not your lawyer anymore.
I'm nobody's lawyer. The fun is over. From here on out, I'm Mr. Low-Profile.
A douche bag with a job and three pairs of Dockers.
If I'm lucky, month from now, best-case scenario,
I'm managing a Cinnabon in Omaha. You're still part of this,
whether you like it or not. Sorry. I don't think so.
You remember what I told you?
It's not over until--
It's over.
Do you want us to cuff her now? Would that make you feel better?
Your client admits to...
Her day of reckoning is now.
-by the time this goes to trial.
Is she even listening?
Mrs. White?
Are you following all this?
Do you understand what's happening here?
Yes.
I understand.
I understand I'm in terrible trouble.
I understand that you will use everything in your power
against me and my children unless--
Unless I give you Walt.
But the truth is, I can't give you what you want.
I don't know where he is.
All right, go and discuss this with your lawyer here.
Rack your brain.
And hope you can come up with something we can use.
<i>Four-seventeen?</i>
Four-seventeen. No activity.
Ma'am, is there anybody else in the house?
What about your son?
If I go look in his room, am I gonna see him?
He's not gonna pop out and surprise me?
If this guy takes his hand away, are you gonna scream?
He's at his friend's house.
He's been there all week.
Please, please, don't hurt my baby.
Please-- Please. Ma'am.
We got a lot of respect for your husband.
There's just something that we gotta straighten out.
Okay, we know that you've been talking to the police,
and that's okay. You gotta do that.
But you've seen some people.
Like that lady who came into the car wash.
The one with the black hair.
You said anything about her?
No.
You sure about that?
I didn't.
The police don't need to know anything about her.
Okay, ma'am, I'm gonna need you to say it.
I will not
say anything about her. Ever.
I swear.
Okay.
When we leave, you're not gonna go running to those police officers out front?
No.
Okay.
Okay.
Because you really don't want us coming back.
Uh-huh. Sure.
Don't. Stay where you are.
We'll talk like this.
Okay.
So that thing that we talked about, I went to Mr. and Mrs. White's house--
You don't have to say the name.
Sure. And it went really good.
I mean, the message was received loud and clear.
The message? Yeah.
Look, I know you did your best. I just think--
Hi. What can I get you?
Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.
And I'll need more stevia. Sure.
The person we're discussing saw my face.
You're not Western Union.
We can't just settle for you sending messages.
Really, if you'd been there, I think you'd see it different.
We threw a real scare into her.
She seems like a nice lady watching out for her kids.
So you're not going to have a problem with her.
I can pretty much guarantee it. I wish I had your certainty,
but I'm not like you and your uncle. I'm just-- I'm not used to this kind of risk.
We're gonna have to take a break.
I have 50 pounds vacuum-packed and ready to go.
And I wish you all the luck in the world with it.
It's 92 percent.
I'm sorry?
Ninety-two percent.
Truly? Tested it twice.
And it's blue, just like before.
Ninety-two. That's Heisenberg level.
He's not with you?
Well, next best thing. Pinkman.
They're looking for Pinkman.
Well, they're not going to find him. He's with us and he's not going anywhere.
Ms. Quayle, this is what your guys in Europe have been begging for, right?
I just think we work together good.
We make a good team.
I think it's kind of
mutually good.
Ninety-two percent.
Unh.
Unh.
Mr. Lambert, welcome to New Hampshire.
All right.
Let's have a look at this place.
You got about a month's worth of food on hand.
Most of it is canned goods, but there's steaks in the freezer.
You got a generator outside, works on LP.
Ought to be enough in the tank to last the winter.
It's only 15 amps, but that ought to do for the lights, the TV and the freezer.
That's a wood-burner.
Ought to warm the place up pretty good.
Plus you can cook on it.
On the TV front, the reception's pretty much nil.
You got some mountains in the way.
Weather is right, you might be able to catch Montreal,
but mostly you'll be limited to DVDs.
<i>Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.</i>
Two copies. Hm.
I'm not much of a movie guy.
I'll make a supply run next month.
You want something else to watch, put it on the list.
Supply run. Heh.
Fifty thousand dollars for a trip to Costco.
It's risk.
And risk is what you're paying me for, not toilet paper.
Risk and a 4400-mile round trip.
Mr. Lambert,
my clients and I don't usually have an ongoing relationship.
Normally you and I would have already gone our separate ways,
but you're you.
Where's the phone? No phone.
Up here, ice storms equal service calls, equal you in cuffs.
Internet? Same deal.
Also satellite, cable TV, drop phone, car.
You want news, I'll bring the Albuquerque papers.
Whatever you need, just put it on the list. Put it on the list. Yeah.
Look, I have business to conduct.
Your business is your business.
My business is keeping you out of custody.
You are the target of a nation-wide manhunt.
Your face is all over TV.
You are the hottest client I have ever had, by far.
It stands to reason you've got to keep out of sight.
And what's keeping me from walking out that gate?
Nothing.
There's a little one-horse town eight miles down the hill.
There's not a thing on God's green earth
that I can do to stop you going down there.
All I'm saying is...
if you leave this place, you will get caught.
And I gotta tell you,
if I find out that you've left the reservation,
I won't be coming back.
That is for my own safety. You understand?
Sure.
Know how to work the stove?
The flue can be tricky. Yeah, I got it.
You paid good money for this.
You got two acres up here, lots of woods, nice, warm place.
Seems to me just the spot for a man to rest up and think on things.
If you look around, it's kind of beautiful.
You've been very helpful. Thank you.
See you in a month.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Oh. Huh.
Come--
Oh, so you're just too good to eat with the rest of us, huh?
It's not for me.
Damn, man, seriously.
That's not my chocolate chip, is it?
You're gonna spoil him.
Hey, you awake?
Uh, yeah.
We had some Ben & Jerry's.
There's peanut butter cup and AmeriCone Dream.
I didn't know what you liked, so I got you some of each.
There you go.
So that batch that you just cooked was 96 percent.
Kind of figured you deserved a little something.
Thanks.
Well, better get some sleep.
Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.
Got a whole new batch.
Hey, Todd. Yeah?
Would you mind leaving the tarp off tonight?
Well, might get cold.
No, I don't mind. I just...
I just wanna see the stars.
Sure. Okay.
Thanks.
Well, good night, Jesse.
Night.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Okay.
Come on, bitch.
Go ahead! Do it!
Just kill me now and get it over with, because there's no way
I'm doing one more cook for you psycho fucks!
Yes? Hi, ma'am. How you doing tonight?
You're Andrea, right?
How can I help you?
You know Jesse Pinkman?
Right? Well, I'm a friend of his. My name's Todd.
I'm sorry to bother you so late, but it's nice to meet you.
How is Jesse? Is he okay?
Yeah, he's okay.
Actually, I brought him with me.
Jesse's here?
Yeah, he's right over there in that truck.
Where?
No!
Just so you know, this isn't personal.
No!
Whoa, hey, settle down.
Settle down.
Hey, remember.
There's still the kid.
I brought you a couple of cases of Ensure. Maybe put a little weight on you.
Jesus.
I can barely read this.
Ah. Almost forgot.
Without a prescription, I had to take an educated guess and shotgun it.
One of these ought to come close. Oh.
Did you check on them?
Is Skyler in a better place?
No, she's still at that place off of Eubank.
Kids are both still with her for the moment.
There's no court date yet.
The news was talking about a grand jury, but they didn't say when.
I saw her public defender on TV.
Looks like a deer in the headlights.
Think I got socks older than him.
What are they doing for money?
She's doing taxi dispatch, part-time.
Leaves the baby with a neighbor when she goes in.
I saw her shopping one time.
She looks pretty good.
And she's using her maiden name.
I wouldn't take that personally, under the circumstances.
Those working for you?
Yeah, yeah.
I took a run by your old house.
The auction's still pending.
They put a fence up around it.
They put up a fence?
Seems like the place got to be kind of a tourist attraction. Kids breaking in.
The neighbors complained, so the bank put up a fence.
You ready? Hm?
Yeah.
Sorry about last time.
It should go better now. I watched a couple of YouTube videos.
It's all about finding the vein.
Give it to me. I'll do it.
Here, you do it.
Make a fist. Tight. There we go.
All right, it's just...
Stick.
That's it. Okay. Hey.
Pretty good. There you go.
Think I had worse my last physical.
I will see you on...
Let's see.
Afternoon of the 15th.
Stay a little longer?
Yeah, I got a long trip ahead of me.
Two hours?
I'll give you another $10,000.
Please.
Ten thousand.
One hour.
Cards?
All right, well...
The game will be seven-card.
I'll deal, since you are encumbered.
One of these days, when you come up here,
I'll be dead.
My money over there.
What happens to it then?
What if I ask you to give it to my family?
Would you do it?
If I said yes...
would you believe me?
You wanna cut the cards?
No.
A king.
Two kings.
<i>Flynn White to the principal's office, please.</i>
I'm sorry to pull you out of class.
It's your aunt Marie.
It sounds very important.
You can take it in here, okay? Okay.
Here he is.
Thank you.
Hey, Aunt Marie.
What's--? What's going on?
Hold on a sec, honey.
<i>Look at those numbers for Denver.</i>
<i>Things haven't gone their way.</i>
Son, it's me. Please, don't let on.
<i>Carmen is nearby, right? She cannot know.</i>
<i>Son, are you there?</i>
Yes.
It's so good to hear your voice.
I, uh...
Son, the things that they're saying
<i>about me.</i>
<i>I did wrong. I made some terrible mistakes.</i>
But the reasons were always...
Things happened that I never intended.
I never intended--
Listen, son, we don't have much time.
Is Louis' family still at 4848 Newcombe?
<i>Son, your friend, Louis Corbett,</i>
<i>does his family still live in that same place up on Newcombe?</i>
Yes. <i>Okay, good.</i>
Okay, he's a good kid. He's like you. He'll understand.
<i>I'm sending Louis a package.</i>
<i>Now, it's addressed to Louis, but it's for you,</i>
<i>your mother and your sister.</i>
There's money inside.
About $100,000. Okay?
I think.
<i>It was all that I could fit into the box.</i>
<i>It has to be a secret.</i>
If anyone says a word, the police will take it.
<i>I wanted to give you so much more.</i>
<i>But this is all I could do.</i>
Do you understand?
Son?
Can you hear me? Do you understand?
You want to send money?
Yes. Good.
Good, good.
So you'll talk to Louis, right?
You killed Uncle Hank.
You killed him! Listen. Wait. Wait, son.
No. What you did to Mom-- You asshole. <i>Please--</i>
You killed Uncle Hank.
Listen to me. You've got to listen to me. Just shut up. Just stop it. Stop it.
<i>I don't want anything from you.</i>
I don't give a shit.
You need this money. <i>You killed Uncle Hank.</i>
<i>You killed him!</i> Your mother needs this money.
It can't all be for nothing. <i>What you did--</i>
Please. Please. <i>Just shut up. Shut up.</i>
<i>Will you just--? Just leave us alone.</i>
You asshole!
Why are you still alive?
<i>Why won't you just die already?</i> Please--
Just-- Just die.
<i>Wagner hasn't had to be really stellar tonight.</i>
<i>Made solid saves back in the first period.</i>
<i>You know, Michael, that's probably-- Going back, look at Wagner's numbers,</i>
<i>you know, it seems like he's one of the last goalies in the league.</i>
<i>They don't wanna put pressure on this guy.</i>
<i>Kevin Granato looks to make a move, had the puck taken.</i>
<i>Denver comes back out the other way.</i>
<i>--by Graham Melanson off Rycroft. Who else?</i>
<i>Boy, he's been all over the ice tonight.</i>
<i>DEA, Albuquerque District Office.</i>
<i>How may I direct your call?</i>
I'd like to speak to the agent
in charge of the Walter White investigation.
<i>Who may I say is calling?</i>
Walter White.
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>
<i>Sir? Sir, are you still there?</i>
<i>--this is notjust a goalie that's out there, it's a whole team.</i>
<i>Two forty-nine remaining in the third period.</i>
You ready for that drink now?
Dimple Pinch. Neat.
You got it.
<i>--and Melanson, with a good look, makes the save.</i>
<i>That's why you need good, solid breakout passes.</i>
<i>Matt Peterson-- Win the draw, Englehart wins the draw, back to Peterson,</i>
<i>goes behind the net, makes a terrible breakout pass, goes right to Hackard.</i>
<i>He just winds up, puts it on net here. Turnovers, turnovers.</i>
<i>When you get turnovers in the offensive zone, chances happen.</i>
<i>Hopefully it won't happen again.</i>
<i>Turnovers generally--</i>
<i>- I wasn't sure you'd come.
I'm not staying--</i>
<i>- Is this transfer good on the--?
Darker than a normal rosÃ©--</i>
<i>For us, it's always been science first, and--</i>
Wait, would you--? Would you--?
Would you go back, please?
<i>- ShamWows--
More of a by-product.</i>
There. <i>Exactly.</i>
What, this? Yes.
<i>Butjust yesterday, your charity,</i>
<i>the Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz Foundation,</i>
<i>announced a $28 million grant</i>
<i>for drug-abuse treatment centers throughout the Southwest.</i>
<i>Charlie, the Southwest is our home</i>
<i>and we couldn't just ignore what's going on in our own backyard.</i>
<i>But I'm sure you're aware that there are people who suggest other motives.</i>
<i>Andrew Ross Sorkin of</i> The New York Times
<i>wrote a column suggesting</i>
<i>that the grant was a kind of publicity maneuver</i>
<i>to shore up the stock price of Gray Matter Technologies</i>
<i>because of your association with Walter White.</i>
<i>That's not exactly the way--</i>
<i>To cleanse yourselves, so to speak,</i>
<i>of having a methamphetamine kingpin as cofounder of your company.</i>
<i>Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up.</i>
<i>I have to believe that the investing public understands</i>
<i>we're talking about a person who was there early on,</i>
<i>but who had nothing to do with the creation of the company</i>
<i>and still less to do with growing it.</i>
<i>So, what was Walter White's contribution?</i>
<i>You know, to be honest... Honey?</i>
<i>The company name. The company name.</i>
<i>We came up with it by combining our names.</i>
<i>"Schwartz" means "black."</i>
<i>Black plus white makes gray. Hence Gray Matter Technologies.</i>
<i>Exactly. As far as I can recall, his contribution begins and ends there.</i>
<i>There are continuing reports of blue methamphetamine,</i>
<i>considered his signature product, throughout the Southwest</i>
<i>and some evidence of reaching as far as Europe.</i>
<i>So my question is, is Walter White still out there?</i>
<i>No, he's not.</i>
<i>You sound very sure.</i>
<i>I am.</i>
<i>I can't speak to this Heisenberg that people refer to,</i>
<i>but whatever he became,</i>
<i>the sweet, kind, brilliant man</i>
<i>that we once knew long ago, he's gone.</i>
<i>But to be absolutely clear...</i>
Police! Hands! Show us your hands. Show us your hands.
What's going on?
Let's see your hands!
ï»¿1
Just get me home.
Just get me home.
I'll do the rest.
Yes, hello, this is David Linn from <i>The New York Times.</i>
May I speak with Susan, please? Thank you.
Hi, Susan, it's David again.
I was just calling to see if we can set--
Well, yes. Well, I figured we'd have to do the interview by phone,
since they've already left New York.
But what we'd really love to get is a photo of Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz
to go along with the article.
When are they scheduled to get home?
Oh, so they'll be home tonight. Gotcha.
Now, the address I have on them is Upper Canyon Road. Is that still...?
No, it isn't. They've-- Oh, let me get a pen.
Where do they...?
Tesuque. I see.
And the address?
Is that up near the opera house? I hear that's nice.
Well, I'll be in contact with my photographer
to check on his schedule.
No, no, it's their call.
I know how busy Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz are.
Thank you.
This should make one hell of a story.
Goodbye.
<i>I'm just saying, it's apples and oranges.</i>
Listen, I maintain,
if I want pizza,
I go to a pizza place. Yeah.
If I want Thai, I go to a Thai place.
What is the point in comparing Did I marry you?
pizza to Thai? What has happened?
This is different.
They're completely--
Oh, come on, are you the man I married?
I am the guy who wants to end this ridiculous conversation,
kick off my shoes, and have a very large glass of wine.
Well, I'm gonna tell you to be my guest.
All right, wait.
The answer is 21.
No. Yes.
Yes, because it has history.
Come on.
Prohibition.
The <i>Sweet Smell of Success.</i>
And Per Se has Thomas Keller.
Game, set, and match.
The whole vibe is so Yountville.
You transplant it to Manhattan--
Transplant it to Islamabad, I would eat there.
Oh, there's a good thought.
What, Islamabad?
No, Napa. We have to go to Napa.
Oh, my God, all this talk of food. Do you think Juana left us anything?
She doesn't think we're coming back until Wednesday.
Unless you told her. No, I haven't talked to her.
Oh, look, here.
Just a pear, that'll be perfect. Yeah.
You wanna get us a nice bottle of wine?
Mm-hm.
Do you think we have any of those--?
What are those crackers with, like, the sun-dried tomato,
and they were slightly peppery, but not too peppery.
We don't have them?
No.
Ask Juana.
We haven't had them in forever.
I don't know why she doesn't get those. Why don't you talk to her?
She's got that thing with her daughter.
Anyway, Napa? Yeah.
How long since we've been? Two years.
Jesus, that's two years.
Yeah, too long, right? Is this okay?
Oh, that looks <i>p e r fe c to.</i>
You wanna get the fireplace?
Is it good? Mm-hm.
Is it ripe? Mm-hm.
Yeah.
We could invite George and Delores. They could come up from Marin.
And Bill and Miriam Cohen.
We could have a little spa action, right?
And then we could do some sort of wine, and then--
Hello, Gretchen.
Elliott.
I really like your new house.
Walt.
This...
Are we looking east?
Oh...
My God, you must have one great view of the Sangre de Cristos.
Walt,
what are you doing here?
I saw you on <i>Charlie Rose.</i>
You looked great.
You both did. If you are here to--
To hurt us--
Walt, whatever it is you're planning--
Actually, I'm here to give you something.
It's out in my car.
How about the three of us take a walk to it? It's just parked down the road.
I couldn't get it past your gate.
Elliott, if we're gonna go that way,
you'll need a bigger knife.
Keep stacking. It'll all fit.
That's all right.
Yeah, just throw it on top.
Gretchen, would you mind? We don't want to lose any under the furniture.
All right.
That is $9,720,000.
Where did it come from? And why is it here?
I earned it, and you're going to give it to my children.
What? Why? Walt, I don't think we--
On my son's 18th birthday,
which is 10 months and two days from today,
you will give him this money,
in the form of an irrevocable trust.
You will tell him that it is his to do with as he sees fit,
but with the hope that he uses it for his college education.
And for the betterment of his family. Walt, I'm not sure that we follow.
Why...?
I mean, why, in particular, would we--?
If you wanna give your kids drug money, go do it yourself.
I can't.
My wife and son hate me.
They won't take my money.
Even if they did,
the federal government wouldn't let them.
But two rich benefactors who are known for their charitable endeavors,
who would think nothing of, for instance, writing a $28 million check,
to help victims of methamphetamine abuse?
I have to think that your money would be very welcome.
It wouldn't make any sense coming from us.
It certainly would.
My children are blameless victims of their monstrous father.
A man who you once knew quite well.
Call it a beau geste, call it liberal guilt,
call it whatever you want, but do it.
And you are not to spend a single dime of your own money.
If there are taxes or lawyers' fees owed, you will take it right from here.
They use my money, never yours.
Okay, Walt, sure.
That sounds reasonable.
So, what happens next?
I guess we shake on it, and I leave.
I can trust you to do this.
Yes.
Absolutely, you can.
Don't move. Don't-- Don't dare move a muscle.
You don't want them to think that you're trying to get away. Just breathe.
Just this afternoon, I had an extra $200,000
that I would have loved dearly to leave on top of this table.
Instead, I gave it to the two best hit men west of the Mississippi.
Now,
whatever happens to me tomorrow,
they'll still be out there.
Keeping tabs.
And if,
for any reason,
that my children do not get this money,
a kind of countdown will begin.
Maybe a day or so later, maybe a week, a year,
when you're going for a walk in Santa Fe or Manhattan or Prague, wherever,
and you're talking about your stock prices
without a worry in the world.
And then suddenly,
you'll hear the scrape of a footstep behind you,
but before you can even turn around:
Pop!
Darkness.
Cheer up, beautiful people.
This is where you get to make it right.
Oh, yeah, right.
You know, I don't exactly know how to feel about all this.
For real, yo.
Whole thing felt kind of shady, you know, like, morality-wise?
Totally.
How do you feel now?
Better. Yeah, definitely improving.
What's this I hear
about blue meth still being out there?
What do you mean?
Have you heard anything?
Is it still being sold?
Yeah.
By whom?
It's you, right?
I mean, aren't you still cooking?
Damn, man.
We were sure it was you,
because that shit is choice, yo.
Better than ever.
I mean, um, you know.
Jesse. Seriously?
You said he moved to Alaska. That's what I heard.
Right on, Jesse.
Passing the torch.
Damn, man, couldn't he at least throw a brother a bone?
Whoa, what happened there?
It's my birthday.
Yeah? Well, happy birthday.
It's easy money. Till we catch you. Say the word, I'll take you on a ride-along.
You can watch us knock down a meth lab.
Get a little excitement in your life. Heh, heh.
Yeah, someday.
Welcome. Would you like a menu? No, thank you.
Chamomile tea with soy milk, please. All right, you got it.
Hey, how you doing?
Good.
How's things?
Hey, I like your...
Shirt.
My blouse? Nice. Yeah, I like the color.
That's a nice color on you.
It's kind of a--
I don't know exactly what you'd call it. It's kind of a cornflower blue.
Before you say or do anything, just hear me out.
Todd. Nobody knows that I'm here.
Just listen for two minutes, and then I'll leave. Please.
No. Please.
Just two minutes of your time. That's all I ask.
Please.
You're running out of methylamine, aren't you?
I can do the math.
You've been at it long enough. You must be running low.
I have a new method
that requires no methylamine.
It's easy, and it will keep you in business. And, Todd, I could teach it to you.
How did you know to find us here?
Ten a.m.
Every Tuesday morning, you and I met here.
You're rather schedule-oriented, I guess.
Sorry.
I need the money.
I've spent almost all of mine already,
just trying to stay one step ahead of the police.
Mr. White, I don't think there's--
How much would it cost us?
Nothing short of a million.
And believe me, for this,
that is giving it away.
I think Jack should hear this.
Yeah, I don't know.
Now, listen, I can come up there tonight and talk to him.
He'd get it.
This is a win-win situation.
Hi, what can I get for you two? He's just leaving.
Good seeing you again. Take care.
For you?
I'm good.
And I need more stevia.
Okay, no disrespect to the man, but doing business with him?
Right now, that's not--
Of course we're not doing business with him.
Todd, please.
Don't make me walk you through this.
Jesus. Did you look at him?
You'd be doing him a favor.
<i>Hello, please record after the tone.</i>
<i>Truce, all right?</i>
<i>Skyler, I have news about Walt, and you need to hear it,</i>
<i>so if you're there, pick up.</i>
<i>Skyler--</i>
Hey.
What's up?
<i>Walt's in town.</i>
Yeah?
That car they thought he stole in New Hampshire,
they found it in a Denny's parking lot right on Central.
<i>And your next-door neighbor, on the right-- What's her name, Becky?</i>
Becky's on the left. Carol's on the right. <i>Becky, Carol, whatever.</i>
<i>She saw him at your old house.</i>
Just this morning, plain as day.
He's there, walking out of your house, and he calls her by name.
He didn't hurt her, did he? He didn't--? No, he's just like, "Hey, Becky!"
Or Carol, whatever.
<i>She said he looked exactly like the Unabomber.</i>
But she's positive it was him. They're getting calls from all over town.
He's here, he's there, he's going to blow up city hall.
He has some sort of manifesto. He wants to be on the news.
Who's making these calls? Him? <i>There are two or three voices.</i>
<i>They're not sure if they're crank calls or people he's put up to it,</i>
<i>or if they're actual anonymous tips.</i>
<i>It's stretching them thin, which is maybe the point.</i>
<i>As far as I'm concerned,</i>
there are three places that he would go: To you, to me, or Flynn.
<i>Right.</i>
They're watching the high school.
They're probably watching your place too.
I mean,
I know that's what Hank would do.
There is no way Walt's getting to you. They are absolutely going to catch him.
No doubt about it.
That arrogant asshole thinks he's some criminal mastermind, but he's not.
<i>But on the off chance...</i>
Yeah.
On the million-to-one chance,
you be on the lookout, okay?
Thanks.
You got it.
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
You didn't kill anybody sneaking in here, did you?
You didn't hurt anybody? No.
Didn't have to.
You look terrible.
Yeah.
But I feel good.
So talk.
Why are you here?
It's over.
And I needed a proper goodbye.
Not our last phone call.
So you're going to the police?
They'll be coming to me.
If you're in custody,
what stops those people from coming back?
When--
When I still had the house,
three men came in the middle of the night,
wearing masks, threatening Holly and Flynn and me.
They told me not to talk about that woman at the car wash,
and if you're in custody--
They're not coming back. Not after tonight.
What's tonight?
We don't want your money, Walt.
I thought Flynn made that clear.
He did.
And I don't have any to give you.
I spent the last of it getting here.
All I have to give you
is this.
Call the DEA once I leave.
Tell them I was here. That I forced my way in.
Tell them...
Tell them I wanted bacon and eggs on my birthday,
and that I gave you that ticket.
Those numbers are GPS coordinates.
For what?
A burial site.
That's where they'll find Hank and Steve Gomez.
It's where I buried our money.
And the men who stole it from us,
the men who still have it,
they murdered Hank and Steve
and put them in that hole.
Now, you trade that
for a deal with the prosecutor.
You get yourself out of this.
Skyler.
Skyler.
All the things that I did,
you need to understand-- If I have to hear
one more time
that you did this for the family--
I did it for me.
I liked it.
I was good at it.
And
I was
really...
I was alive.
Flynn will be home soon.
Before I go,
may I see her?
Whoo.
Damn, man, this thing's a classic.
What block you got in it?
The 500 or the 425?
Couldn't tell you.
Well...
Five hundred.
That's the one you want.
No replacement for displacement.
Where to?
To the clubhouse.
Go ahead, just park it right in front over here.
No, no, no, just straight in, man. Just-- What are--?
All right, fine, here, whatever.
Hey, how you doing?
Turn around, put your arms out like this.
While you're at it, why don't you lift your shirt up,
give us a spin?
Christ, I'm not wearing a wire.
Okay?
My wallet and keys? Yeah, you'll get them back. Just relax.
Stay here.
Keep your eyes open.
Jesus, look at you with that head of hair. Is that real?
Yes.
That's not a wig? Seriously? No.
What were you doing before, shaving it?
Yes.
Christ, that is one fine head of hair.
I mean, otherwise, you look like shit, but--
Hello to you too, Jack. Now, can we talk business?
I don't think so, no.
Did Todd tell you what I'm offering? Yeah, he told me.
The thing is we're not really in the market.
You're low on methylamine. What happens then?
No, we'll get more.
That Quayle woman's got her own setup. The heat's off her.
She can break loose a barrel. It ain't broke, so why fix it?
Todd, please, would you explain things to your uncle?
Explain to him the benefit of what I'm offering.
You really shouldn't have come back, Mr. White.
I'm sorry.
Wait. Jack. Where do you want it?
I don't know, anywhere but my living room?
Take him out back. Jack, look, you owe me.
You owe me. Hey, hey, hey.
Let's go. I owe you, what for?
Jesse Pinkman. You promised you would kill him, and you didn't.
Instead, you partnered with him. All right.
You're his partner now-- Whoa, stop.
Partners? What are you talking about?
He's alive, isn't he?
He's cooking for you.
What, are you gonna lie?
Him being alive is not him and me being partners.
Not by a damn sight.
What, you think I'd partner with a rat?
Where is that little piece of shit?
He's finishing up a batch.
Go get him. Bring him here.
Uncle Jack-- No. No, no, no.
This one here, calling me a liar?
He just insulted you, he insulted me, all of us.
Jesus. Hustle it up. Come on. Let's get this over with.
I'm gonna show you just how wrong you are.
Then I'm putting that bullet in your head myself.
Yeah, you see what I'm talking about, you son of a bitch?
Now, does this look like a partner to you?
Come here. Take a look.
Come here!
Take a look at him.
Have a gander.
This is my partner.
Right, partner? Right, buddy?
Hardworking, good partner. Fifty-fifty partner.
Can you hurry this shit up?
Make it quick?
Toddy, get him off, would you? Yeah, Toddy, get them both off.
Uncle Jack.
Jesus.
Mr. White.
Wait. Wait.
You want your money, right?
You wanna know where it is?
You pull that trigger, you'll never--
Do it.
You want this.
Say the words.
Say you want this!
Nothing happens until I hear you say it.
I want this.
Then do it yourself.
Pick up the phone.
<i>Hello?</i>
Is it done?
Is he gone?
<i>Yeah, it's done.</i>
<i>He's gone.</i>
<i>They're all gone.</i>
Todd? Who is this?
It's Walt.
How are you feeling?
Kind of under the weather?
Like you've got the flu?
That would be the ricin I gave you.
<i>I slipped it into that stevia crap that you're always putting in your tea.</i>
Oh, my God.
Well,
goodbye, Lydia.
