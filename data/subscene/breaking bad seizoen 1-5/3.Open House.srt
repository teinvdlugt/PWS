3
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,997
Son of a...

4
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,257
I'm not leaving.

5
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,847
Walt, I'm not leaving.

6
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,391
Oh, my God.

7
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,696
Ah. l can hear
your cell phone ringing!

8
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,492
This is ridiculous. I can't...

9
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:48,960
Ah. Uh--
What is going on with you?
I've left you, like, 23 messages.

10
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,255
And?
And?

11
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,341
We need to talk
about the car wash.

12
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,094
Skyler, now is not a good time
for me, okay?

13
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,013
Can we talk about this later?
No, okay? We can't.

14
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,560
Why are you doing--?

15
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,020
Oh, Jesus.

16
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,190
What happened?
Nothing. l just bumped it. That's all.

17
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,026
Okay, I'm-- I'm coming in.

18
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,326
Okay.

19
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,371
Exactly what happened?

20
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:29,000
It's complicated
and I don't wish to discuss it.

21
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,211
It's none of your concern.
Are you in danger?

22
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,839
Walt.

23
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:40,595
Walt, I need you
to look me in the eye
and tell me right now.

24
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,139
Are you in danger?
You know what?

25
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:50,104
Let's just say that l have a hell
of a lot more on my mind right now

26
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:53,232
than thinking about buying
a damn car wash.

27
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,525
Okay?

28
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,694
So if you could just--

29
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,779
Please.

30
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,742
Okay.

31
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,996
Okay. Then we go to the police.

32
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,875
What?
We tell them everything.

33
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,793
That you're a drug dealer

34
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,922
afraid for your safety
and the safety of your family

35
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,174
and you need help.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,217
What choice is there?
What choice?

37
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,720
If you're in danger,
then it would be--

38
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,181
Wait, wait, stop, stop. Stop.

39
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,975
You keep saying that word.
"Danger." "Danger."

40
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,811
But you said--
No, I have never used that word.

41
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,940
I said "complicated,"
and then you flew off the handle.

42
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,193
Yeah, I flew off the handle
when l saw that.

43
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,154
Okay?
Where'd that come from? Hm?

44
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,115
A fall in the shower?
Uh--

45
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,161
This is just so passive-aggressive,
you know.

46
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,454
Passive-aggressive?

47
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,249
I go two days without returning
your phone calls, two days,

48
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,754
and I have one minor little incident,
and now you're telling me

49
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,590
that I should turn myself
in to the police!

50
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,008
A minor incident?
Yes.

51
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,095
What minor little incident?

52
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:10,267
I had an argument
with a co-worker, okay?

53
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,020
And?

54
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,939
I had an argument.

55
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,024
We were in this bar

56
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,361
and we were discussing
a particular business strategy.

57
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:26,575
And it got heated and out of control,
and he hit me. Once.

58
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,912
And I didn't retaliate
because he's a much older man.

59
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,289
And that's it.

60
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,294
You were in a bar fight?

61
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:45,136
Yes, Skyler. I was in a bar fight.

62
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,764
So you're okay?

63
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,309
Really?

64
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,481
Yes.

65
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,442
I'm okay.

66
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,405
And I think, in the end,
that it may have been a good thing

67
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,742
because we were able
to clear the air and,
you know--

68
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,952
Mutual respect, and...

69
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,455
So...

70
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,499
Frozen peas.

71
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,421
What?
It's the best thing for the swelling.

72
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:24,133
Oh, it's not really swollen,
it's just--

73
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,177
No peas.

74
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,345
You don't even have ice.

75
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,683
I will get peas, I will get ice.
Peas and ice, I'm writing it down.

76
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,853
I, um...

77
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,400
I need you to promise me

78
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,154
that if things do get dangerous--

79
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,907
Skyler--
Promise me.

80
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,326
Absolutely.

81
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,246
So...

82
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,625

Whole lot of natural light.

Michael Kilbourne.

100
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,014
Tori Costner.
It's nice to meet you.

101
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:58,018
Well, three bedrooms, one and a half
baths on just under half an acre.

102
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,980
There's a non-attached casita
out in back.

103
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,108
Permit usable as office
or guest suite.

104
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,318
Hm.
Plank wood floors.

105
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,945
Central heat and air.

106
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,239
I see you're married.

107
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,074
No, divorced.

108
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,576
Very recent.

109
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,703
Old habits. Heh.
Oh, I'm sorry.

110
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,331
But any children?
Yes, as a matter of fact. A little boy.

111
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, how old?

112
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,378
He turned 4 in May. He's a Gemini.
Would love this yard.

113
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,589
Oh, plenty of space for a jungle gym.

114
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,550
And the neighborhood preschool
is fantastic.

115
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,094
I think Eli is going to be
homeschooled.

116
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,471
Oh, well, great.
Not for religious reasons.

117
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,057
I wanna make sure
he's getting attention.

118
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,144
He'll still go to summer camp
and whatnot, playdates.

119
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,606
Don't want him to be socially awkward.
Oh, no. Makes sense.

120
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,775
He tests very highly,
96 percentile.

121
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,071
But that whole right brain, left brain.
You want those in balance.

122
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,364
Oh, yeah.

123
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:57,244
You said the casita has plumbing?

124
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:01,415
I work a lot with clay,
so I need access to running water.

125
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,585
Well, it's pipe-fitted
for a quarter bath so...

126
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,171
Make a perfect studio.

127
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,256
Hm.

128
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,468
This could work.

129
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,764
Heh, heh. Hell,
that's the doctor's plan
to get her patients at ease.

130
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,099
If you know what l mean.

131
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,601
But, nurse--

132
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,728
Hello? l'm back.

133
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,438
That's okay.

134
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,149
- Hank?
- Yeah.

135
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,452
I had to go to three places
to get the moisturizer that you like.

136
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,912
But l got that.

137
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,166
And I got your Shiner Bock
and your chips.

138
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,503
And I couldn't resist.

139
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,716
The complete encyclopedia
to fantasy football.

140
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:57,763
Look, it has all the latest rankings.
Marie, I said Cheetos, not Fritos.

141
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,057
Wait, I...

142
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,560
I said Cheetos, like, 1 0 times.
You need me to write it down?

143
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,605
No, and I don't need you
to be mean about it either.

144
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,776
Well, I'm just saying,
you know, I said Cheetos.
"Ch," "ch," "ch" sound.

145
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:15,155
Virtually impossible to confuse
Cheetos with Fritos, seems to me.

146
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,451
Where are you going?
I-- Back to the store, I guess.

147
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,121
Here.

148
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,291
And the draft's not for two months,
so this is useless.

149
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,098
Can you believe it?

150
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,685
What?

151
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,271
What? This.

152
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,737
Well, you always said this place
could be bugged.

153
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,947
Now we know.
Yeah, well.

154
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,199
I don't like it.

155
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,910
It's a violation of the work space.

156
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,621
Yeah, I guess.

157
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,167
You wanna do something?

158
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,003
Do something?

159
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,880
Like what?

160
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,383
Go-karts?

161
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,387
Go-karts. What--?

162
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:25,768
Yeah, there's a track
down by the Coliseum.

163
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,978
It's pretty fun.

164
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:38,530
No, actually l have
some kind of a meeting, so...

165
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,115
All right, whatever.

166
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,913
Rain check?

167
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,540
Yeah. Sure.

168
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,131
How you doing?

169
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,302
Good.
Yeah?

170
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,597
You okay?

171
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,686
Is there, uh,
anything we should talk about?

172
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,318
How's your eye?

173
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,156
Yeah, it's fine.

174
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:25,536
Anything we should talk about?

175
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,753
For what it's worth,

176
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,923
getting the shit kicked
out of you...

177
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,511
not to say you get used to it...

178
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,515
but you do kind of get used to it.

179
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,905
Two words: nail salon.

180
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,241
Perfect for money laundering.

181
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,494
It's a high-volume business
with a discreet work force.

182
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,372
I mean, nobody does,
"Mister, me know nothing"

183
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,041
better than Mrs. Mookjaiaporn
and her gals.

184
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,710
Mr. Goodman--

185
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:15,961
"Saul," please.

186
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,338
Now, for the lady
of the house.

187
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,799
Drum roll.
How about a lifetime supply

188
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,260
of French manicures
and enzyme peels?

189
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,596
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Pinch yourself. Ha-ha-ha.

190
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,016
We're not buying a nail salon,
Mr. Goodman.

191
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,351
We're getting the car wash.
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,813
Am l missing something here?
Didn't you already try that?

193
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:39,485
Yeah. I mean, Walt told me that you
took a run at this Bogdan character

194
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,738
and he wrestled you into
submission with his eyebrows.

195
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,866
Ten million,
that was the asking price, right?

196
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,952
Apparently,
he upped it to 20.

197
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:53,123
Wow. Nice negotiating. Yeah, l mean,
hey, you bombed. It happens.

198
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,627
You were smart to call me. Now--

199
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,172
You just sit back, relax,
and let a professional take over.

200
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,468
That's for me. Excuse me.

201
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,641
What do you want?
I'm in a meeting.

202
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,810
Why didn't you think of that before?
It's not my--

203
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,104
I'm in a meeting.

204
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,400
Can Huell use your bathroom?

205
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,237
Huell?

206
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,865
Uh, sure.
The top of the stairs.

207
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,992
He'll be quick.

208
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,622
It's a stomach thing. It's...

209
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,749
So where were we?

210
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,752
Professionalism.
Yeah.

211
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,421
So if the guy won't sell,
he won't sell.

212
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,591
I don't accept that.
I don't accept that he won't sell.

213
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,928
I think he just lacks
the proper...

214
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,304
motivation.

215
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,974
Motivation. Ah.

216
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:58,564
As in "motivation" motivation? l mean,
just so we're on the same page here,

217
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,733
are you saying we make him an offer
he can't refuse?

218
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,361
Nothing so dramatic as that, no.

219
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,405
Motivation.

220
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,701
Attitude adjustment.

221
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,540
This one, she's a keeper.

222
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,959
Well, an audit can be
highly motivating.

223
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,003
I know a gal
at Tax and Revenue.

224
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,590
You give her 1 0 minutes,
she'll have his sky raining frogs.

225
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,552
No, we don't want to draw
any unwanted tax attention.

226
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,972
We don't want them looking at us
after Bogdan sells.

227
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,891
All right, how about an lCE raid?

228
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,728
He's got illegals working
over there. He has to.

229
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,648
We are not getting a bunch
of poor, innocent people
in trouble, no.

230
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:45,444
Yeah, and also
you're gonna need them
after you take over.

231
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,031
Hey, how about terrorism?

232
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,242
"Oh, Agent Hoover, l gotta tell you,

233
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,622
I've seen some real 'Islamic' comings
and goings over there at the car wash.

234
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,667
Yeah, I mean, guys in turbans
pulling up in vans and stuff
like that." Ha, ha.

235
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:04,379
Saul, Bogdan is Romanian.

236
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,842
Okay, well,
we're just spitballing here, so...

237
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,928
Okay, there's always:

238
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,432
"You got
a real nice place here.

239
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,227
Be a shame if something
happened to it." That angle.

240
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,397
What are you talking about?

241
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,983
Violence?

242
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,028
Attitude adjustment.

243
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,321
Oh, no. That, no.

244
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,783
That is not at all what I meant.
I-- We do not do that.

245
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,494
That's not who we are, right?

246
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,414
Yeah, no, no, no. She's right.

247
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,709
Look, do I need to state
the obvious?

248
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:47,047
I mean, there's gotta be dozens
of car washes in this area.

249
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,800
Who says it has to be this one?

250
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,885
I do.

251
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,970
I say it has to.

252
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,722
Why?

253
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,975
I just do.

254
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,937
God.

255
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,147
Well, that clears things up.

256
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,734
I don't like him. Bogdan.
Oh.

257
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:12,406
He was condescending
to me, rude about you,
and I do not like him.

258
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,408
Simple as that.

259
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:20,122
Hey, nobody appreciates
a passionate woman more than I do.

260
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,124
But in this business--

261
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,459
And Walt can back me up on this.

262
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,879
--the number one rule
is don't take things personally.

263
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,550
What do you mean, rude about me?

264
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,726
Something along the lines
of you weren't man enough

265
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,936
to face him yourself.

266
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,732
What?
That you had to send your woman

267
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,526
to do your business for you.
Ha, ha.

268
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:54,823
Speaking as your lawyer, I'm gonna go
on record and say this is a bad idea.

269
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,993
Now, I advise against--
It's this one. lt's this one.

270
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,335
Okay, so, uh...

271
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:13,759
All we have to do is think
of a non-violent, unsuspicious way

272
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,387
to purchase the car wash,
that protects the innocents

273
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:21,057
and doesn't cost $20 million.

274
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,480
Don't everybody speak
at once.

275
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,861
- I like it.
Mm-hm.

276
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,488
Yeah.

277
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,580
Hi.

278
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,624
Can l answer any questions?

279
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,711
Oh. Spoons.
Yes, the owner is quite the collector.

280
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,798
Aren't they something?
One for each of the 50 states.

281
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,719
Puerto Rico is technically a territory.
Huh.

282
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,348
You know, maybe they
were thinking, "Someday."

283
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,311
So no basement?

284
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,105
No basement. Sorry.
That's a problem.

285
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,859
My brother's in the Peace Corps
and won't be back for 1 8 months

286
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,362
and I said I'd hang on
to his furniture.

287
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,241
Well, if you're looking
for storage space,
there's an attic area.

288
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,537
Oh. Well, an attic might be
even better, as long as it's dry.

289
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,288
Let's take a tour.
Okay.

290
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,500
Actually, I have a handout for you.

291
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,465
It has all the information.

292
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,718
I'm Stephanie Doswell, by the way.
Charlotte Blattner.

293
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,555
So nice to meet you, Charlotte.
You too.

294
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,223
So I told him point-blank.

295
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:47,853
You're my husband and I love you,
but you're 53 years old.

296
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,942
This job has just gotten too stressful
and difficult, and it's time to quit.

297
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,362
And, miracle of miracles,
he listened.

298
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,615
What a fascinating career
that must have been for him.

299
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,033
It was.

300
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,829
I mean,
NASA was like a second family to us,

301
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,875
but, you know,
it was time for a new adventure.

302
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:15,130
So between
his pension and the income
I bring in from hand modeling,

303
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:19,676
we're, you know, comfortable.
When were these floors redone?

304
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,095
Two years ago.
The counters are brand-new.

305
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,306
I can tell. Travertine.

306
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,099
Nice.

307
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,227
Any children?
No.

308
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,272
I don't really want kids.

309
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,108
Is that horrible for me to say?
Not at all.

310
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,819
Not everyone
has to have children.

311
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,780
You should talk to my husband.
Ha, ha.

312
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,991

Oh, well, thank you, Mimi.

327
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:17,020
It has a very European feel.

328
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,731
- You think?
- Oh, I lived in London for years,

329
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,692
so, yeah, this feels familiar.

330
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,197
Where in London?
I was stationed at Upwood in the '60s.

331
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,574
Downtown,
but we were almost never there.

332
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:33,703
My husband is an illustrator.
We traveled a lot.
Paris, Italy, Denmark.

333
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:37,165
It was before the kids
were in school, so it was
easy to pick up and go.

334
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:41,377
That was before my youngest,
Lucy, was diagnosed
with endocarditis.

335
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,838
Oh, my.
Gosh, is that--?

336
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:47,467
It's a bacterial infection
of the heart valves. It's...

337
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,260
Yeah, it can be...

338
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,096
Oh, that's terrible.

339
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,597
Is she all right?

340
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,477
Your daughter.
Is she okay?

341
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,647
Yes. Thank you. Um--

342
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:04,567
The doctors put in
a prosthetic valve,
so she's-- Lucy's fine.

343
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,362
Running and walking,
riding horses.

344
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,405
- Thank goodness.
- Yeah.

345
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,867
We're very lucky.

346
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:22,252
Excuse me, miss.
Very nice, thank you.

347
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,921
I just called the police.
Okay, then.

348
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,090
I know you stole that spoon.

349
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,051
What are you talking about?

350
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,095
You're a thief.

351
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,931
Excuse me?
And a liar.

352
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,433
Making stories up.
What's wrong with you?

353
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,394
No, what's the matter with you?

354
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:42,063
You better just back off, okay?

355
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:46,609
My husband is a DEA agent.
Oh, I thought he was an astronaut.

356
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,362
Or an illustrator.
Get your crazy lies straight.

357
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,698
You know what, fatty?
You are so lucky

358
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:55,451
that I am late for an appointment.
You're not going anywhere.

359
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,663
- Let go of my purse!
- Not until the police get here.

360
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,206
Let it go!

361
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,876
Let it go! Let it go!

362
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:14,220
You are in big trouble.

363
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,982
Yeah.

364
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,612
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

365
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:34,866
Just slow-- Hey, just--
Slow down. Start from the-- You're--

366
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,577
You're where?

367
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,373
Why the f--?

368
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,334
Why are you--?

369
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:55,261
Are you seriously doing this
to me again?

370
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,227
Jesus, just--

371
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,025
Would you stop crying?

372
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:19,077
I'll make a phone call. Just sit tight.

373
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,998
Where they got you?

374
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,842
So good news. The officer
spoke to the homeowners.

375
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,761
They're not gonna
press charges.

376
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,930
Good. l won't either.

377
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:43,184
Okay, then. So we're good to go.

378
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:46,354
You ready?

379
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:56,114
Marie, you wanna go home?

380
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,873
Marie?

381
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,269
Yes, it's Skyler White
calling for Saul Goodman, please.

382
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,605
Yes, it is important.

383
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,440
Thank you.

384
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,289
Sorry. Same as before.

385
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,874
But this is not right.

386
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,919
You cannot shut me down.
You cannot do this.

387
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,463
I've checked your wastewater
inside and out.

388
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:39,842
I've checked your runoff gutters,
and now out here, more contaminants.

389
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,262
Ammonia, acetone,
benzene, nitrobenzene.

390
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,556
No, no, no, this is a mistake.

391
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,310
Where is Gary? He'll tell you
my soap is very good, very green.

392
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,522
Your soap is not the issue,
it's your filtration system.

393
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,024
The very least,
you'll need to retrofit.

394
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,693
But if you're leeching
into the groundwater,

395
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,987
which is a real possibility here,

396
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,657
you're gonna need
to replace your system.

397
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:03,908
Replace?

398
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,328
Do you know what cost that is?
Two hundred thousand dollars.

399
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,871
It's a hardship.

400
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,250
If you like, we can give you
a list of approved vendors.

401
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:16,295
If you get going, your downtime
shouldn't be any more than five weeks.

402
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,173
Okay. So sorry, you are right.

403
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:24,137
From now on,
we will be extra careful and clean.

404
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,849
No more pollution, okay? Yes?
No, I'm sorry.

405
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,685
The state requires you to suspend
all activity

406
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,563
until these levels
reach the mandated minimums.

407
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:38,234
Where is usual man? Where is Gary?
Got transferred to Las Cruces.

408
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:42,321
If you'd like to file an appeal--
I have done nothing wrong.

409
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,365
Tell me why you shut me down.

410
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,452
What laws did l break?
What laws? Several.

411
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,455
Tell me exact specific laws
or I refuse. Right now.

412
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,208
Tell me what laws l broke.
The specific laws

413
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,127
Hold on. Okay, hold on, hold on.

414
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,254
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

415
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,966
Okay. The New Mexico
Hazardous Waste Act of 1 978,

416
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:06,095
section 74, chapter four,
part 1 3 states:

417
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:09,724
"Whenever the disposal of solid
or hazardous waste presents"...

418
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,143
--an imminent
or substantial endangerment,

419
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,020
the offender may be fined

420
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:17,690
not more than $5000 each day
in which the violation occurs.

421
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,066
All right, okay.

422
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,069
Now the...

423
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,780
Okay, baby.

424
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:31,954
All right. The EPA can cite him
under the Toxic Substances...

425
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,998
--Control Act of 1 976.

426
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,376
U.S. code, title 1 5, chapter 53--

427
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,628
"--subchapter 1 "...

428
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,130
--section 2606.

429
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,342
Satisfied?

430
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,178
Was that specific...

431
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,055
--specific enough for you?

432
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,817
Threw one in the channel in the 1 0th.

433
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,403
- I guess they're even now.
- Yep.

434
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,865
And they're even in this match.
Both have...

435
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,326
- All done with lunch?
- Hm.

436
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:14,580
You hardly touched this.

437
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,207
I'm not hungry.

438
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,126
Well...

439
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,547
I'm leaving the rice pudding.

440
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,507
I'm not hungry, Marie.

441
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,509
So don't eat it.

442
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:32,640
Speaking of babies, he has a new one,
Joseph, and a son, Anthony.

443
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,076
Hey, Marie. How you doing?

444
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,830
I'm okay. Is there a problem?
No, no.

445
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,707
Everything's fine.

446
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,417
I'm here for Hank, actually.

447
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:04,338
Oh, you're so sweet.
Hank'll be thrilled.

448
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,223
Hard and straight.

449
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,350
- And makes it the wrong way.
- Sweetie.

450
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,603
You have a visitor.

451
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,355
Oh, Jesus.

452
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,816
What now?
She rob a bank?

453
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,568
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

454
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,487
Oh, well...

455
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,741
Can't complain.
You know, every day a little better.

456
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,660
That's good. You're looking good.
Yeah, well,

457
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,871
handsome was never the hard part.

458
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,416
Come on in, grab a seat.

459
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,169
Yeah, just throw
that stuff anywhere.

460
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,923
Listen, uh...

461
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:53,554
thanks again for the other day.
You know, this whole thing, it's, uh...

462
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,598
It's been hard on her.

463
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:58,643
Forget it. Glad to help.

464
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,855
So rock collecting?

465
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,150
They're minerals, but, yeah.

466
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:10,821
It's cataloging.
You know, sort them, label them.

467
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,199
It's actually a lot of work.
Yeah.

468
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:16,035
No, it looks like it.

469
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,206
So, what's up?
Well...

470
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,085
Actually, I could use
your help on something.

471
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,629
Homicide. Possibly drug-related.

472
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:31,008
You want my help on a case?
What am I, Ironside?
Heh-heh-heh.

473
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,886
No, you're a drug cop
who knows the local talent.

474
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:37,723
And a pal I just did a favor for,
so let me pick your brain a sec.

475
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:41,644
You ever come across a guy
by the name of Gale Boetticher?

476
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,437
No.

477
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,524
Someone came along
and shot him in the face.

478
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,111
Okay.
No signs of forced entry,

479
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,779
no signs of robbery.

480
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:56,367
Okay, so it's a crime of passion.
Where's the drug angle?

481
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,745
We found a notebook
at his place.

482
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:02,748
I made a copy for you,
in case you're interested.

483
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:07,962
Looks like it pertains to some kind
of methamphetamine superlab.

484
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,213
Yeah.

485
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:13,884
It's filled with scientific formulas
and chemical purchase lists,

486
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,138
drawings,
pages and pages of this stuff.

487
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:22,268
It looks big-time, but I'm no authority,
so I wonder if you might take a look?

488
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,522
Come on, Tim, seriously?

489
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,942
What is this,
some sort of a charity thing?

490
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,153
Your expertise
could be useful here.

491
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,322
I'm lying here like third base,

492
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,075
living from bowel movement
to bowel movement.

493
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,745
I'm not even useful to myself.

494
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,998
Want my advice?

495
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,500
You take this to Steve Gomez.

496
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,795
He'll help you out.
I give this to Steve Gomez

497
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:53,924
and all of a sudden it becomes a
DEA case, what good does that do me?

498
00:34:55,135 --> 00:35:00,097
If you could just take a look,
tell me what I got here.

499
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,433
I'd really appreciate it.

500
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,021
Yeah.

501
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,733
Whatever.

502
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,780
Thanks, man.

503
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,782
Take it easy.

504
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,326
That's what I do. Heh, heh.

505
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,639
No, no.

506
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,974
The three, seven, nine. He says, "No."

507
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:04,411
Well, it was a good try.

508
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,795
Here we go. Time for your nap. Yeah.

509
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,381
Okay.

510
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,262
So...

511
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:26,308
Nail salon sounded promising.
What do you think?

512
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,185
I think we wait.

513
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,854
Wait?

514
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,691
Skyler, it has been five hours.

515
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,401
He'll call.

516
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,862
Just wait.
Just wait.

517
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,405
Look...

518
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,618
It was a good idea.
It was a great idea, but it didn't work.

519
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:48,205
So why don't we simply chalk it up
as a learning--

520
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,299
White residence.

521
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,926
Oh, hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

522
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,762
Am l still interested?

523
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,599
Well, I think that depends.

524
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:11,729
Yes, 879 was the original offer,
but that seems high to me now.

525
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,189
Now l'm offering 800.
No, no, no.

526
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,816
No, don't do that.
Why?

527
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,445
Well, because you're
an unpleasant person,
Mr. Wolynetz.

528
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:22,323
You were rude,
disrespectful towards my husband.

529
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,618
Furthermore, l've met with
quite a number of sellers

530
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:30,331
and the market seems much softer
than I thought, so 800.

531
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,627
Uh-huh. Hm.

532
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:39,381
Well, I understand that you're
disappointed, but that is my final offer.

533
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:43,761
I'm sorry we couldn't make it work.
Goodbye.

534
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:47,181
What are you doing?

535
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,266
I'm negotiating.

536
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,018
Why?

537
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,686
Because l want to pay less.

538
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,396
Oh, no.

539
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,024
Seventy-nine thousand dollars less?

540
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,360
Who cares?
Do you know how much I make?

541
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,613
Yeah, but that's the very reason
we need to negotiate.

542
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:06,325
We don't wanna arouse suspicion
by not trying to get a good deal.

543
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:11,038
Look, I get the logic, l do,
but you just went too far with it.

544
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,581
You're calling him names?

545
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:16,251
I didn't call him names.
I said he was unpleasant.

546
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,341
Well, he's not calling you back.

547
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:26,679
I mean,
you didn't honestly think that worked?

548
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,474
Yeah, I do.

549
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,519
No way. Sorry. No.

550
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:37,022
So look, it's time to move on.

551
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,984
Okay? l'm gonna call Saul.

552
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,403
Where's my phone?

553
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,549
No.
What?

554
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,134
No, just--
What for?

555
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,635
Wait. Wait.

556
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,307
Oh, my God.

557
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,645
Hello.

558
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,606
Hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

559
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,735
No one's paying attention
to where these things are.

560
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:27,448
There's gotta be thousands of them
all over the world coming right for us.

561
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:31,618
And put one inside an ice cream truck,
drive it into San Francisco.

562
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,830
I'm not even that scared
of burning up and cannibalism.

563
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,208
To me, the thing that worries me
is getting trampled

564
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,836
or shoved up
against a chain-link fence.

565
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:44,381
If you think about it,
if you're against a chain-link fence

566
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:49,011
and you've got a lot, I mean,
a lot of people trying to escape,

567
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,638
pushing hard enough forward,
Unh.

568
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,476
you are gonna get squeezed
right through the chain links.

569
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:59,188
Like Play-Doh
or some kind of soft meat.

570
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,231
And this is inevitable, okay?

571
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,735
And there's nothing you or me
or anyone can do about it.

572
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:08,739
And if the fence posts are stuck deep,
really deep with the cement,

573
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,657
way down inside the ground,

574
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,868
it's definitely happening to you.

575
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:16,914
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, bitch.

576
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:20,334
Somebody got shot.
Somebody probably got shot.

577
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:24,797
Like soft meat, man.

578
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:29,551
Right through.
Squeezed through there like soft meat.

579
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,137
Like soft meat.

580
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,766
Right through the chain links,
right through the chain links.

581
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,522
Hey. Hey.

582
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,609
Money!

583
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,079
That one was mine.

584
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,957
- Take it easy!
- Hey, you took mine, man!

585
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,750
Yeah!

586
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,059
Ooh.

587
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:20,602
Whoa.

588
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,273
Aww...

589
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,817
Nice.
Yeah.

590
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,078
To clean cars and clean money.

591
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,914
Hear, hear.

592
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,213
You see?

593
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,215
I told you we'd get it.

594
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,050
Did you?
Mm-hm.

595
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,304
Wow. Ha, ha.

596
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,890
Seriously.

597
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,809
It was really great work.

598
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,769
It's impressive.

599
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,397
Thank you.

600
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,443
And Saul finally came through.
Ahem.

601
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,946
Well, I mean,
he found the guy, right?

602
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:18,035
Well, yes, he found the guy,
but l told him what to do
and what to say.

603
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,038
You're right. That's the hard part.

604
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:26,501
But, yes, Saul was finally useful.
Ha, ha.

605
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,711
Throw him a bone.

606
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:34,009
Mm. Oh, my God.

607
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:37,221
This is truly amazing.
Yes, well, it better be.

608
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,598
Three hundred twenty dollars
a bottle.

609
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:40,974
What?

610
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,228
"Cuvée Pol Roger
Sir Winston Churchill."

611
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,813
Apparently,
it was his favorite champagne,

612
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,233
so they just named it after him.

613
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,736
How did you pay for it?
What do you mean?

614
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,614
Ah. No. Cash, I paid cash.

615
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:59,409
No, I'm asking how did you,
Walter White,

616
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,954
an unemployed schoolteacher,
pay for it?

617
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,081
How do you explain it?
Skyler.

618
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,875
No one saw me.

619
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,585
Whoever sold it to you did.

620
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:12,631
And that's not the point.
The point is we're broke, remember?

621
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:16,760
I'm waiting for your unemployment
check so I can pay the phone bill.

622
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,805
I asked for an extension
from the power company. Why?

623
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:24,434
Because on paper, we have no money.
You are completely overreacting.

624
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:28,730
I'm not apologizing for wanting
to celebrate in some small way.

625
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:31,149
I'm not asking you to apologize,
Walt.

626
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,151
I'm asking you to be smart.

627
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,113
I bought one bottle of champagne.

628
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:39,449
One single bottle, Skyler.

629
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,827
I paid cash. That's it.

630
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:44,871
That's all it takes, okay?
I mean, look at Watergate.

631
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,957
One piece of duct tape
on a door

632
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,960
brought down
the president of the United States.

633
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,920
What? l'm Nixon now?
No.

634
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:54,923
What l'm saying is
the devil is in the details.

635
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:58,510
One little mistake,
one slipup in our story,

636
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,846
that could ruin us.

637
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,602
Fine.

638
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:21,033
Gotta destroy the evidence.

639
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,665
And when l look at this image
that is part of the record,

640
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:32,753
I am very concerned about
what sort of distraction that could be,

641
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,255
whether it's from
any sort of signage,

642
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:38,925
but especially signage that's
changing every five seconds.

643
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,677
Thank you.

644
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,597
Any other questions?

645
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:47,601
We have a motion and a second
on the floor to grant the appeal.

646
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:51,438
All those in favor, raise your hand
and say yes. Yes.

647
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:54,441
There's four in the affirmative.
Those opposed?

648
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:59,029
There's five no's and the--
That motion fails.

649
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,449
I would like to make a motion
to uphold the decision

650
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:05,994
and the findings of the EBC.

651
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:10,207
And the motion, then, is seconded
by Councilor Cook. Any questions?

652
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:15,629
I see none. All those in favor, signify
by saying "yes" to deny the appeal.

653
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,011
All those in favor,
signify by saying "yes."

654
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:26,431
There's five in the affirmative.
All those opposed, say "no."

655
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:29,351
There's four in the negative.
Now, that passes.
