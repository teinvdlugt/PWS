1
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,829
Would you know his full name?

2
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,539
I barely knew the kid.

3
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,416
Jim. Uh...

4
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,961
- Jim.
- James.

5
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,255
James Hurley.

6
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,341
He said he was from Twin Peaks.

7
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,844
He's a drifter.

8
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:04,141
He was probably long gone by the time
Mr. Marsh pulled out of the driveway.

9
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,101
Did he work here long?

10
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,979
Mrs. Marsh hired him
to fix the Jaguar.

11
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,564
Jaguar...

12
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:16,945
J-A-G-W... A car.

13
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,447
How did you meet him, Mrs. Marsh?

14
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,618
Jeffrey's Jaguar broke down
near Wallies.

15
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,370
I went in to use the phone.

16
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,415
He offered to help.

17
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,127
Okay, we'll check that. Thank you.

18
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,345
And so we bid adieu
to James Hurley.

19
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,847
Give it a rest.

20
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,642
Careful, Evelyn.

21
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:50,145
I'm not sure I can tolerate
a nervous co-conspirator.

22
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:54,233
I just want it over with, all right?

23
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,945
Anything you say, Mrs. Marsh.

24
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,013
James, we can't get out of this
by ourselves.

25
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,099
We're gonna need someone
to help us.

26
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,518
I didn't do anything.

27
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,813
Malcolm killed Mr. Marsh.
I'm being framed.

28
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,773
Can I get you something,
Miss Hayward?

29
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,067
No. No, thank you.

30
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,783
Look, it doesn't make any difference.

31
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,786
We can't wait for the cops
to catch us.

32
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,206
- I think I should call Ed.
- No, no, don't.

33
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,209
I gotta... My only chance
is to talk to Evelyn myself.

34
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:58,505
If she told me that this was all a setup,
maybe she'll just tell the police that too.

35
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,340
You're sure?

36
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,134
Yeah.

37
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,471
You wouldn't have a chance.
The cops will be waiting for you.

38
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,598
We've gotta keep moving.

39
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,351
She'd listen to me though.
I know she would.

40
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,270
Would she?

41
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,648
Why?

42
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,404
I'm gonna go call Ed.

43
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,364
Stay here.

44
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,372
Hi, Ed? Hi, it's Donna.

45
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:36,918
Listen, I don't have a lot of time,
but I think James is in trouble.

46
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,046
Well, he's been working
for this woman.

47
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,798
Uh, working on her car, um,

48
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,718
and I think
there's been this accident and...

49
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,596
Hi, how are you doing, Yvette?

50
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,349
Listen, I heard about
your new boyfriend.

51
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,894
Yeah, that's great, really.

52
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,145
Good to hear it.

53
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,647
So tell me about him.

54
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,617
- Excuse me.
- Hi, Frank.

55
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,621
What were you doing
at Shelly's house last night, Bobby?

56
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,540
Shelly almost gets murdered and
you're worried about what I'm doing?

57
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,750
What about Leostein?

58
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,253
What were you doing
at Shelly's house?

59
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,132
Look, here's the deal.

60
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,969
Shelly and I are together, okay?

61
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,014
We have been for a long time,
since before Laura died,

62
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,309
before and after Leo
went into his drool mode.

63
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,727
Bobby?

64
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,022
Where were you
the night the mill burned?

65
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,233
What's that got to do with this?

66
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,527
Leo tried to kill you.

67
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,696
- Maybe you shot him.
- No way.

68
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,865
I went to Shelly's
the night the mill burned down,

69
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,367
because I was worried about her.

70
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,077
He was about to bury an ax
in my head

71
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,121
when Hank Jennings shot him
through the window.

72
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,832
- You sure it was Hank?
- Absolutely.

73
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,167
What's Hank's connection with Leo?

74
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,044
I don't know, man.
Why don't you tell me?

75
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:05,215
Shelly, do you have any idea
where Leo might be now?

76
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,884
No, I don't.

77
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:12,180
I'll assign a couple of my deputies
to the house 24 hours a day.

78
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,391
Hey, man,
I can take care of Shelly all right.

79
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,226
You can just save the deputies.

80
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,603
Bobby Briggs,

81
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,855
button it.

82
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,316
- You can go now.
- Okay.

83
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,653
Shelly, don't worry, we're not
gonna let you out of our sight.

84
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,697
- Thank you.
- Come on, Shelly.

85
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,741
I feel so much safer,
don't you, Shelly?

86
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,326
Bobby.

87
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,128
Get a life, punk.

88
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,588
Gentlemen.

89
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,215
Another trip on the "Seattle
to Twin Peaks" shuttle.

90
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,717
How are you?

91
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,178
- Looking good, Harry.
- Yeah.

92
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,305
- Albert.
- Coop.

93
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,933
- Gentlemen.
- What have you got?

94
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,144
My invite back to Twin Peaks.

95
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,564
Windom Earle.
Direct orders from Gordon Cole.

96
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,357
As he so succinctly put it:

97
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,152
"I'm worried about Coop."

98
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:18,205
Springfield, Kansas City,
Lawton, Dallas, Jackson.

99
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,040
Earle's been sending
gift-wrapped packages

100
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,585
to police departments
and major law enforcement agencies.

101
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,338
Each looks like a mail bomb,
but they turn out to be harmless.

102
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,549
The deliveries were paid for by a phony
credit card signed Windom Earle.

103
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,510
What's in the boxes?

104
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,387
One article of clothing in each.

105
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:41,436
One, a white veil, two, a garter,
three, a pair of white slippers,

106
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:46,149
four, a pearl necklace,
and finally, a wedding dress.

107
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,610
Caroline's.

108
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,489
He's got DEA and FBI,
not to mention Mississippi, Oklahoma

109
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,991
and Illinois State patrols
looking for him.

110
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,452
Everyone's invited to the party.

111
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,872
But my guess is, he won't dance
with anyone but you, Coop.

112
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,589
The vagrant from the office died
from a knife wound severing the aorta.

113
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,384
This guy's finger is pointed
directly at this chess piece.

114
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,053
How did Earle manage that
with the rigor mortis?

115
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,930
Well, rigor mortis goes
from head to toe.

116
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,891
But after two days,
it leaves the body from toe to head.

117
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,602
So he waited for it to leave
the arms and the fingers

118
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,897
so they could be maneuvered
onto the chess board.

119
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,651
And then he played Zeus
at the power station.

120
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,028
- What was found?
- This map.

121
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,698
Taped to the bottom of a table.

122
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,825
Good work, Albert.

123
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,587
He's making his move.
Most definitely.

124
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,505
Yeah.

125
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,095
Oh, Coop, uh, about the uniform.

126
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,555
Yes, Albert?

127
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,890
Replacing the quiet elegance
of the dark suit and tie

128
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,102
with the casual indifference
of these muted earth tones

129
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,398
is a form of fashion suicide,
but, uh, call me crazy.

130
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,484
- On you, it works.
- Heh.

131
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,695
Thank you, Albert.

132
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,025
Ah, you're awake then.

133
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,320
Heh. I trust you've slept well?

134
00:10:55,488 --> 00:11:00,158
While you've slept,
I've learned all about you.

135
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,286
Leo Johnson.

136
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,790
The police would like to see you
as soon as possible.

137
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,959
Now, let me see.

138
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,213
Ah! Drug trafficking.

139
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,716
Arson. Ooh, ha, ha.

140
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,260
Attempted murder.

141
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:24,349
Domestic violence.
Now I am partial to that.

142
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,896
Well, Leo, I've cleansed your wounds.

143
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,189
You're on the mend.

144
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,776
I've removed the proverbial thorn
from your paw.

145
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,446
Leo. Leo the lion.

146
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,075
Now...

147
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,953
I want you to help me.

148
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,163
And obey me.

149
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,666
Will you do that? Hmm?

150
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,296
Did you know that,
in the 13th century in Japan,

151
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,299
the samurai were stripped
of their weaponry.

152
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:02,679
But they discovered that the aged
and treated bamboo

153
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:07,851
of their shakuhachi flute
made an excellent cudgel.

154
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:15,608
This flute
is truly an instrument of pleasure.

155
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,569
Don't you think?

156
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,820
Meow.

157
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,535
I wanted to save this necklace
for an occasion,

158
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,079
but you've ruined it.

159
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,248
Ha, ha. Meow.

160
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,378
Now...

161
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,630
Come over here.

162
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:42,135
Mm. I've made you some gruel.

163
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,646
Come on, Leo, eat your gruel.

164
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,107
Yum, yum. Mm, heh.

165
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,870
It's been 20 years, babe.

166
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,290
One day we're talking
about a graduation party

167
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,918
and the next day we're here.

168
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,590
And in between
nothing but a world of hurt.

169
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,724
I tried not to think about it.

170
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,852
I just spent
more and more time at the diner,

171
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,855
trying to make the place work.

172
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,483
Because I had nothing else.

173
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,362
We were open every day,

174
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,199
so I wouldn't have to have
another life.

175
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,953
No birthdays,

176
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,247
no Fourth of July,

177
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,583
no Christmas.

178
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:04,676
Well, I turned all my Christmases
into a week full of Mondays.

179
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,428
When that didn't work,

180
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:12,517
I thought about all the presents
I never bought you.

181
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,894
Never got to give you.

182
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,109
I bought you a present
last Christmas.

183
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:26,239
It was a turquoise and onyx bolo tie.

184
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,618
I walked over to your house
to give it to you,

185
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,498
but I couldn't go in.

186
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,584
I just waited.

187
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,086
I could see you through the window.

188
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,382
I don't know why I couldn't go in.

189
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,556
I'm sorry I didn't.

190
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,518
All that time,

191
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,981
you should have been in my home.

192
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,736
In my bed.

193
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,114
It's about the future now, Ed.

194
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,867
And what we're gonna do about it.

195
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:17,123
I want you to come tonight
after I close the diner.

196
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,292
Take me home.

197
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,919
You're right.

198
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,379
It's all ahead of us.

199
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,549
Plenty of time.

200
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,552
Eddie?

201
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,763
- Eddie?
- No, no, no.

202
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,390
I may as well talk to her now.

203
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,114
Hello, Nadine.

204
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:54,327
I got all the way
to the district finals at Knife River,

205
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:59,624
only to find out
the airplane slam is illegal.

206
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,795
I was disqualified.

207
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,173
Second place, what a drag.

208
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,593
Oh, boy, what a tough break, huh?

209
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,221
Hello, Nadine.

210
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,893
I owe you an apology, Norma.

211
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:23,231
I mean, I really pounded Hank
and I am sorry.

212
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,568
But I thought he was gonna do
something to Eddie.

213
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,947
And I sort of got mad.

214
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,658
Thank you.

215
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,744
Eh.

216
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,127
Know what?

217
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,754
I know about you guys.

218
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,674
It's really, really okay.

219
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,428
Because I don't have to feel so guilty
about me and Mike.

220
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,887
You and Mike?

221
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,724
I don't wanna get into it,
but I have to tell you,

222
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:01,227
it is really, really serious.

223
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,690
So you guys can go ahead
and do whatever you want.

224
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,944
I am completely cool
about all of this.

225
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,239
Really.

226
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,510
Josie...

227
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,138
This is it.

228
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,976
The Seattle police want answers
and I have to tell them something.

229
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,605
They know you were connected
with Jonathan.

230
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,232
How did he die?

231
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,818
He was shot three times
in the back of the head.

232
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,572
Josie...

233
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,950
If you were ever gonna tell the truth,

234
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,874
now would be an ideal time.

235
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,502
Think I'll get another cup of joe.

236
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,720
Ah.

237
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,185
Is that you, Pete?

238
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,730
- Yeah. Cooper?
- Yeah.

239
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,818
I get over to the Clean and Save

240
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:35,822
and Jeanie Pombelek
is working the counter.

241
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:39,325
She does not speak
one word of English.

242
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,411
Nada, zip.

243
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,705
She's from Budapest.

244
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,707
We just stood there
and looked at each other

245
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,085
like we were made of wood.

246
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,629
- Who does all this belong to, Pete?
- Oh...

247
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,092
Catherine's been running her
into the ground.

248
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,052
- Need a hand?
- So I offered to stop

249
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,723
by the dry cleaners
and pick up Josie's stuff.

250
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:07,645
You know, the only words I know
in Hungarian are paprika and goulash.

251
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,856
It took me 20 minutes
to get this stuff.

252
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,693
Let me get that. Give me a hand.

253
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,197
Hello.

254
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,074
Just hold a minute.

255
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:24,787
- It's for Josie. Is she here?
- She's in the other room, Pete.

256
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,478
- Hello.
- Josie.

257
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,397
It's Thomas.

258
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,609
I'm so glad I've found you.

259
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,945
I was wondering
if we could get together.

260
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,783
Did you hear about
what happened to Jonathan?

261
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,038
Dreadful.

262
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,209
Welcome to Twin Peaks,
Mr. Eckhardt.

263
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,385
She's run back to Catherine Martell.

264
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,387
I'm so disappointed.

265
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,315
So I asked Stonewall Jackson
what he would like to do

266
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,484
after we run the Yankees
up to Canada.

267
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,738
He said: "Follow them.
I wanna be the Duke of Montréal."

268
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,743
Oh, that Stonewall.

269
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,078
I once asked him

270
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,039
what he thought
I should do with Lincoln.

271
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,126
And he says, "Old Honest Abe
is about as useful to you

272
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,922
as a spittoon cleaner
in a whorehouse."

273
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,471
Whoa! Whoa, traveler. Whoa!

274
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,348
What do you think, Dr. Jacoby?

275
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,143
Ah, letting him out to mingle with the
public doesn't seem to have helped.

276
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,688
Well, you have to admit,
he's kind of fun this way.

277
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,899
What's the matter with you?
That's my father, your brother.

278
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,777
We can't leave him like this.

279
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,737
Well, now, Audrey, honey, now.

280
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:27,118
There are some advantages
to leaving him, click, click, insane.

281
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,788
Told me that every man,
woman and child...

282
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,541
Now, Audrey,
you know I was upset too,

283
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,336
but there's some projects,
both domestic and international,

284
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,046
that I'd might get a chance
to develop.

285
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:43,634
I mean, one man's crisis
is another man's opportunity.

286
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,636
Let me tell you something,
Uncle Jerry.

287
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:50,641
We leave him the way he is,
and I become executor of the estate.

288
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,311
Audrey, it's a little more complicated
than that, sweetheart.

289
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,439
No, it isn't.
I've examined his will, Jerry.

290
00:21:56,606 --> 00:22:01,152
If my father becomes incapacitated,
it all goes to me when I'm old enough.

291
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,365
And I am old enough, Jer,
and he is incapacitated.

292
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,868
I have my way either way.

293
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,413
When the only project
you'll be developing

294
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,625
is selling baseboard heaters
at the local Cash 'n' Carry.

295
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,672
What's happened to the man
is a tragedy.

296
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,383
It is a tragedy, Jer.

297
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:33,434
Dr. Jacoby,
I want you to bring my father back.

298
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,228
- To the office?
- Parade, rest!

299
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,356
To the real world.

300
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:44,195
I think it's time we implement
the Appomattox scenario.

301
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,782
Hey, sorry I'm late. A couple of bikers
tried to take this jacket.

302
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,368
But old Stonewall's
gone from me now,

303
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,662
cut down in a hail of Yankee lead.

304
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,706
He died alone,

305
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,376
without my comfort.

306
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,585
Laddy.

307
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,380
Come here.

308
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,966
You know what I wanna hear.
Troops, about face.

309
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,511
"Dixie." "Dixie"!

310
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,805
Forward, march.

311
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:16,018
Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton

312
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,230
Old times there were not forgotten

313
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:26,112
Look away, look away, look away
Dixie land

314
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,405
Oh, I wish...

315
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,508
Mrs. Marsh?

316
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,178
I'm Donna, James' friend.

317
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,267
I remember you.

318
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,269
Get the lady here a drink.

319
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,938
With a little umbrella in it.

320
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,691
Go on, dear, sit down, it's all right.

321
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,777
- Why are you doing this to James?
- Why not?

322
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,654
Because he's a good person.

323
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,032
He was good at two things:

324
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,201
The car and me.

325
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,080
You don't get it, do you?
I'm talking about our lives.

326
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:24,336
Life. Life will be rosy if you can
just get out of one silly little jam.

327
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,088
Maybe.

328
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,299
Maybe not.

329
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,758
Talk to me in a couple of years

330
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,344
when your whole life
has turned to crap.

331
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,181
You really like to make everything
sound pointless and stupid.

332
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,435
If there was a reason to climb out
of this primeval swill,

333
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,146
believe me, dear, I'd know it.

334
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,689
Would you, really?

335
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:48,402
Oh, here we are.
The car's waiting, Mrs. Marsh.

336
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,279
Get in it.

337
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,706
I'm sorry about your friend, honey.
There's nothing you can do.

338
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,376
So why don't you trundle along
to your little town,

339
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:09,381
safe in the knowledge that,
if I ever see you here again,

340
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,051
I'll kill you.

341
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:18,307
Don't do this to him, please!

342
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,351
Please.

343
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,117
Coop, take a look at this.

344
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,704
Vicuña thread sample
taken from Josie's coat.

345
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,499
Traces found on the floor
outside your room.

346
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,501
They're from the same coat?

347
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,546
Let me put it to you this way,
either Josie Packard pulled the trigger,

348
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,881
or she's loaning her winter wear
to the wrong people.

349
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,967
- It's a perfect match.
- What about the gloves?

350
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,719
Checking for powder burns.
I'll have the results in the morning.

351
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,929
From the Seattle Homicide?

352
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,390
Locals are looking
for a beautiful Asian woman,

353
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,810
late 20s, in connection with the murder
of one Jonathan Kumagai.

354
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,104
He has an Interpol sheet
as long as your arm

355
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,690
and three holes
in the back of his head.

356
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:11,443
I'm betting the bullets will match
the slugs we took from your vest.

357
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,531
I hope it's not Josie,
for Harry's sake.

358
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:20,411
Coop, as you know, Truman and I
have had our differences in the past.

359
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,872
But the big lug's got his heart
in the right place, if nothing else.

360
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,167
And I'm not above feeling a little
sympathy for the stalwart and the dull.

361
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,211
- What's you point, Albert?
- Speaking frankly?

362
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,297
Feel free.

363
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,717
Our sheriff's got a serious problem
with his girlfriend.

364
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,141
Albert,

365
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,144
not one word until we're certain.

366
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:46,979
Ah.

367
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,192
Coop.

368
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,195
Our John Doe's got a name:

369
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:59,158
Erik Powell. Transient.
Former merchant marine by his prints.

370
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,951
Powell?

371
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,662
Yeah, ring a bell?

372
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,583
Powell was Caroline's
maiden name.

373
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,254
Do you think
this Powell is a relative?

374
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:16,050
No. Earle's playing
the game according to his own rules.

375
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,886
Every move he makes
sends a message.

376
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,554
The fact that he chose
the name Powell

377
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,265
tells me he hasn't forgotten a thing
that went on between us.

378
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:27,394
So whenever he takes a piece
from the board...

379
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,938
Someone dies.

380
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,859
I never beat him, Harry.

381
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,445
Coop, if you've got a need
for a chess expert,

382
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,739
we've got one of the best
right here in town.

383
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,534
Checkmate.

384
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,746
Checkmate.

385
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,417
And mate.

386
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,048
Frankly, I am impressed.

387
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,053
I owe it all
to the great José Raúl Capablanca.

388
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,514
Now, if there's chess boards
in heaven,

389
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,058
José's sitting next to the Lord.

390
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,353
- Doc?
- The mind reels.

391
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,772
- One of these days.
- Ha, ha.

392
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,358
Pete, I need your help.

393
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,860
I'm playing a chess match
of considerable importance.

394
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,278
I can't say any more than that.

395
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,365
Suffice to say,
I'd like to stalemate the game,

396
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:25,994
losing as few pieces as possible.
None, if that can be arranged.

397
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:30,958
Well, Agent Cooper,
I'd be proud to serve.

398
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,001
Thanks, Pete.

399
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:37,297
Great players are either far or few.

400
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,812
- Hi.
- Shelly.

401
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,189
I'm sorry about what happened.

402
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,150
Are you okay?

403
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,027
Not really.

404
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,238
I wanted to come right over,

405
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,700
but with Hank gone,
it's been a madhouse here.

406
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:09,413
You, um, don't need any help,
do you?

407
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,375
Um, I... I'd...

408
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,128
I'd feel safer, Norma.

409
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,089
Are you kidding?

410
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,425
It hasn't been the same without you.

411
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,677
When can you start?

412
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:30,100
- Um, now?
- Great. Welcome back.

413
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,269
Thank you.

414
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,479
Norma?

415
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:34,938
- Hi, Shelly.
- Hi.

416
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:39,109
Excuse me.
Uh, I need to talk to you for a minute.

417
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,535
There's something you should know.

418
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,663
Hank's nearly ready
to leave the hospital.

419
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,458
What about his parole violations?

420
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,877
Harry, this time
I don't want him back.

421
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,964
Don't worry. He won't be back.
Hank's going to jail.

422
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,550
We're charging him with
the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.

423
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,928
Add that to breaking parole,

424
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,097
Hank's going away for a long time.

425
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,684
Good.

426
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,042
Mr. Eckhardt, welcome.

427
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,295
Josie, help our guest with his coat.

428
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:51,598
I must confess I received
your invitation with some surprise.

429
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,560
Well, word travels fast
in Twin Peaks.

430
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:58,522
I thought it was fitting that I dined
with my late brother's business rival.

431
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,148
Some wine, Josie.

432
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,776
Your brother was not
always my rival. We were friends.

433
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,445
- But your friendship soured.
- Sadly.

434
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,866
Men of business frequently find
their personal lives disrupted

435
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,034
by the larger portraits they paint.

436
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,413
You consider yourself an artist?
The wine, Josie.

437
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:18,000
Of a sort. Your brother was as well.

438
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,294
I wonder, Mr. Eckhardt.

439
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:24,172
When you had him killed,
was it for art or money?

440
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,843
- Don't stand there, Josie, pour.
- Call me Thomas. Your brother did.

441
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:31,096
Thomas. We'll have
our hors d'oeuvres now, Josie.

442
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,348
One does not kill for art or money.

443
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:37,060
They are commodities easily lost
and just as easily gained.

444
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:43,609
However, one, rather I,
might find reason to kill for love.

445
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:47,654
- Did you love her that much?
- Yes.

446
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,449
Josie has the most
incredible hands.

447
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,659
Every finger a thing of beauty.

448
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,745
I remember.

449
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,628
I wonder,
what shall we do about her?

450
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:06,381
It would be a shame
if you left empty-handed.

451
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,928
Of course,
I'll miss her cheery disposition.

452
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,513
We've become the best of friends.

453
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,599
Two girls chatting over tea.

454
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,393
Perhaps you should purchase
an animal of some kind.

455
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,895
A cat or a dog.

456
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,357
If I give her to you,
what will you give me in return?

457
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:27,569
How can I place a value
on something so precious?

458
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,951
But you will try?

459
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,453
Yes.

460
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,957
Josie.

461
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,710
Thomas and I
will have our main course now.

462
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,285
Why did you do it?

463
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,292
You know I've been going through it.

464
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,212
- I can't figure it out.
- James, you're not safe here.

465
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,007
- If Malcolm finds you...
- Is it the money?

466
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,634
Is that it? No. No, I got it.

467
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:37,222
It was Malcolm. Oh, yeah.
He made you do it. Right?

468
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,184
You better tell me a story, Evelyn.
Because I'm all mixed up.

469
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,186
I just wanna know
why you would do this to me.

470
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,230
James.

471
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:51,987
What did you expect? An apology?
A hidden heart of gold?

472
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,906
I did it all, James. I did everything.

473
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:59,202
I found you, I lured you in
and I kept you here,

474
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,540
while Malcolm planned
a nice, neat little frame.

475
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,461
- Why?
- For the money.

476
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,337
Out of fear.

477
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,382
Because I wanted to do it.

478
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,094
It's not exactly what you wanted
to hear, is it, James?

479
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:19,056
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

480
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:25,812
James, you're good
and you're honest.

481
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,106
I'm not.

482
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,983
But that doesn't mean
there weren't moments

483
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,736
when I truly wanted you here.

484
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,906
Not for Malcolm,

485
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,493
or for the money, but for me.

486
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,705
For the good and honest way
that you taste.

487
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,461
I like how you taste too.

488
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:58,303
Malcolm, what did you do?
James, James. You hurt him.

489
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,852
He broke into the house,

490
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,064
he was angry, he was crazy.

491
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:14,486
He killed Jeffrey
and he came back to kill you.

492
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,489
You poor, defenseless little widow.

493
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,200
But you were ready for him, Evelyn.

494
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,536
You got your gun,

495
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,288
and you shot James.

496
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,083
You shot him until he was dead.

497
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,954
- General Lee.
- Whoa.

498
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,919
Welcome to our humble horse...
Home, General Lee.

499
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,756
- Thank you. And you are?
- Scarlett McLean.

500
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,758
And this is my father...

501
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,720
- This is my father.
- Oh.

502
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,308
Wilmer McLean at your service.

503
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,519
I'm indeed honored to be making
your extremely sociable acquaintance.

504
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:33,356
And why are you armed
with my sword, sir?

505
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,817
I like your sword, sire.

506
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,613
- Thank you, Daddy. Thank you.
- Where is General Grant?

507
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,282
General Grant's a-coming, sire,
I know it.

508
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,284
Excuse us.

509
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,504
General Grant.

510
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,340
General Lee.

511
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:02,052
Sir, we met during the Mexican War.
Do you remember?

512
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,554
I have come to surrender the North.

513
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,932
The Mexican War, sir.
Do you remember?

514
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,060
JACOBY; Oh, yes, yes.
It was a good war, as I remember.

515
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,730
Nonsense.
All wars are nothing but madness.

516
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:18,026
Disguised as the patriotic ventures
of politicians,

517
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,655
too old and too cowardly
to participate in them.

518
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,699
- No, no, sir, I have no love for war.
- Me neither.

519
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,244
- And even less for politicians.
- Hey, amen.

520
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:31,039
But, as for the men who fight them,

521
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:36,169
they have my eternal respect
and sympathy.

522
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:41,424
All right, general,
enough of this fruitless conversation.

523
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,885
My terms:

524
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:47,180
Federal officers
may keep their sidearms

525
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,100
and other general possessions.

526
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:54,187
Officers and men claiming to own
their own horses may keep them too.

527
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:59,276
And, uh, officers and men will be
allowed to return to their home,

528
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,946
not to be disturbed
by the Confederate States' authorities.

529
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,533
- I surrender.
- Of course you do.

530
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,910
The articles.

531
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,291
- Here, sire, the articles.
- Sir.

532
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,751
The articles, sir.

533
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,839
- You will sign, General Grant.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

534
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:25,385
And may I add that, that you've been
a valiant opponent of fine character.

535
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,179
I thought the North won
the Civil War?

536
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,948
Ben?

537
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,076
Ben.

538
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,411
Daddy.

539
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,334
- Ben? Ben?
- Daddy?

540
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,210
Hey, give him some room.

541
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,171
Where am I?

542
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,341
- Where am I?
- Twin Peaks, Ben.

543
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:10,555
Oh. I had the strangest dream.

544
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,098
Heh.

545
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,643
And you were there.

546
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,230
And you, and you.

547
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,816
It was incredible.

548
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,277
It was a war.

549
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,863
And I was General...

550
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,533
General Robert E. Lee.

551
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:36,081
And somehow,
in spite of incredible odds,

552
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,208
I won.

553
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,335
Now you're home, Daddy.

554
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,295
Yes.

555
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,508
- I'm home.
- Attaboy, Ben. Ha, ha.

556
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:50,512
How do you feel?
Any, any aftereffects? Dizziness?

557
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,391
I feel terrific.

558
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,728
- I feel, uh...
- Yes?

559
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:02,482
- What is it, Daddy?
- What are you doing in those clothes?

560
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,823
Attaboy, Ben.

561
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,200
What? What's the joke?

562
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,621
Attaboy, Ben.

563
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,422
Work slowly.

564
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,007
And with care.

565
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:34,472
Everything must be written
with a steady, uncompromising hand.

566
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,769
No, no, no.

567
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,688
Terrible.

568
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:45,733
Erase.

569
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,407
Now...

570
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,492
Try again.

571
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,290
Concentrate.

572
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,710
Leo, for heaven's sake.

573
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,673
Here. Shh, shh, shh.

574
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,009
Let me show you.

575
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,760
Like this:

576
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,638
There you go.

577
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,433
Much better.

578
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:23,271
I am proud of you, Leo.

579
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:39,913
- Windom Earle?
- Yes.

580
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,915
Windom.

581
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,416
Heh.

582
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:48,338
Pretty words for pretty girls.

583
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,341
Which one shall be my queen?

584
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,885
Queen?

585
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,768
No. No.

586
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,311
No.

587
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,356
Lick.

588
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,162
The story rings a little truer
with your fingerprints on...

589
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,413
No, Malcolm, I can't.

590
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,083
Just your prints.
Leave the rest to me.

591
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,585
I'll do my best to imitate
the actions of a hysteric.

592
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,671
Five shots, tightly grouped,

593
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,715
as though the gun went off
in your hand.

594
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,926
- Repeatedly.
- No!

595
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:39,722
No! No! James, James, James.

596
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,309
- Don't hurt him any more, please.
- Give me the gun.

597
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,812
I've called the cops.
They're on their way, it won't work.

598
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,772
- Malcolm.
- She's lying. Give me the gun.

599
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,776
Evelyn,
please don't let him die, please.

600
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,445
- Please.
- Evelyn.

601
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,532
Give me the gun, Evelyn.

602
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,993
- Evelyn, give me the gun.
- No.

603
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,745
- Evelyn, give me the gun.
- No.

604
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:06,040
Evelyn. Evelyn.

605
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,918
I can't do this, Malcolm.

606
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,379
Then I will.

607
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,803
No.

608
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,031
He was angry,

609
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,907
he was crazy.

610
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:44,787
He killed Jeffrey,
came back to kill me.

611
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,206
I was ready, though.

612
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,878
I got my gun and I shot him.

613
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,965
I shot him till he was dead.

614
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,329
Caroline.

615
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:38,675
For Miss Audrey Horne, please.

616
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,594
Owls?

617
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,639
Breathtaking, wasn't she?

618
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,476
A truly beautiful woman, Caroline.

619
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,061
Funny, isn't it?

620
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,771
After all this time,

621
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,817
after all that happened
in Pittsburgh,

622
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,862
I still love her.

623
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:44,073
And I know that you do too.

624
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:48,327
Now, Dale, listen carefully.

625
00:45:48,495 --> 00:46:46,844
It's your move.
