11
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,235
You want me to open the doors?

12
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,740
Here. The keys. Take them.

13
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,077
Why you talking?

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,539
No! No, no, no--

15
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,892
Gambling destroyed my life.

16
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:14,772
Me, my family,
everything l loved.

17
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,985
It was like a robbery,
only l was the thief.

18
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:23,072
It's amazing the stories you tell
yourself to justify it.

19
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,870
The lies that lead you
to just one more hand,
one more spin,

20
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,999
one more roll of the dice.

21
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:37,837
This is our deal, okay? Marie, no.

22
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,506
You guys are not lifting a finger.
I mean it.

23
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:45,469
Yeah, we're bringing everything. So--
This is not up for debate, okay?

24
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,221
Great.

25
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:51,100
Sweetie, don't worry. We're not
gonna say one word about the bills.

26
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,519
We just wanna bring everyone
up to speed.

27
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,647
All right, I'll see you soon. Bye.

28
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,529
So...

29
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:08,034
tonight's the night.
No turning back.

30
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,037
Well...

31
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,206
Okay. Let's do this.

32
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,669
Okay. So first,
I assign point values.

33
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,172
Correlate to the effect of removal.

34
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,759
You're gonna split the eights?
Skyler, please.

35
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:29,513
Now, the mathematical principle
known as the Kelly Criterion,

36
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,891
upon which I devised
my own strategy--

37
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,101
Not dissimilar to the MlT system--

38
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,645
Walt, you're not teaching them.

39
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,274
You wanted me to be thorough.
Play. You're taking too long.

40
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:44,028
You don't think it behooves me
to be able to explain any of this?

41
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:48,824
It behooves you to be a pro,
that's all. That's the fiction.
So chop-chop.

42
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,577
Don't "chop-chop" me.
Walt.

43
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,622
Now, we both know
that the first decision

44
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,750
is whether or not to split
or to surrender.

45
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,127
On eights. Split them.

46
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,214
Good on both.

47
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,217
Next decision is whether
to double down or not.

48
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,637
Which you should be doing.
On an 1 1 , yes. Double.

49
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,140
Okay, this hand over here,
we have a soft 1 8.

50
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:17,603
The final decision
is whether or not
to hit or to stand. Hit it.

51
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,315
Becomes a hard 1 5.
Dealer has a nine.

52
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,109
I see that.
Hm.

53
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,570
Hit it.
Oh.

54
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,906
Okay, let's see what I got.

55
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,493
And 21 .

56
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,911
Damn.
Yup.

57
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,083
Okay, the key thing
to remember here is that
it's not about any one hand.

58
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,669
The key is the number
of hands per hour.

59
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,839
Mm. Let's go again.

60
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:50,094
Zero, minus one, 0.6.

61
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,513
Okay.

62
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,059
Walt.
It's not as if I don't know how to play.

63
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,604
I certainly more than understand
how to count cards.

64
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,106
Let's just keep going.

65
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,192
No, you know what?
I'm in recovery, remember?

66
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,236
I shouldn't even be playing.

67
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,323
And that is the fiction
that we should be sticking to.

68
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,117
You know what?

69
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:19,331
You're right. Yeah.
Wow.

70
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,669
Okay. Um-- We're not leaving
anything to chance.

71
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:28,299
All right. Let's get started.
Got a lot of, uh--

72
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:33,262
Walt. We got a lot of ground to cover.
What is this?

73
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,099
We have to get our story
straight. We've gotta be
on the same page.

74
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,059
A script?
Bullet points.

75
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,188
Bullet points?
We got a novella.

76
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:46,734
This is smart.
You really wanna try
to sell a DEA agent

77
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,862
some full-of-holes story
about how we suddenly

78
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,697
have enough money
to buy a car wash?

79
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,783
Am l supposed to memorize this?
We need to practice.

80
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,328
We need to be word-perfect.
Within reason.

81
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,330
We need this story to be solid

82
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,791
and sympathetic and,
most of all, completely believable.

83
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,085
The story that
you already told Marie.

84
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,755
You think that
she hasn't told Hank? Ha.

85
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,216
Come on, this is Marie
we're talking about here.

86
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,259
No, she hasn't.
Heh.

87
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,677
She hasn't.

88
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,597
Hank thinks his insurance
is paying for everything.

89
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,850
Marie's not telling him
we are paying his therapy bills.

90
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,394
And neither are we.
And why is that again?

91
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:26,732
Really?
If we have the gambling story...

92
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,613
Did you take money, Walt?
You remember Gretchen and Elliot?

93
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,116
I seem to recall that you'd rather
sell drugs than take help.

94
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,078
Fine.
Marie will tell Hank in her own time.

95
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,622
And at least we'll have laid
the groundwork.

96
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,750
And coming clean with Hank
and Juni--

97
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:52,216
Appearing to come clean will be
the best thing for everyone.

98
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,801
We talked about this.

99
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:58,597
Okay? We agreed about this.
Yes, we did. lt's just...

100
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,891
What?

101
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,644
Never mind. Just--

102
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:09,942
Okay. So I really think
we should tag team
the narrative, okay?

103
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,155
We'll each be responsible for
certain portions of the story
and then we can, uh--

104
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,451
We can hand off so we
don't leave anything out,
and it'll seem natural.

105
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,621
Okay. So I'm gonna launch
with the exciting news

106
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,207
that we are buying
a car wash.

107
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,542
Yay.

108
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,170
The next logical question
Hank will probably ask is:

109
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,757
"Where are you
getting the money?"
To which I'll say:

110
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,885
We wanna tell you
the whole story.
It's a doozy,

111
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,180
so hold onto your hats.

112
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,641
Do you like that?

113
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,561
Sure.

114
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:50,149
It accomplishes two things.
It keeps it light while
letting them know

115
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,609
to expect something big.
Uh-huh.

116
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,488
Yeah. No. lt's a doozy.

117
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:01,160
Okay. Anyway, that's
where you will take over,
starting with your diagnosis.

118
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,704
Pages one and two.
Okay. And it's--

119
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,916
It's pretty much gonna
run parallel to the truth,
which makes it easier.

120
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,128
But just make sure
to really hit the cancer.

121
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,422
Really touch on the fear
and despair.

122
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,425
It's good to remind them
and to get their sympathy.

123
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,678
We want them to understand why
you could do something so stupid.

124
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:26,226
Now, after that, per pages three
and four, after you say:

125
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,813
"Gambling became an addiction
and I just couldn't control it."

126
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,440
Do you see that?
Yes.

127
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,900
In the middle. Okay.

128
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:37,071
I put in that line about robbery,
from the GA meeting. That was good.

129
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:41,075
So next, I'll chime in about how
it affected our marriage,

130
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,537
starting with the confusion,
the deceit, why we couldn't
tell anyone--

131
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,957
I'm terribly, terribly ashamed
of my actions.

132
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,418
Yeah.
Two "terribly"s?

133
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:55,047
It's to show contrition.
Well, I just wouldn't use that word.

134
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,092
I would never say
the word "terribly."

135
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,054
Phrase it however you want. Okay?
You're jumping ahead. Now--

136
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,557
And why--?
And why am I so ashamed?

137
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,727
Do I really need to answer that?

138
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:14,858
I was, and am,
providing for our family.

139
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:21,532
Let's just pick up where we left off.
I'm weak, I'm out of control.

140
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,283
This makes me look like crap.

141
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,120
This has to be
a warts-and-all story.

142
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,455
That's how we'll sell it.
We both look bad.

143
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,874
Oh-- How do you look bad exactly?

144
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,961
Where is the "I slept with my boss"
bullet point?

145
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,171
I can't seem to find that anywhere.

146
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,675
For a fired schoolteacher
who cooks crystal meth,

147
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,386
I'd say you're coming out
pretty much ahead.

148
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,931
I don't like it. I don't want
Junior thinking less of me.

149
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:51,145
At least you won at gambling.
I'm the bitch mom who wouldn't
cut you slack.

150
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,028
I'm sorry.

151
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,991
I'm sorry that
I put you through all of this.

152
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,872
How's that sound? Hm?

153
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,999
Here.

154
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,670
Two "sorry"s.

155
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,674
I believe we were
on page five.

156
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:26,305
So after you say
how very sorry you are,
in your own words, of course,

157
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,973
we're almost to the end.

158
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:32,352
And then I say
how proud I am of you for
joining a 12-step program.

159
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,150
And this is where
I think we should enact how
we're feeling, you know?

160
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:44,740
Just a suggestion.
You might look down
at the floor with remorse.

161
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:45,991
Hm?

162
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,872
What? You don't
have to mean it.

163
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,666
You just stare down
at your feet, Walt, okay?

164
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,919
Then I'm gonna--

165
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:02,382
I was thinking of taking Marie's hand
and saying something emotional like:

166
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,301
It's such a relief to tell you.

167
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,304
We're glad we have
a strong family to help us.

168
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:13,101
That we can all support each other.
And then maybe I'll tear up a little.

169
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,772
I don't know. We'll just have to see
what happens in the moment.

170
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,150
You're gonna cry on cue?

171
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,862
I said, I don't know. Maybe.
When you dab your eyes,

172
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,406
you gonna do it with
your right hand or your left?

173
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,785
One tear? Two tears? How many?
This has to be convincing.

174
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,080
Especially to Hank.
I'm doing the best I can here, Walt.

175
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,998
And yes, l'm thorough.

176
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:41,797
Maybe lying doesn't come
as easily to me as it does to you.

177
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,107
- Guys! Come on in! Hi!
- Hey.

178
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,483
Good to see you!
Hey.

179
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,570
- Hey, you little punk! Hey.
- Hey.

180
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,488
Great to see you.
How you doing?

181
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,283
Aw, look at my little princess.
She's getting big, huh?

182
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,536
- Yeah. And heavy too.
- Oh, is that actual food I'm smelling?

183
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,705
I might get an
honest-to-God meal here?

184
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,957
You look good.
Thank you, sweetheart.

185
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,252
Your Aunt Marie, she's cute,
but she could burn water.
Ha, ha, ha.

186
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,630
You are so hilarious.
Show the boys
your rock collection.

187
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,466
We're gonna get organized.
It'll be 20 minutes.

188
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,678
You have a rock collection?
It's a mineral collection.

189
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,972
Just something I've--
You wanna see it?

190
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,974
Sure.
All right. Let's go see it.

191
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,686
Ooh, hey, let me--
Hey, no. l-- l got it.

192
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,106
Come on, guys.
It's down the hall here.

193
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:48,864
- Now, that one there, that's rhodonite.
- Okay? lt's manganese inosilicate.

194
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,075
Cool. What makes it be
all pink like that?

195
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:56,371
Well, that's the manganese part.
Okay? lt oxidizes, you know,
like rust.

196
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,707
Manganese can have
an oxidation state

197
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,209
of between minus-three
and plus-seven,

198
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,963
which takes it through a range
of colors. Purple, green, blue.

199
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,925
But its most stable state is plus-two,
which is usually pale pink.

200
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,429
So...

201
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:20,395
Exactly. Whatever
the hell he said. Heh, heh.
Anyway, you, uh, get the idea.

202
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:26,401
- Yeah, it's interesting.
- Interesting stuff, that. Really.

203
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,490
Oh, hey. Uh...

204
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,075
Yeah, give me that.

205
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,911
Give me that file, will you?
You gotta check this out.

206
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,041
I've been working
on something here.
I'm doing a little consulting.

207
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,795
You know, weighing in
on a case for A.P.D.

208
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,175
Put that in for me.
Put that in over there.

209
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,886
Hank, what is this?
It's not a dead body--

210
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,597
Oh, no, no, no.
Nothing like that. No.

211
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,183
Seriously, you guys
you gotta check this out.

212
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,311
This is good. Ready?
Let me get it going here.

213
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,109

Walter H. White.

231
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,046
Man of hidden talents.

232
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:16,887
Dad, you're such a stud.
How much did you win exactly?

233
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,850
Dad?
I don't think I have exact figures.

234
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:27,189
It's enough to--
After taxes, of course,
to buy the car wash.

235
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,692
Maybe even pay for

236
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,987
a couple of halfway reasonable
college educations.

237
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:37,115
Damn, Dad, why'd you quit?

238
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:43,246
I can totally get a car
for my birthday now, right?

239
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:53,465
Son, l'm terribly, terribly
ashamed of my actions.

240
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:59,012
Would you excuse me, please?
I need to use the restroom.

241
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,145
Wow. Heh, heh.

242
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,378
Walt?

243
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,681
Hey.
Whoa, whoa.

244
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,516
Oh. Sorry.

245
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:49,312
Thought you might have fallen in.
No, no, l just, uh...

246
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,899
Hey, man, that was some
big stuff back there.

247
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,070
No, we wanted
to be thorough, so...

248
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,242
Yeah, well, it was quite
a tale. Couldn't have been
easy to, you know,

249
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,452
talk about.

250
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,623
You know, Walt, if you--

251
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:13,503
You can always bend my ear, right?
I mean, if you ever need to talk,

252
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:18,174
or just blow off some steam,
I'm here.

253
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,678
Not going anywhere, so...

254
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,848
Thanks, Hank.

255
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:33,773
Same goes for me, you know. If you
ever wanna bounce anything off me,

256
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,735
I don't know, casework,
anything, really.

257
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,322
Sometimes just talking
something through,

258
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,283
you know,
really can make a difference.

259
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:49,456
We're definitely not
talking bathtub crank here.
This is a big-ass operation.

260
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:52,334
You know, hundreds of pounds
a week. Maybe more.

261
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:59,633
So, um, who is this person?
What do you know about him?

262
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,427
Other than he's deader
than a Texas salad bar

263
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,429
and has a decent set of pipes?

264
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,933
I'd say he's my guy.
Your guy?

265
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:15,440
There's this mystery man I've been
chasing for the better part of a year.

266
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:21,029
Cooks the purest meth that me
or anyone else has ever seen.

267
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,991
Goes by the name of Heisenberg.

268
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,412
Hm.
Yeah. Pretty weird, huh?

269
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,667
I looked him up.
It was one of these physic--
One of Hitler's guys.

270
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,921
You know, a physicist
named Werner Heisenberg.
Heh, heh. Real cute, huh?

271
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,967
I figure with a handle like that,
my guy's gotta be some sort of--

272
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,844
Some sort of an egghead.
No offense.

273
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:49,641
And here we go.
Gale "Major Tom" Boetticher.

274
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,602
Anyway, I just wanna see
if l'm, you know,

275
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,064
not barking up the wrong tree,
chemically speaking.

276
00:21:56,232 --> 00:22:02,904
As far as I can make out, he's writing
about a phenylacetone cook, right?

277
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,450
Yeah.
Yeah. That's pretty rare these days,

278
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,829
but it does jibe with the blue stuff
I've been tracking.

279
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:15,333
"Two sticks dairy-free soy margarine,
two-third cup turbinado sugar."

280
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:22,966
It's a recipe for vegan s'mores.
Heh. There's all kinds
of crazy crap in there.

281
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,969
Yeah, like, you know,
top-ten recumbent bicycles,

282
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,762
indoor composting tips.

283
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:33,309
All right next to the mother
of methamphetamine syntheses.

284
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,231
This guy was a, uh...
Man, he was a real character.

285
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,609
Yeah, he seems unique.

286
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,446
Yeah. Let me show you something.
Give it here.

287
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,702
Right here at the, uh...
Right here at the top it says:

288
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:57,333
"To W.W. My star,
my perfect silence." Heh.

289
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,170
W.W. Heh, heh, heh.

290
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,756
I mean, who do you
figure that is, huh?

291
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,508
Woodrow Wilson?

292
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,845
Willy Wonka?

293
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,223
Walter White?

294
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,312
You got me.

295
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,358
W.W. Hm.

296
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,320
Wait a minute.
Let me see this...

297
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,865
for a second,
because l think I remembered...

298
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,659
Ah. Here.

299
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,828
Yes.

300
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,082
Yeah.

301
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,751
"When l Heard
the Learn'd Astronomer."

302
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,336
Learned.

303
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:47,425
And from time to time
Look'd up in perfect silence
At the stars

304
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:51,054
It's a poem by Walt Whitman.

305
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,598
Your W.W.

306
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,643
You freaking brainiac.

307
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,436
Ha. You freaking brainiac.

308
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,399
I must have skipped that day
in school or something. Heh, heh.

309
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,611
I been chasing my tail about
that one. Bet you're right.

310
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,781
Well, I'm glad I could be of help.
Yeah.

311
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,283
Walt Whitman. Huh.

312
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:18,206
So you think this Gale person
is your Heisenberg?

313
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,583
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

314
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,460
God, I wanted to get this guy.

315
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,840
It looks like you did.

316
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,468
No, I mean, you know,
me personally, you know?

317
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:34,806
I wanted to be the one to
slap the handcuffs on him,
that kind of shit.

318
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,685
Popeye Doyle waving to Frog One.

319
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:45,400
If I recall, at least from
the first French Connection,

320
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,154
Popeye Doyle never actually
caught him.

321
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,659
Yeah, I guess me
and old Popeye, huh?

322
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,203
Day late and a dollar short.

323
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,794
What about the person
who killed him?

324
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,463
A.P.D.'s problem, not mine.

325
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,382
Any leads?
My buddy Tim says

326
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,302
they got some fingerprints
they're trying to ID.

327
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,680
Eyewitness saw
a person of interest.
Might get lucky there.

328
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:19,475
Somebody knows something.
They'll track the shooter eventually.

Would you stop doing
what you're doing, please?

I'm not done, yo.
And that dude's next.

351
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:32,298
What the hell? What is wrong--?
We have business to discuss.

352
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,801
So discuss. Jesus.

353
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,386
Let go of me.

354
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,180
Gale's murder
is being investigated.

355
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,807
Uh, duh.

356
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:45,311
And I have it on good
authority that they found
fingerprints at the scene.

357
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:47,397
Not mine.

358
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,818
We done here?
No, we are not done here.

359
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:54,612
What if they are yours?
How can you be so sure?

360
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:58,533
Because l'm here.
Your brother-in-law's
got such a hard-on for me,

361
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,952
if the cops found my fingerprints--
Shh.

362
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,622
If the cops found my prints
within five blocks of that place,

363
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,041
they would've picked me up
by now.

364
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,377
What about the casing?

365
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,587
Oh, my God.
Or casings?

366
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,632
How many times
did you shoot him, anyway?

367
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,721
Jesse, did you pick up
the casings?

368
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,432
Did you pick them up?

369
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,683
No.

370
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,812
Yeah, well...

371
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:33,192
Listen, we gotta go over this
step-by-step, everything.

372
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,612
Tell me exactly what happened
from the moment you got there.

373
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,948
I got in, l got out.
No.

374
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:42,869
No, I need to know specifics.
Now, we'll start from the beginning.

375
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:47,915
You drove there.
You drove over there.
You went to his door, right?

376
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,586
Jesse, l need you to concentrate.

377
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,422
This is very important.
Did you knock or ring?

378
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,300
Knock or ring?
Unh!

379
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,801
Knock.

380
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,221
Good, good.
That's very good.
Now, listen.

381
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:05,892
Assume that Gale answered the door.
What happened after that?

382
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,435
Did he recognize you?

383
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,771
Did you say anything
to each other?

384
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,900
Did you walk into the room
or did you shoot him
right then and there?

385
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,401
What?

386
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,739
- Who wants to make a hundred bucks?
- Yeah.

387
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:20,948
Huh?

388
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,801
Look, the kid's probably right.

389
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,721
If they had anything on him,
he'd be locked up already.

390
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,516
What about my brother-in-law?
He suspects Jess--

391
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:51,229
Hell, he knows Jesse is involved
in the sale of blue meth.

392
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:56,609
That was Hank's one-and-only lead.
What if he puts two and two together

393
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,070
and he goes after Jesse
for the murder?

394
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,407
Goes after him how,
on his Rascal scooter? Ha, ha.

395
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:07,161
Ahem. That perhaps
sounded insensitive. Uh...

396
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:11,499
But if he goes after him,
I'll sue his ass for police brutality,

397
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,043
harassment, assault
and 1 6 other things.

398
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,755
No, history those two
have together, being what it is,

399
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:22,218
gotta figure your brother-in-law's
smart enough not to go down
that road.

400
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:26,264
Goose egg. Bubkes.
That's what the cops got.

401
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,558
I wouldn't worry about it.
Ugh.

402
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,853
Yeah, what else should I
not worry about, Saul? Hm?

403
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,107
Should I not worry that
Gus plans to murder me
at the first chance he gets?

404
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:40,987
That my drug-addicted partner
doesn't seem to care whether
he lives or dies?

405
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:46,200
You should see his house.
It's like skid row.

406
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,370
He has actual hobos
living there.

407
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,040
Now, how long before Gus decides
that he's too big of a risk?

408
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:58,212
Jeez, l got Mike,
that grunting, dead-eyed cretin

409
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:02,967
sucker-punching me in the face.
I've got Gus wielding a box cutter.

410
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:07,930
I mean, Western Union,
message received.

411
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:15,104
Let me ask you. When did this
stop being a business? Hm?

412
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:20,193
Why am l the only person capable of
behaving in a professional manner?

413
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:28,075
No, any way you slice it,
everyone is in danger.

414
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,871
I mean, how can l protect anyone?

415
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,749
My family, Jesse, myself?

416
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:39,545
My name never comes up
with those guys, does it?

417
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:45,801
And meanwhile, we're buying
this stupid car wash.

418
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:51,224
Oh, yeah. That ship
has sailed, bon voyage.

419
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,558
We are committed.

420
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,644
We already told
our family about it.

421
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,438
And now Skyler,
I'm sure she believes--

422
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:02,193
She needs to believe
that everything is neat and tidy.

423
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:06,280
And she's telling herself that
I work in this nice, quiet little lab

424
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,158
with a white lab coat
and a pocket protector

425
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,870
and when my contract is up,
I'll just simply hang it all up,

426
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,081
tip my hat and walk away.

427
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:21,170
Oh, God.

428
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,465
How did everything
get so screwed up?

429
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,971
Yeah, you do have a little
shit-creek action happening.

430
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:42,692
You know, FYl,
you can buy a paddle.

431
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,989
This is a last-resort,
back-pocket kind of thing,

432
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,992
but if you really gotta
protect yourself, uh,

433
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,827
disappear...

434
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:57,707
Poof.

435
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,959
There's a guy who can
make it happen.

436
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:04,088
They call him a,
uh, "dissapearer."

437
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,842
For a substantial fee,
and I do mean substantial,

438
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:12,096
you and your loved ones
can vanish. Untraceable.

439
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:14,974
I mean, he sets you up
with a whole new life.

440
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:20,187
What, like a witness protection
kind of thing?

441
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,690
Beyond. I mean, off the grid.

442
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:27,361
New identities, new everything.
No one would ever be able
to trace you.

443
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:31,532
Now, be clear.
This is an end game,
if you get my meaning.

444
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,118
I mean, there's no coming back.

445
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,375
So you want his card?

446
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,217
God, there's gotta be
something else that I can do.

447
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,764
Some way to keep everything
from spiraling out of control.

448
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,599
Well, from what you told me,

449
00:32:56,767 --> 00:33:00,895
it sounds like Pinkman is first up
in the imminent-demise department.

450
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:07,360
Gus won't risk
letting the police find Jesse.

451
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,945
I know him. He won't.

452
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:35,471
l'm not kidding.
If you really think about it,
you can't even see it.

453
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,724
How can you know how bad
radio frequencies, microwaves,

454
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,810
and cell phones are getting you?

455
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,397
You could be strolling
through security at the airport--

456
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,606
Hey, wake up, bitches.

457
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,193
You get waved through
a x-ray scanner.

458
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:53,447
Next day, you could be dead or dying
from all the radiation they say is safe.

459
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:57,451
But there's no way it could be.
It has to deliver a concentrated dose.

460
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,161
Enough to penetrate clothes.

461
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:03,207
The accumulated amount could be
dangerous to susceptible individuals,

462
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,584
especially from a rural area.
Hey, yo.

463
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,879
The ozone layer is already thin
because of the cow farts.

464
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,339
Yo!

465
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:11,549
Oh, hey.

466
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,135
Make sure there's pizza here
when l get back.

467
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,929
All right? Enough for everybody.
Oh. Oh, yeah.

468
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,849
I can do that.
I can definitely do that.

469
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,185
Not a problem.
I can get the stuff,
the pizza and stuff.

470
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,480
But as far as the financial situation,
you know...

471
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:35,156
Just hang on. Hang on.
Yeah, yeah.

472
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,200
And you know,
the concentrated doses,

473
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:42,872
it's gonna fuck
with your bone marrow
and it's gonna mess up...

474
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,387
Because-- Because especially
if you have cancer.

475
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:01,932
You know, because if you gotta
get a bone-marrow transplant,

476
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,644
your odds are 60 percent.
You got a 60 percent chan--

477
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,354
Hey.

478
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,023
Oh.

479
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,194
- Hey, hey.
- Huh?

480
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,904
Get some dipping sticks too, yo.

481
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,948
Yeah, I can definitely get
dipping sticks.

482
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,285
All right. I can get them.

Nope.
You ought to.

502
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:52,079
He's been at your house
for three solid days.

503
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,497
Okay.

504
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,457
He stole your money.

505
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,459
Okay.

506
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:02,214
That $78,000 or so
look familiar?

That's it.

508
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,556
Okay. Thanks.

509
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:17,813
Wanna know what's next for
Little Miss Pissed-in-His-Pants?

510
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,690
No.
You sure, now?

511
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:24,236
- Yep.
- Don't even wanna take a wild guess?

512
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,407
You're gonna kill him.

513
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,328
Is this the part where
I'm supposed to beg you
not to do it?

514
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,998
Oh, please, please.

515
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,000
And then what?

516
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,420
I'm supposed to promise,
cross my heart,

517
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,423
to straighten up and fly right
or toe the line,

518
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,092
or some other crap
that I'm not gonna say?

519
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,471
Is that what your little show
here was all about?

520
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:55,976
You're on thin ice,
you little shithead.
You know that?

521
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,482
You ain't gonna smoke
that dude in there.

522
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,358
You know how come I know?

523
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,613
Because you went through the trouble
of putting a blindfold on him.

524
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,786
I'm going back to bed.

525
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,205
Let yourselves out.

526
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,635
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

527
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,306
How's the ear?
Mending.

528
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,190
What can l do for you?

529
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,025
It's Pinkman.

530
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,528
He's become
increasingly incautious.

531
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,823
He's a risk. A liability.

532
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:55,494
I know he and Walter come as a team
and that Walter won't like it,

533
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,539
but something's gotta be done.

534
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,117
You gotta be kidding.

535
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,544
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

536
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,507
Right.
This is message number three.

537
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:55,137
You'd better be ready in two minutes,
because l am right outside your door.

538
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:04,813
Jesse!

539
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,903
Damn it.

540
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,035
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

541
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,578
Oh, great.

542
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,958
Jesse!

543
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,835
Oh. This is perfect.

544
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,213
You are a piece of work,
you know that?

545
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:43,727
Jesse?

546
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:47,981
Jesse.

547
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,153
Jesse?

548
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,808
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

549
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,292
Where is he?

550
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,397
Gonna ask where we're going?

551
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:13,775
Nope.
