1
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:39,533
All right, everybody. Listen up.

2
00:01:39,742 --> 00:01:44,288
Tuco Salamanca. For those of you
who were not with us this morning...

3
00:01:44,497 --> 00:01:46,665
...we raided his headquarters.

4
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,709
Also his last-known address.

5
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:53,005
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth-hag girlfriend.

6
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:56,801
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
The man himself smelled us coming.

7
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,639
So study the face. Study the file.

8
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:04,225
Get a big old raging hard-on...

9
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:07,728
...at the idea
of catching this piece of shit.

10
00:02:08,604 --> 00:02:10,648
My apologies
to the H.R. department.

11
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:14,693
Grow tumescent with anticipation.

12
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,445
All right.

13
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:18,572
On the hit parade, 1998.

14
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:20,741
Reputed to have whacked
one "Dog" Paulson...

15
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,828
...back when our bandidos
were wresting the crank trade away...

16
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:25,579
...from the SoCal biker gangs.

17
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:29,208
Also, we're pretty sure
he knifed a Mexican national in '03.

18
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:33,045
And for my money, seeing
how he customarily deals with rivals...

19
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,881
...I'd say he is a prime suspect
in the disappearance...

20
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,342
...of our dearly missed Krazy-8.

21
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:41,512
Hats over your heart for that dirtball.

22
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,722
We hauled Tuco in
for questioning on that...

23
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,433
...but we couldn't make it stick.

24
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:48,227
Yeah, he runs a tight ship.
Smug bastard.

25
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:52,356
And even worse, El Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

26
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:55,776
Yeah, yeah. I know. We all know
what's going on down there.

27
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:57,778
We sure don't want it going on
up here...

28
00:02:57,987 --> 00:02:59,780
...which brings us to the good news.

29
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:04,493
We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

30
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:08,581
This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
Street name: No-Doze.

31
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:12,293
Found him tucked in the junkyard
along with Tuco's own brother-in-law...

32
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:14,128
...a.k.a. Gonzo.

33
00:03:14,336 --> 00:03:18,799
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,
was moving No-Doze's body--

34
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:21,385
Either hiding it there
or pulling it out. Not sure.

35
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:25,055
--when he got his arm crushed
clean off.

36
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:28,309
Anyone wanna see the photos,
they're on my website. Hilarious.

37
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:30,478
Anyway. The upshot is...

38
00:03:30,686 --> 00:03:36,025
...we got us a nice, big, juicy,
bloody fingerprint...

39
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:39,653
...which belongs to Señor Tuco.

40
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:43,449
Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

41
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:47,119
That is, provided we find this guy.

42
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,623
So to all present, I ask you,
you wanna find this guy?

43
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,334
- Yes.
- Yes.

44
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:54,960
What the hell was that? Jesus.

45
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:57,671
Wanna try that again?

46
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,091
- Do you wanna find this guy?
- Yes!

47
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,844
- Are we going to find this guy?
- Yes!

48
00:04:04,053 --> 00:04:05,346
- Louder, damn it!
- Yes!

49
00:04:05,554 --> 00:04:07,473
- Give me a "hell, yeah!"
- Hell, yeah!

50
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,391
- Hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

51
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,104
<i>Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah, Hell, yeah.</i>

52
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,193
They ain't gonna find him.

53
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:21,612
<i>Guy is in México by now.</i>

54
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:24,824
Appearances, Gomey.
It's all about appearances.

55
00:04:27,576 --> 00:04:29,370
Listen, I gotta take
some personal time.

56
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:31,288
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

57
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:36,043
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's missing.

58
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:39,380
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

59
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:42,550
Damn. You don't think he...?

60
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:46,137
Holler if you need me.

61
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:49,223
All right. Thanks a lot, man.
Appreciate that.

62
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:05,466
This is the most recent photo.
We haven't taken many lately, so...

63
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:09,804
But that's what he looks like now.

64
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:12,348
Without the hair.

65
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:16,268
Hey, it's me.

66
00:06:16,852 --> 00:06:19,980
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate you
sparing us your day off.

67
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:22,608
No worries. Happy to help.

68
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:25,069
Yeah, this is helpful. Good.

69
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:27,655
- What about height and weight?
- Five eleven...

70
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:29,990
...most recently, about 170.

71
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:34,620
One sixty-five. That's what I weigh.

72
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:37,665
I guess he weighs a little less.

73
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:41,127
That's fine.
That's close enough. Good.

74
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,671
What about
other distinguishing features?

75
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,173
Tattoos or moles or scars?

76
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:51,428
- Anything that might help us.
- Tattoos? No. Not really. No.

77
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:53,431
That's fine.

78
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,474
- Is that the list of medications?
- Yes.

79
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:58,185
I wrote them all down.
And there's no drug interactions.

80
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:02,106
None that are listed.
I called his doctor, so, no.

81
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,817
Has he been depressed?

82
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:14,785
He's been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

83
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:16,704
Yeah.

84
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:21,208
Last night, he was agitated.

85
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:22,543
Agitated?

86
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:27,214
Yeah. When he came home last night,
he was agitated, upset.

87
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:31,135
Upset in general? Or upset
because of something particular?

88
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:39,894
When I asked him what was wrong,
he said:

89
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:42,646
"I don't know where to begin."

90
00:07:44,023 --> 00:07:46,734
Then he just walked out of the room--
Out of the bathroom.

91
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:48,569
I was in the tub, taking a bath.

92
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:51,822
--and when I came out
about 10 minutes later, he was gone.

93
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:54,617
Nothing else missing?

94
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,830
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

95
00:08:00,372 --> 00:08:03,709
But-- What about the phone call?

96
00:08:06,212 --> 00:08:07,254
I'm looking into it.

97
00:08:07,963 --> 00:08:11,383
- What phone call?
- Walt's cell phone rang.

98
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:15,930
He pulled it out, looked at it,
and didn't answer it.

99
00:08:16,138 --> 00:08:19,767
But then, a short time after,
he wandered out of the bathroom.

100
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:21,769
I mean...

101
00:08:21,977 --> 00:08:23,813
...couldn't that be...

102
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:25,898
...important, right?

103
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:31,529
Anything else you can think of?

104
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,281
Anything else.

105
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,617
No. I called
the credit card providers...

106
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:41,956
...and there's no report
of any recent activity.

107
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:46,502
I-- Let's see. I checked
with every hospital within 50 miles.

108
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,796
Every police station. Every morgue.

109
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:51,674
So, no, I really don't--
I don't have anything else.

110
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:55,386
I was actually hoping
that you had something else...

111
00:08:55,594 --> 00:08:58,097
...being that you're the expert.

112
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:03,936
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:05,479
No worries.

114
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:09,442
I think this is good enough to start.
Gives us plenty to work on.

115
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:14,155
- Mrs. White.
- Thank you.

116
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:16,782
- Walter.
- Thank you.

117
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,837
So that cell-phone call
she's talking about? I ran it.

118
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:31,964
- And?
- Never happened.

119
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:33,632
No record of it.

120
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,135
- Second cell phone.
- Yeah. I'm thinking.

121
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:17,653
I understand.

122
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:21,449
Out.

123
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:23,617
Get away from me!

124
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:28,789
Settle down, bitch.

125
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:33,294
You gonna shoot me, huh?
Shoot me in here!

126
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:35,796
I hope I bleed like a mother too!

127
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:38,048
That way, you have to clean it up!

128
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:43,429
It's your ride, retard.

129
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:45,556
I ain't gotta clean jack. Now, get out.

130
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:57,777
Get up.

131
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:00,321
Get up.

132
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:11,040
Oh, my God.

133
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:13,334
Don't do this, Tuco.

134
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:40,087
No more posters?

135
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:43,382
Walter Jr.'s making more.

136
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:49,096
Thank you, Marie.

137
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:55,686
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

138
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:59,440
I mean, he just doesn't strike me
as the type.

139
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:01,275
He'll turn up.

140
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:13,621
Okay, the whole tiara thing...

141
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:17,374
- ...I just find it bewildering that...
- Marie.

142
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,461
- ...you didn't believe that--
- Marie.

143
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:24,131
Not now.

144
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,059
Empty your pockets.

145
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:30,257
Thought your name was
Heisenberg...

146
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:33,260
..."Walter Hartwell White."

147
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:36,680
Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.

148
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:41,435
You know, a business name.

149
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:50,069
Yeah.

150
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:57,993
I like doing business
with a family man.

151
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,788
There's always a lot of collateral.

152
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,534
Answer me one thing.

153
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:43,205
Can I trust you?

154
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:47,668
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

155
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,430
Sit down.

156
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,065
DEA...

157
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:14,528
...hit my place of business
this morning.

158
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:16,947
About a hundred cops
looking for me.

159
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:21,660
- You two haven't been talking, right?
- No.

160
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,287
No.

161
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:28,375
Picked up my whole crew,
top to bottom.

162
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:31,629
Everybody except Gonzo.

163
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:33,881
That's weird, right?

164
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:37,551
I mean, don't you think
that that's weird?

165
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,471
It's weird. Yes.

166
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,056
Unusual.

167
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:44,642
Unusual.

168
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:50,564
Last two days,
I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.

169
00:18:51,857 --> 00:18:55,069
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No-Doze.

170
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:58,781
Explain to me.

171
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:04,078
How is it my fault that that little
bitch did not know his place?

172
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,920
I saw this coming.

173
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:16,715
I can see the future, you know?

174
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:21,595
It's this gift that I have
deep inside my head.

175
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:26,225
I knew last night they were gonna
come try and bust me.

176
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:27,935
Gonzo.

177
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:35,526
He went and snitched to the cops!
That lousy son of a bitch!

178
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:42,450
I trusted him like a brother!
I was good to him! I was good!

179
00:19:42,658 --> 00:19:46,245
I see Gonzo, I'm gonna gut him,
I'm gonna skin him...

180
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:49,957
...and I'm gonna stuff his hide
for a heavy bag...

181
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:54,295
...and every time I hit him,
it's gonna be like a lesson to myself!

182
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:58,549
You never,
never trust the people that you love!

183
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:10,770
So you plan to ice Gonzo,
like, future tense?

184
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:12,897
What?

185
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:16,233
You're saying, Tuco...

186
00:20:16,442 --> 00:20:19,236
You're saying that Gonzo...

187
00:20:19,445 --> 00:20:23,741
...is currently operating
as a police informant...

188
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:25,159
...as far as you know?

189
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,831
I'm very sorry to hear that.

190
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,876
That's disappointing.

191
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:35,503
Yeah.

192
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,672
- I'd waste him too, yo.
- Shut up.

193
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:40,257
Okay.

194
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:43,344
They're out there looking for me
right now.

195
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:46,347
They got ghetto birds
and black ops.

196
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:50,684
I need to get high.
I need to get good and high.

197
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:58,651
What's with this gak?
It smells like headcheese.

198
00:20:59,443 --> 00:21:02,905
No, it's-- It's killer.

199
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:04,657
Yeah, seriously.

200
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:12,206
So I was thinking last night.

201
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:14,041
I came up with this great idea.

202
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:22,967
- Mexico?
- We'll disappear way out in the jungle.

203
00:21:23,175 --> 00:21:24,927
We'll set you up in a superlab.

204
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:27,638
We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.

205
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:29,723
And no Federales
are gonna mess with us...

206
00:21:29,932 --> 00:21:32,143
...because I got my people there.

207
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:34,145
Connections.

208
00:21:34,812 --> 00:21:38,566
We're going to make beaucoup bucks,
Heisenberg, huh?

209
00:21:38,774 --> 00:21:40,860
Tuco, I...

210
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,696
I have a wife and family.

211
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:47,074
So what? You'll get another one.

212
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:51,328
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, but I can't just...

213
00:21:51,537 --> 00:21:53,914
...uproot my life like that.

214
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:56,083
Yeah, man. I mean, me neither.

215
00:21:59,128 --> 00:22:00,838
Who's talking to you?

216
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:07,219
You need me, man...

217
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:10,598
...because I cooked that scante
in your hands.

218
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:14,935
Yeah.

219
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:16,729
I'll tell you something, yo.

220
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:19,774
You never tried nothing like it.

221
00:22:19,982 --> 00:22:22,109
Stink or no stink...

222
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:26,781
...one bump,
you'll be flying high for days.

223
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:32,453
It's a new product him
and I've been working up.

224
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:34,997
Careful when you hit it.

225
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:38,042
It kicks like a 12 gauge
when it comes on.

226
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:43,631
It's got a secret ingredient.

227
00:22:45,925 --> 00:22:47,426
What secret ingredient?

228
00:22:48,552 --> 00:22:50,429
Chilli powder.

229
00:22:57,686 --> 00:22:59,063
I hate chilli powder.

230
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:06,112
This blue magic, this is money.

231
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:10,407
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.

232
00:23:15,204 --> 00:23:17,832
We're gonna rewrite history
with this.

233
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:26,006
All right. Time to clean the menudo
out from between your ears.

234
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:30,136
No, no, no. No, I need him, Tuco.

235
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:32,346
I need him very, very badly.

236
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:35,850
He's my partner.

237
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:41,147
And if he doesn't go, I don't go.

238
00:23:43,357 --> 00:23:46,527
I'll tell you this. My cousins
are driving up here right now...

239
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:49,530
...to smuggle us back,
and they're gonna be here by sunset...

240
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:53,200
...and you're gonna be on that truck,
or you're gonna be dead!

241
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,745
And you...

242
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,958
You better hope they got room
in the trunk.

243
00:24:16,557 --> 00:24:20,561
- Where are you going?
- Louis is taking me to the train station.

244
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,521
We'll put these up.

245
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,734
- No, no, honey. No, I'll do it.
- He wants to help, let him help.

246
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:30,362
I mean, how long has it been
since you've slept?

247
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:34,658
Yeah, she's right, Sky.
Why don't you lay down a while?

248
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:38,329
For chrissake,
you got a bun in the oven.

249
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:40,831
I got my cell if you need me.

250
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,125
- Okay?
- Okay.

251
00:24:44,543 --> 00:24:48,214
- Bye, sweetie. I'll see you later.
- All right. Bye.

252
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:55,638
Actually, I think the very fact
they haven't found him yet...

253
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:57,681
...bodes well.

254
00:24:58,808 --> 00:25:03,145
Well, I mean, if he-- You know.

255
00:25:04,188 --> 00:25:07,233
Somebody would've
smelled something by now.

256
00:25:07,983 --> 00:25:10,027
There's got to be something.

257
00:25:10,236 --> 00:25:12,113
Some detail
that we haven't picked up on.

258
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:16,700
- What about the second cell phone?
- Jesus.

259
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:20,538
What? We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

260
00:25:21,997 --> 00:25:24,041
Okay. What are you talking about?

261
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,466
The call you said Walt got
before he disappeared?

262
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:34,969
There's no record of it
with the phone company.

263
00:25:35,678 --> 00:25:37,930
No incoming,
no dropped calls, nothing.

264
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:40,182
But his phone rang. I heard it.

265
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:46,605
All right. Well, then if that's the case,
he must have a second phone.

266
00:25:48,858 --> 00:25:51,402
Why? What sense would there be
in that?

267
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,655
Yeah. All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

268
00:25:57,199 --> 00:26:00,411
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
secret cell phone and then drop it.

269
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:02,663
What does it mean?

270
00:26:02,872 --> 00:26:04,999
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

271
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:09,336
It means Walt has a secret.

272
00:26:09,545 --> 00:26:13,382
Everyone's got one from somebody,
big or little.

273
00:26:14,383 --> 00:26:18,512
- Okay. Everyone. Okay.
- Skyler, come on.

274
00:26:18,721 --> 00:26:22,641
He kept cancer from you for weeks.

275
00:26:24,435 --> 00:26:28,481
Okay, then, let's assume
there's a second cell phone.

276
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:31,108
So what?
What, is he having an affair?

277
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:33,652
Walt? Please.

278
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:43,662
- What about the marijuana?
- He's not on pot anymore.

279
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:45,873
Says who? Him?

280
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:48,209
Chemotherapy
and marijuana go together...

281
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:52,338
...like apple pie and Chevrolet.

282
00:26:52,546 --> 00:26:57,218
Maybe he's addicted to the pot...

283
00:26:57,426 --> 00:26:59,470
...and he owes his drug dealer
a lot of money.

284
00:26:59,678 --> 00:27:02,765
Marie, you don't get hooked on pot
like that.

285
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:05,935
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

286
00:27:07,311 --> 00:27:10,898
Hank, you have to question
this drug-dealer person.

287
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:12,691
He may know something.

288
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:21,909
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

289
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:25,913
Then grasp.

290
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:37,425
Excuse me, ma'am.

291
00:27:38,384 --> 00:27:41,512
Hi, I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

292
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:44,098
No. I'm afraid not.

293
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:47,226
- Why?
- I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

294
00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:51,856
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

295
00:27:52,064 --> 00:27:55,276
He taught your son chemistry
in high school.

296
00:27:55,484 --> 00:27:58,821
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

297
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:01,657
- That was a long time ago.
- Yes, ma'am.

298
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:05,536
It's my understanding that he
and Jesse, they've stayed in touch.

299
00:28:06,495 --> 00:28:08,664
- Really?
- Yeah.

300
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:14,253
Mr. White must've seen
some potential in Jesse.

301
00:28:14,462 --> 00:28:16,797
He really tried to motivate him.

302
00:28:17,006 --> 00:28:19,383
He was one of the few teachers
who cared.

303
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:21,385
Yeah, Walt's that way.
He's a good man.

304
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:24,138
I'm so sorry
to hear about his illness.

305
00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:25,973
Please pass along our best wishes.

306
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:29,518
I certainly will,
as soon as he turns up.

307
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:30,936
He's missing, actually.

308
00:28:31,896 --> 00:28:33,397
Just kind of walked off, or...

309
00:28:34,774 --> 00:28:36,901
Anyway, which is why
I'm going around...

310
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:39,737
...trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

311
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:41,655
That's terrible.

312
00:28:41,864 --> 00:28:44,158
Anything we can do to help.

313
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:47,328
Well, if you could put me in touch
with your son...

314
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:50,581
Like I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

315
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,835
Jesse's not answering either number,
and no one seems to be at his house.

316
00:28:55,044 --> 00:28:59,173
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

317
00:29:00,424 --> 00:29:03,344
I don't necessarily. I just--

318
00:29:03,552 --> 00:29:05,763
- Are you with the police?
- No, ma'am. Not at all.

319
00:29:08,891 --> 00:29:13,145
I'm with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

320
00:29:13,562 --> 00:29:14,897
Oh, my God.

321
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:16,190
Is my son in trouble?

322
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:18,859
I have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

323
00:29:19,068 --> 00:29:21,570
Do I need to get a lawyer?

324
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:24,365
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this...

325
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:26,992
...coming here and asking questions
about my son and--

326
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:29,620
Mrs. Pinkman,
I'm not here on official capacity.

327
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:33,499
I do not care what your son may
or may not have done wrong.

328
00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:35,459
I just wanna find my brother-in-law.

329
00:29:36,544 --> 00:29:40,714
His wife is worried sick,
and she's got a baby on the way.

330
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:44,760
I'm sorry. I would like to help you...

331
00:29:44,969 --> 00:29:47,471
...but I have not seen my son
in over a month.

332
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,058
I don't expect to see him
anytime soon.

333
00:29:52,393 --> 00:29:55,980
Well, thanks for your time.

334
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:02,236
If you could tell me one more thing.

335
00:30:02,445 --> 00:30:06,824
Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy
Monte Carlo, as far as you know?

336
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,455
If he had spent half as much time
and money on his education...

337
00:30:12,663 --> 00:30:16,876
...as he has
on that ridiculous bouncing car...

338
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:20,254
Low rider, huh?

339
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,048
Gomey, hey.

340
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:26,093
No, nothing yet. Hey, listen,
do me a solid and check out...

341
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:28,387
...a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo...

342
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:33,017
...registered to a one
Jesse Pinkman.

343
00:30:33,225 --> 00:30:36,353
Specifically, I wanna know
if the car's got a LoJack.

344
00:30:36,562 --> 00:30:40,107
It's one of those jack-off low riders,
so I'm betting there is.

345
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:43,652
If so, can you go ahead
and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

346
00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:12,598
Chilli powder.

347
00:31:13,015 --> 00:31:16,644
Did I not already tell you
how moronic that was?

348
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:18,187
Whatever, man.

349
00:31:18,395 --> 00:31:20,147
At least I tried something.

350
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:22,274
Hey, it almost worked too.

351
00:31:22,483 --> 00:31:25,569
How's about
you leaving my gun, huh?

352
00:31:25,778 --> 00:31:28,614
First you boost it,
then you leave it in your house.

353
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:30,491
My gun.

354
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:37,331
How was I supposed to know you were
chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?

355
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,709
Well, at least he wants you alive.

356
00:32:15,244 --> 00:32:16,537
Hey, I don't get it.

357
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:19,748
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo,
then who did?

358
00:32:19,957 --> 00:32:21,667
I don't know.

359
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:24,211
I don't know.

360
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:27,506
Does it really matter?

361
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:31,677
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead
and not a police informant...

362
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:33,971
...who does he
automatically blame?

363
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,015
Us.

364
00:32:38,768 --> 00:32:40,394
We need a plan.

365
00:32:42,605 --> 00:32:45,900
- Think, think.
- Let's just bum-rush him, man.

366
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:48,360
You crack him over
the head with something...

367
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:50,613
...and I'll go for his gun.

368
00:32:55,201 --> 00:32:58,204
Crack him over the head
with something?

369
00:33:01,373 --> 00:33:04,084
Hey, you got the C-bomb, man,
all right?

370
00:33:04,293 --> 00:33:05,961
You're as good
as checked out already.

371
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:10,257
Okay? You should be, like, all
sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.

372
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:11,884
Just...

373
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:17,014
Oh, so my life
is not the priority here...

374
00:33:17,223 --> 00:33:19,767
...because I'm gonna be
dead soon anyway.

375
00:33:19,975 --> 00:33:21,769
That's your point?

376
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:23,979
Yeah.

377
00:33:51,674 --> 00:33:54,677
We gotta get him to take this.

378
00:33:54,885 --> 00:33:57,263
Well, he don't much like
the taste of chilli P.

379
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,306
That much has been established.

380
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:02,476
So unless you can convince him
to booty bump...

381
00:34:07,857 --> 00:34:11,444
Eat. We got a long ride ahead of us.

382
00:34:29,628 --> 00:34:32,256
Go on, sit. You're looking
a little weak, Heisenberg.

383
00:34:32,465 --> 00:34:35,718
I don't want you to go belly up
before we get there.

384
00:35:15,257 --> 00:35:17,051
<i>Take it easy, Tio.</i>

385
00:35:17,593 --> 00:35:21,555
I will feed you.
I eat first. That's the deal.

386
00:35:29,563 --> 00:35:31,232
What?

387
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:40,908
I get it, I get it, I get it.

388
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:45,329
Oh, you greedy old bastard.

389
00:35:45,538 --> 00:35:47,748
I tell you, Heisenberg.

390
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:50,918
Old people.

391
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:53,754
You feed them, huh?

392
00:35:53,963 --> 00:35:56,590
You put them in a really nice crib
in the country...

393
00:35:56,799 --> 00:36:00,177
...and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

394
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:03,639
You better eat every bite of that.

395
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:29,623
What did you do that for?

396
00:36:29,832 --> 00:36:31,750
God!

397
00:37:16,045 --> 00:37:18,339
Hey, look. Look.

398
00:37:18,547 --> 00:37:20,174
There's nothing left.

399
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:50,246
What? What do you want?

400
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,920
No.

401
00:37:58,129 --> 00:38:01,382
Don't even tell me
that you're hungry.

402
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,842
Don't go there.

403
00:38:16,188 --> 00:38:18,149
<i>Are you mad-dogging them, Tio?</i>

404
00:38:20,276 --> 00:38:23,070
What, you don't like them?

405
00:38:25,364 --> 00:38:26,407
One ding.

406
00:38:26,615 --> 00:38:29,994
<i>That means yes. Tio don't like you.</i>

407
00:38:34,457 --> 00:38:37,084
<i>Why don't you like them, Tio?</i>

408
00:38:40,337 --> 00:38:42,423
You don't trust them?

409
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:54,435
<i>- Why don't you trust them, Tio?
- Tuco, come on. He's...</i>

410
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:58,606
There clearly some dementia.
He's not lucid.

411
00:39:11,994 --> 00:39:13,788
<i>Did they do something to you, Tio?</i>

412
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,251
Something that you don't like?

413
00:39:26,342 --> 00:39:30,304
<i>What did they do to you?
What did you do to my tio?</i>

414
00:39:30,513 --> 00:39:31,806
Nothing. Nothing.

415
00:39:32,014 --> 00:39:36,811
<i>- Bullshit! My tio does not lie!
- I don't know. I swear. I don't know.</i>

416
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:41,816
No, I-- Maybe it was-- I did change
the channel on his TV, but...

417
00:39:42,024 --> 00:39:44,276
Yeah, that's it.
While you were cooking...

418
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:47,988
...he was watching
one of those telenovels...

419
00:39:48,197 --> 00:39:50,825
...with all those ripe honeys on it.
He was really into it.

420
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:52,701
I told you
not to change the channel.

421
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,913
You know, dude needs his eye candy.
That's it.

422
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:05,548
<i>Is that it, Tio?</i>

423
00:40:06,048 --> 00:40:08,175
<i>Is that it, Tio?</i>

424
00:40:09,885 --> 00:40:11,303
Did they change your mamitas?

425
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:22,606
<i>What are you telling me, Tio?</i>

426
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:26,694
Are they punking me?

427
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:44,503
Hey. No.

428
00:40:44,712 --> 00:40:48,132
No, man. No.

429
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,800
- Come here!
- No.

430
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:53,554
No, no, Tuco.

431
00:41:00,394 --> 00:41:03,397
Tuco, no. Tuco.

432
00:41:07,777 --> 00:41:09,570
Shut up!

433
00:41:21,624 --> 00:41:25,544
No. Please, no. God. Please, no.

434
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:28,255
No, God. I don't wanna die.

435
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:30,424
Tell me what you did, Walter!

436
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:33,928
Jesus, I don't wanna die.

437
00:41:34,637 --> 00:41:37,890
- No!
- Tell me what you did!

438
00:41:43,646 --> 00:41:45,981
We tried to poison you.

439
00:41:47,566 --> 00:41:49,693
We tried to poison you...

440
00:41:51,487 --> 00:41:55,616
...because you're an insane,
degenerate piece of filth...

441
00:41:55,825 --> 00:41:57,785
...and you deserve to die.

442
00:42:40,578 --> 00:42:42,621
Who's the bitch now?

443
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,102
Let him bleed.

444
00:43:24,038 --> 00:43:25,706
The keys.

445
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:28,292
Tuco.

446
00:43:29,085 --> 00:43:30,753
Oh, my God.

447
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,215
The cousins?

448
00:44:31,147 --> 00:44:32,440
What the hell is going on?

449
00:44:44,243 --> 00:44:46,120
Jesse Pinkman.

450
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:49,081
You're a hard man to find.

451
00:44:57,173 --> 00:44:59,508
Oh, shit.

452
00:45:10,853 --> 00:45:12,480
Easy.

453
00:46:29,306 --> 00:46:31,475
Oh, my God.

454
00:46:33,436 --> 00:46:36,605
Oh, God. Hank.

455
00:46:36,814 --> 00:46:38,232
- Who?
- Hank.

456
00:46:38,441 --> 00:46:39,817
What?

457
00:46:40,025 --> 00:46:41,735
- Oh, my God.
- What?

458
00:46:41,944 --> 00:46:45,114
- Oh, my God.
- Stay. What are you doing?
