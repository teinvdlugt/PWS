1
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,355
Mariano, it's me.
I need you to get Skyler on the line.

2
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,119
No, no, I need you to get her
on the phone right now.

3
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,475
Tell her it's urgent.

4
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,520
No-- What do you mean
she won't get off the phone?

5
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,674
I am giving you permission, Mariano.
You make her get off the phone.

6
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,396
Mariano, who is Skyler
on the phone with?

7
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,440
Yeah.

8
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,914
Okay.

9
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,598
Where is she? Where's Skyler?
She just kind of left.

10
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,036
She didn't say
where she was going.

11
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,835
Skyler, my-- My head is spinning.

12
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,395
And yours, I...

13
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,997
I can't even imagine.

14
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,430
So much makes sense to me now.

15
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,595
You jumping in the pool,
you sending us your kids, I get it.

16
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,429
I just wished I'd seen it sooner.

17
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,317
He's a monster.

18
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,240
He's a...

19
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,196
Look, I don't know what he did to you
to force you to keep his secrets.

20
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,792
If he threatened you,
or whatever mind games he played...

21
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,839
I don't know if there was abuse.

22
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,279
But I want you to know that
you can be open with me.

23
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,477
Don't hold anything back, okay?

24
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,429
I mean, I don't even understand
if you know the full extent of this,

25
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,920
what he's done.

26
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,472
Not just the meth cooking,
but the lives he's destroyed.

27
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,909
But, look, that's all behind you,
starting now.

28
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,030
You're done being his victim.

29
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,191
Because here's
what we're gonna do.

30
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,120
Sky, here's what we're gonna do.

31
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,474
You and the kids will
move back to our house,

32
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,792
where you'll be safe,
where he can't get to you.

33
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,553
Hank, does Marie...?

34
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,632
No. We'll get to that soon enough.

35
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,757
It's just you and me right now, okay?

36
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,156
Okay.

37
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,039
Before we, um...

38
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,520
Before we get you
back to the house, I...

39
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,035
I'm gonna ask you to tell me
everything you can.

40
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,192
Um, take as long as you like.

41
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,435
Just start from the beginning when you
first became aware of Walt's activities

42
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,311
and just try to be
as detailed as you can.

43
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,718
What, right-- Right here?

44
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,714
Right now?
Sure. Why not?

45
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,031
While it's still fresh, you know?

46
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,594
And just remember to state your name
and the date before you start.

47
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,433
Hank, do...?

48
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,155
Do we have to do this right now?

49
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,833
No, we don't have to do this
right now, no.

50
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,234
Here's the thing, I need something
solid that I can bring to my people.

51
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,511
A statement, on the record.

52
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,149
So you testifying to Walt's
criminal activity,

53
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,875
whatever you know,
goes a long, long way here.

54
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,635
Okay? I mean, you see,
building a case this big,

55
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,554
gathering evidence,
enough to get a conviction,

56
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,871
we're talking a long-haul proposition.

57
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,960
I don't want that bastard running out
the clock. But with your testimony--

58
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,396
What do you mean,
running out the clock?

59
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,152
His cancer. His cancer is back.

60
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,834
So he says.

61
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,554
He didn't tell you?

62
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,759
Who's to say it's even true?
Lying piece of shit.

63
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,275
Look, regardless,
I mean, we'll just assume.

64
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,550
Fine. Okay?

65
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,557
That son of a bitch looks me in the eye
and he says if what I know is true-- "If."

66
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,760
--he'll be dead before I can prove it.

67
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,957
The balls on that son of a...

68
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,512
I got all these little pieces.
They're all part of the story.

69
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,435
They don't mean much on their own,
but when you tell me what you know,

70
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,391
we start filling in the gaps, I'll have
him in lockup before the sun goes down.

71
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,359
Hank, I...

72
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,157
I think maybe...

73
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,993
Maybe I need a lawyer.

74
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,915
What?

75
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,999
No, no, no, you don't.

76
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,720
Yeah, I think maybe I do.

77
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,071
Skyler, understand,
I am here to help you.

78
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,596
But to do that, I need your help.

79
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,800
We start bringing in lawyers
and they start putting up roadblocks

80
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,713
where they don't need to be

81
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,032
and my ability to control
this situation diminishes.

82
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,438
Just for my own protection,
and just...

83
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,551
You know, it seems to make sense
that I should have someone to talk to.

84
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,591
Skyler, I'm your biggest advocate here,
and I'm telling you, for your own good,

85
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,520
you need to get out
ahead of this thing.

86
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,151
I mean, you start, you know,
getting defensive--

87
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,677
I'm not saying it's right,
but I'll tell you it's a fact,

88
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,639
the DA will look at you differently.

89
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,998
But you don't know that.
Skyler, yes, I do.

90
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,676
I've been around long enough to know.
It's in your best interest

91
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,197
to get out there and show the world
you have nothing to hide.

92
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,400
Look,

93
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,071
no one in the world
is more important to me

94
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,353
than your sister.

95
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,200
So believe me when I tell you

96
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,038
that your best interests
and mine are the same.

97
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,912
But, Hank, you telling me
not to talk to a lawyer

98
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,436
doesn't sound like that at all.

99
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,670
It sounds like what you want...

100
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,118
What you want is to get Walt

101
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,720
at all costs.

102
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,675
Okay.

103
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,559
Okay, let's just...

104
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,960
slow down. Slow down.

105
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,915
You can...

106
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,360
You can talk to a lawyer later.

107
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,196
But right now, what we need to do,

108
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,033
we need to go get the kids.

109
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,193
We need to bring them to my house
so that they're safe,

110
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,560
and then we need to help each other
put that animal away, okay?

111
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,636
Come on.
Hank.

112
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,679
Let's go to the house
and we'll deal with it there.

113
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,877
Am I under arrest?

114
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,519
What?
Am I under arrest?

115
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,836
Skyler, I--
You're not thinking straight about this.

116
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,272
You have to listen to me. I--
Skyler. Skyler. Skyler.

117
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,635
Am I under arrest?
No.

118
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,314
Am I under arrest?
No. Sky--

119
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,472
Hank, are you arresting me?
Sky--

120
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,791
Am I under arrest?!

121
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,875
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

122
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,037
I gotta do it, man.

123
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,596
Dude.
Mm.

124
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,070
What are you doing? Huell.

125
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,272
Hey, quit screwing around.
Mm.

126
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,195
We are here to do a job,
not channel Scrooge McDuck.

127
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,510
You hearing me?

128
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,239
I hear you.

129
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,470
Dude.

130
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,640
Aw, screw it.

131
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,239
Mexico.

132
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,676
All's I'm saying.

133
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,317
Guy hit 10 guys in jail
within a two-minute window.

134
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,398
All's I'm saying.

135
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,838
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, you've got to hide those bags.

136
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,038
The monkey is in
the banana patch, capiche?

137
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,913
So call me.

138
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,437
That's the third message.
Where the hell is that kid?

139
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,112
That's her.
Don't.

140
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,272
I have to talk to her.
You don't.

141
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,956
Answer that phone and Schrader's
on the line with a wiretap

142
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,397
recording everything.
You're not doing anybody any favors.

143
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,917
Why do you still have a battery
in that thing? Take it out.

144
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,754
They might be trying
to triangulate your movements.

145
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,196
I'm not being paranoid. Do it.

146
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,114
I can't believe she went to him.
She just panicked.

147
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,114
She went right to him
without even talking to me.

148
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,631
I'm not saying it's not bad.
It's bad, but it could be worse.

149
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,999
Really? How much worse could it be,
exactly, in your estimation?

150
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,238
What does she actually know?
What has she seen? Hm?

151
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,995
Nothing. It's hearsay.
It's all he said, she said.

152
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,437
The only real evidence that
she can lead them to is your money.

153
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,514
Once we take care of that,
well, yeah, then they got nothing.

154
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,833
Nothing? Hank knows.
That's not nothing.

155
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,470
Yeah. I can't exactly see him
turning the other cheek.

156
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,629
Of course there's always, um...

157
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,720
Always what?

158
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,480
Have you given any thought to,
um, sending him on a trip to Belize?

159
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,473
Belize?
Yeah, Belize.

160
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,472
You know, where, uh...

161
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,999
Where Mike went to,
off on a trip to, uh, Belize.

162
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,951
Saul, you better not be saying
what I think you're saying.

163
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,033
It's just conjecture on my part.
Hank is family.

164
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,795
Okay, it's an option that--
You understand that?

165
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,998
It's an option that has worked well
for you in the past.

166
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,871
Jesus. What is wrong with you?
My mistake. Family, off limits, of course.

167
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,431
I'm just throwing thoughts out there.
This is a safe room, right?

168
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,355
Jesus. Send him to Belize.
I'll send you to Belize.

169
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,520
Finally.

170
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,199
It's about time.
Have you two been followed?

171
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,714
Are you sure?

172
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,719
If they had, we'd all be
in handcuffs right now.

173
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,275
I took the tops off.

174
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,274
Figured you'd wanna check
to make sure it's all there.

175
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,874
You figured right.

176
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,070
Close enough.

177
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,514
If you need any help on the other end...
These things are a bitch to move.

178
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,240
I'll manage.
And we don't mind overtime.

179
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,754
Ain't no thing.

180
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,273
Pay Huell and Kuby
and take your cut.

181
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,399
The rest is mine.
Insurance in case I need you.

182
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,598
In case you need me?
I'm thinking the probability is high.

183
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,240
Just find Jesse.

184
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,995
Keys.

185
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,314
Saul Goodman, please. Skyler White.

186
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,796
No, no, please don't tell me
he isn't there.

187
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,600
I know he's been avoiding my calls.

188
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,676
All right, well,
has my husband been there?

189
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,836
What do you mean you don't know?
Either he has or he hasn't. I don't--

190
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,192
Sweetie.

191
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,150
Sky?

192
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,513
Sky, I know you're home.

193
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,151
Let me in. Let me talk to you.

194
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,520
I'm just gonna wait here
until you open the door.

195
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,876
So let me in now
or three hours from now,

196
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,600
but I'm not leaving until I see you.

197
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,599
Skyler, please.

198
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,360
Just you.

199
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,639
Not Hank.

200
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,636
Tell me Hank is crazy.

201
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,193
Tell me he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

202
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,515
You gotta give me something, Skyler.

203
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,240
Anything to help me understand.

204
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,638
It can't be true.

205
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,673
Oh, my God.

206
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,675
How long have you known?

207
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,474
Hank said that when you walked
into the pool, that's when you knew.

208
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,319
When you had your...

209
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,480
But not then. Before that.

210
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,431
Since Gus Fring?

211
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,353
The money.

212
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,195
All that money that Walt made

213
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,915
when you bought your car wash.

214
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,072
And your whole gambling story.

215
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,880
That was a lie.
I...

216
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,391
Did you know then?

217
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,433
You had to.

218
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,074
Skyler...

219
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,360
did you know
since before Hank was shot?

220
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,279
Skyler?

221
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,432
Marie.

222
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,351
I am so sorry.

223
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,077
You're sorry.

224
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,356
You're...

225
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,279
I'm sick of--

226
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,479
You won't talk.

227
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,757
You won't talk to Hank

228
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,754
because you think that Walt
is going to get away with this.

229
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,120
Oh, God.

230
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,677
Come on, baby. Come on.

231
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,594
Let's go.
Marie. Marie. Hey.

232
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,070
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?

233
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,879
She's coming with us.
No, she is not.

234
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,474
Give her back to me. Marie.

235
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,478
Hank. Hank, help! Hank!

236
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,789
You are not leaving this house
with my daughter.

237
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,553
Give her back to me.

238
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,030
Marie, give her back to me.
Stop it.

239
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,435
You're scaring her.

240
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,796
Give her back.
I'm trying to protect her.

241
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,158
I'm her mother.
She's not gonna live in this madhouse!

242
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,233
You don't know what you're
talking about. Give her back.

243
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,437
Marie.
Listen, I will call the police.

244
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,071
You call them. You call them, Skyler.
I will. Give me my baby.

245
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,709
Marie, put her down.
You can't take her away.

246
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,837
Marie.
Give me my baby.

247
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,719
We are not leaving without her.

248
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,190
Give me my baby now!
Marie!

249
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,880
Do it now.

250
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,672
Give her back.

251
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,236
That's right. It's okay. It's okay.

252
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,996
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

253
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,833
It's okay. It's okay. I got you.

254
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,959
Okay, Mama has you now.

255
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,232
Mama has you now.
Mama has you. Shh.

256
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,111
It's okay. It's okay.

257
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,279
Shh.

258
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,199
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

259
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,996
It's okay.

260
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,319
You have to get him.

261
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:13,119
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

262
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,236
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

263
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,272
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

264
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,234
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

265
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,638
Walt.

266
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,592
Where have you been?

267
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,794
Oh, my God.

268
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,958
What happened?

269
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,200
You moved the money, didn't you?
You buried it somewhere.

270
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,156
Did you get my messages?

271
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,754
I told Hank nothing.

272
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,595
Walt, I swear I didn't.

273
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,558
Say something.

274
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,633
Please.

275
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,836
Oh, my God.

276
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,040
Walt. Walt.

277
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,520
Hey.

278
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,040
How--? How long was I out?

279
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,837
Four or five hours.
Oh.

280
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,596
How are you feeling?

281
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,999
It's true.

282
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,237
The cancer is back.

283
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,473
Is this it?

284
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,150
Does that make you happy?

285
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,998
I can't remember
the last time I was happy.

286
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,317
Just tell me.

287
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,790
I know you talked with Hank.

288
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,392
I know you made a deal.

289
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,517
Skyler, I'll make this easy.

290
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,710
I'll give myself up
if you promise me one thing.

291
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,591
You keep the money.

292
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,632
Never speak of it.

293
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,038
Never give it up.

294
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,320
You pass it on to our children.

295
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,957
Give them everything.

296
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,837
Would you do that?

297
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,999
Please.

298
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,952
Please don't let me
have done all this for nothing.

299
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,036
How did Hank find out?

300
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,633
Did somebody talk?

301
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,315
No, no one talked.

302
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,439
It was me.

303
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,359
I screwed up.

304
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,994
The way Hank talks,

305
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,035
he's got his suspicions.

306
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,237
Not much else.

307
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,597
You can't give yourself up
without giving up the money.

308
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,435
It's the way this works, Walt.

309
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,555
So maybe our best move here...

310
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,631
is to stay quiet.

311
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,191
Okay, you can take it off now.

312
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,878
All right, what's so important
you had to come way out here?

313
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,679
The amount of money
I'm bringing in,

314
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,073
I deserve to see why
it's all going wrong.

315
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,993
You an expert on meth labs now?

316
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,675
You gonna tell us
how to fix our operation?

317
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,950
And what if I can help?
What will it hurt to show me?

318
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,795
I don't like my time being wasted.

319
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,796
Well, I'm here, and 10 minutes
is a small sacrifice

320
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,674
when we're talking about
a $50 million shortfall.

321
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,560
So?

322
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,272
Safe to come down?

323
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,592
Yeah. You're good.

324
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,632
Ladies first.

325
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,277
Okay, now you've seen it.
Yeah, now I've seen it.

326
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,196
What?

327
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,911
Well, how about
we start with it's filthy.

328
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,073
What are you, my mother?
What filthy? It's just dimly lit.

329
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,950
Do you seriously think this is up to
the standards of your predecessor?

330
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,191
Because it's not. Not even close.

331
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,194
Well, the product we're making,
it's selling just fine.

332
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,670
Heisenberg's standards
don't matter anymore.

333
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,231
To whom? A bunch
of scabby Arizona tweakers?

334
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,992
They matter to my buyer in the Czech
Republic, therefore, they matter to me.

335
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,120
Look, I cannot move what this person
is making if it's substandard.

336
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,432
And it is. It just is. No offense.

337
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,991
If you can do better, do better.
I don't know what to tell you.

338
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,117
You tried to get the man back, right?

339
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,034
He said no, so...
I mean, what do you want me to do?

340
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,317
Todd. Use Todd again.

341
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,269
Look, he learned from him, all right?

342
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,399
At least Todd's first two cooks
were at 74 percent.

343
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,557
On his third cook, he started a fire.

344
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,713
Look, I tried Heisenberg's way.
It didn't work out.

345
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,191
I wanna cook in my territory.
I wanna use guys that I trust,

346
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,232
not Todd, who I don't.

347
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,956
And that's the end of the conversation
as far as I'm concerned.

348
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,237
I really wish you'd have
given him a chance.

349
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,551
Hey. We have a problem.

350
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,920
You stay here.

351
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,590
Get down!

352
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,670
Hello? Ma'am, you okay?

353
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,074
Hello?

354
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,076
Safe to come up whenever you want.

355
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,200
I...

356
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,193
I don't want to see.

357
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,434
Okay.

358
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,594
Cool, so I guess maybe, um...

359
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,669
Maybe just close your eyes.

360
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,674
Okay.

361
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,474
This way.

362
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,239
To the right.

363
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,278
Ha-ha. Are you kidding me with this?

364
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,311
Heh.
Uncle Jack.

365
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,715
Fire in the hole.

366
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,675
It's okay. Sorry about that.

367
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,120
It's cool, lady.

368
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,396
Okay, boys, let's take it all.
Let's get everything.

369
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,595
Hey.

370
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,594
You...

371
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,158
going into work today?

372
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,558
You're kidding, right?

373
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,239
What about you?

374
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,790
Are you going to the office?

375
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,077
You have to tell them, Hank.

376
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,560
Today.

377
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,396
Marie, I just-- I just don't have it yet.

378
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,597
The piece I need to prove it all,
it's just not here.

379
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,558
Then let them help you.

380
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,473
Tell Steve, tell Ramey.

381
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,520
You've got enough to get them
to believe your story at least.

382
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,512
Put the whole DEA on it.

383
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,240
That's how this is
supposed to work, right?

384
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,629
No.

385
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,515
No?

386
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,153
What no? What are you,
Lone Wolf McQuade?

387
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,040
Look, baby--
You've gotta go in with this, Hank.

388
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,079
Look, the day I go in with this...

389
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,509
that's the last day of my career,
all right?

390
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,557
I'm going to have to walk in there,
look those people in the eye

391
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,637
and admit that the person
I've been chasing the past year

392
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,599
is my own brother-in-law.

393
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,152
It's over for me.

394
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,509
Ten seconds after I tell this story,
I'm a civilian.

395
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,279
And then how can we help Skyler
if she comes to her senses?

396
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,712
When I go in there...

397
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,513
I'm bringing proof, not suspicions.

398
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,757
I can be the man who caught him,
at least.

399
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,354
What if you wait

400
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,078
and they catch Walt without you?

401
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,830
If they find out that you knew
and you said nothing?

402
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,314
Hank, wouldn't you go to jail too?

403
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,915
Hey, Hank. Welcome back.

404
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,720
Morning.

405
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,959
Hey.
Hey, boss.

406
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,590
How you doing, Hank?
Hey.

407
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,358
Hey. Look who's back.

408
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,591
I had to see it with my own eyes.

409
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,474
How you doing?
Good. Yeah, yeah. You miss me?

410
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,030
Miss you? Like my balls
miss jock itch, maybe.

411
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,998
Yeah? I didn't know you had balls.

412
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,675
All right, don't make me sorry
I stopped by here.

413
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,714
Anyway, you got
a budget meeting in an hour,

414
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,556
then a meet-and-greet with
the new prescription task force guys.

415
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,915
All right. Hey, you know, listen.

416
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,960
Let's see if we can get
that budget meeting pushed

417
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,316
and instead see if you could set up
a conference call with Ramey.

418
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,834
What for?

419
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,677
Just a "getting back up to speed" thing,
you know, for me.

420
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,998
All right. You got it.

421
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,637
Oh, hey. Did you hear
about that money thing?

422
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,000
No, what money thing?

423
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,393
Oh, you're gonna love this.
It involves your old pal Jesse Pinkman.

424
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,560
Pinkman?

425
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,920
I'll give you this.
Jesse, you're never boring.

426
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,673
Not boring at all.

427
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,834
So come on, buddy, share with us.

428
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,994
Why were you tossing
millions of dollars all over Albuquerque?

429
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,192
I promise you we can hold out
just as long as you can.

430
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,632
That's a fact. I got a bladder
the size of a hot water bottle.

431
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,872
Man, all that cash. I wouldn't
be able to stop talking about it.

432
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,555
I know. But I don't think I'd be
tossing it out my car window.

433
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,949
Heh-heh. Yeah.

434
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,232
My take-home doesn't allow
for that whole Robin Hood thing.

435
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,199
But apparently Jesse is raking it in.
Yes, indeed.

436
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,195
I'm sure he's got a perfectly reasonable
explanation for where he got it.

437
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,919
Sure. He found it.

438
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,596
Or won it in a card game, maybe.
That's it. Won it in a card game.

439
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,439
Lucky night at the casino.

440
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,712
Jesse, did you have a lucky night?

441
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,313
Okay. Jesse, we're gonna let you
gather your thoughts

442
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,194
so we can continue
this stimulating conversation.

443
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,679
Can we get you anything?
Coffee? A soda?

444
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,993
Right.
Yeah. Thought not.

445
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,960
I have a history
with Jesse Pinkman,

446
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,080
and I think he can be helpful to me
on another active investigation.

447
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,995
Look, I'm only asking
for a couple minutes here.

448
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,917
You said he wasn't talking?
Let me tell you, that kid hates my guts.

449
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,912
Despises me, okay?

450
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,232
Maybe I can get him cranked up
enough that he starts yapping.

451
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,879
Then you guys go in, get what you need
from the little shit-stain, finish him off.

452
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,150
Gives me anything useful while he's
with me, I'll share it, 100 percent.

453
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,595
I could use a smoke break.
Yeah. How about you?

454
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,198
Yeah. Maybe you could keep an eye on our
suspect for us, just for a few minutes.

455
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,670
Absolutely.
I can do that.

456
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,996
Okay.

457
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,640
All right, guys.
