1
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,956
Think you'll be okay
waiting here by yourself?

2
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,626
Yeah, whatever.

3
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,631
Sir, if you'd like to smoke, you need
to be another 20 feet from the door.

4
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,801
So roll me further, bitch.

5
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,699
What's coming?

6
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,994
Male, Caucasian. Early 40s.
Multiple gunshot wounds.

7
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,667
BP is 70. Seven-zero over palp.

8
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,797
Pulse 140. One-four-zero.
Weak and thready at the brachial.

9
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,382
No breath sounds on the right side,
belly is rigid.

10
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,052
Appears pale and diaphoretic.
How many entry wounds?

11
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,513
Four. Shoulder and hip,
through and through.

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,350
Right lung in lower left quadrant,
no visible exit wounds.

13
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,018
Let's get him 2 grams of oxygen.

14
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,521
- What's his hemoglobin?
- Seven-point-three.

15
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,191
Need two large-bore IVs,
six units O-neg.

16
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,236
Type and cross for six more units,
chest x-ray and KUB.

17
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,322
Notify the OR, we are on the way.

18
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,201
OR 1 is clear. Let's put him in there.

19
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,025
Yo, Jesse, sorry I'm late, man.

20
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,239
Damn, brother, look at you.

21
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,575
That's messed up.

22
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,244
How are you feeling? You okay?

23
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,246
Actually...

24
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,250
...I'm great.

25
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,275
I don't understand.

26
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,611
I thought things
were going pretty well.

27
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,489
I thought we were kind of simpatico.

28
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,368
You know?
We were becoming a real team.

29
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,956
Not... Not so much, no.

30
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,502
Is this about the temperature setting?
I can assure you that will not happen...

31
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,504
No, it's bigger than that, Gale.

32
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,467
It's much more than that.

33
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,510
Could you elaborate?

34
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,180
Well, yes, of course I could...

35
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,017
...but I don't think either of us...

36
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,020
...would necessarily benefit
from a prolonged...

37
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,149
Yeah, so...

38
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,484
Yeah.

39
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,278
I set up the entire lab.

40
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,822
You said you liked the configuration.

41
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,699
And I do.

42
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,993
For the most part.

43
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:51,123
Look, you're a fine chemist, really,
with a promising future.

44
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,460
It's just that I...

45
00:04:54,628 --> 00:05:01,676
That we just have different rhythms,
Gale.

46
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,177
You see... It's...

47
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:08,057
It's as if I'm classical...

48
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:13,813
...but you are more jazz.

49
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,566
- Jazz.
- Jazz. Yes.

50
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,528
And God knows
there is nothing wrong with jazz.

51
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:26,367
It's simply that I require...

52
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,245
- Classical.
- Exactly.

53
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,374
Oh, shit.

54
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,544
Man, this is the bomb.

55
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,761
What's up, partner?

56
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,392
- I can't believe this.
- My replacement?

57
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,602
Oh, Jesus.

58
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,272
Hi. Gale.

59
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,607
- Nice to meet you.
- What's up?

60
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,360
Damn, we should've ditched that RV
months ago.

61
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,071
It's all, like, shiny up in here.

62
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,787
I'm sorry, I must be missing something.
I don't mean... I don't mean to be...

63
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,957
- This...
- No.

64
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,878
- Makes no sense.

65
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:31,098
So I guess this is...

66
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,937
Oh, dear mother of God.

67
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,275
This is for the best.

68
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,404
Two hundred pounds a week. Got it?

69
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,448
Yeah.

70
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,784
Oh, man.

71
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,745
Mr. White.

72
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,842
Okay, there's a lot to show you.

73
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,303
Some new techniques to learn.

74
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,932
- What, now?
- Yes, now.

75
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,102
We've only got a couple days
before our next batch is due.

76
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,978
And I need to get you up to speed.

77
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,067
Right on. I'm just saying...

78
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,154
How's the cell service down here?

79
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,989
It's nonexistent.

80
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,616
We're shielded.

81
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,119
There's a hard line for emergencies.
Come on.

82
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,496
So you haven't talked
to anybody today...

83
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,290
...other than, you know,
Captain Nerd there.

84
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,584
Why?

85
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,379
Your brother-in-law.

86
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,840
What about him?

87
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,345
- What's the story?
- He was unresponsive.

88
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,681
You getting exposure
on those wounds?

89
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,891
- Two units of normal saline.
- Bivalve mass.

90
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,019
Breath sounds bilaterally.
Femur's like a wet bag of gravel.

91
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,689
Other one's not much better.
Get those boots off.

92
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,984
See if you get a pulse.
Get blood-pressure cup or an ABI?

93
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,235
Where's that blood?

94
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:11,907
Dr. Bording to Cardiology.

95
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,326
- Sir, can I help you?
- Yeah, I...

96
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,996
- It's all right. He's family.
- Thank you.

97
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:22,626
Marie. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, honey.

98
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,008
I'm so sorry.

99
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,760
I don't know what to say.

100
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,853
- How is he?
- I don't know.

101
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,898
They won't really tell us anything.
He's still in surgery.

102
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,902
They shot him four times.

103
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,863
Oh, Christ.

104
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,745
- Where's Holly?
- I got a sitter.

105
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,375
- Hey, how are you, huh?
- Fine.

106
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,044
Yeah?

107
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,255
Sure?

108
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,593
I'm fine. I just need some fresh air.

109
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,971
Okay.

110
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:20,601
- Here. Let me get the door.
- I got it. I'm fine.

111
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:28,943
Walt. Walt, this is ASAC Merkert.
Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

112
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,111
- Hello.
- I'm very sorry.

113
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,613
Thank you.

114
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,158
Can you tell us anything?
Any details?

115
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,953
Right now, all we know
is two men ambushed Hank.

116
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,122
They didn't have any ID on them.
Probably Mexican nationals.

117
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,752
Their tattoos indicated an affiliation
with a drug cartel.

118
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,131
Why did they attack Hank?

119
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,800
We're not sure yet.

120
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:56,971
It could be in relation to an
investigation Hank was working...

121
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:01,642
...or it could be a message
to the DEA in general.

122
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,437
They had an axe.

123
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,858
The cartels tend to be dramatic.

124
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,860
Jesus.

125
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,825
- Where are they? I mean, did they...?
- Hank got both of them.

126
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:21,662
He killed one outright, the other one's
upstairs in critical condition.

127
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,541
Your brother-in-law's one tough
son of a bitch to take them both out...

128
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,377
...considering
he didn't even have his gun.

129
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,340
He didn't have his gun?

130
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,639
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

131
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,517
Marie, the assault charge.

132
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,520
I had to suspend Hank
pending the investigation.

133
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,648
That means
I had to take away his weapon.

134
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,358
You had to take it.

135
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,361
- It's standard procedure. No one...
- Okay. All right, listen.

136
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:59,158
If you all listened to him from the start
and let him arrest that degenerate...

137
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,869
...he wouldn't have taken things
into his own hands.

138
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,705
And he would've had a gun
and could've defended himself.

139
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,207
- Marie, let's just...
- No. Just...

140
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,086
It's their fault.

141
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,339
He didn't have a gun.

142
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,549
Honey, this isn't helping you.

143
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,384
You.

144
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,554
What kind of partner are you?

145
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,434
You were supposed to back him up,
and where were you?

146
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,519
Where were you?

147
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,563
Texas.

148
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,691
And you.

149
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,028
You're supposed
to protect your agents...

150
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,238
...instead of taking their guns...

151
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,241
...not supporting them,
not backing them up.

152
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,910
- Marie. Marie.
- When they...

153
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,706
Honey, let's just go and sit down,
okay?

154
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,711
I'm not doing anything until these two
get the hell out of here. I mean it.

155
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,094
- Sorry...
- Go.

156
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,137
You are not welcome here.

157
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:06,725
- The DEA is not welcome here.
- Okay, honey.

158
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,060
Come on.

159
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,604
Come on. Let's go sit down.

160
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,244
It's not just them.

161
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,289
It's you, Walt.

162
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:40,134
This Pinkman
that Hank was looking for...

163
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,262
...Hank would have never
even heard his name...

164
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,141
...if you hadn't bought marijuana
from him.

165
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,269
- Marie...
- Do you ever think about that, Walt?

166
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,146
Do you?

167
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,482
Do you think about everything
that you have put him through?

168
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,693
Marie, stop.

169
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,988
You're upset, and you're looking
for someone to blame...

170
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,949
...and it's understandable,
but don't blame Walt.

171
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,618
It's not his fault.

172
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,711
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

173
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,714
- Sweetheart...
- No. No. Don't...

174
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:26,013
- It's okay.
- It's Hank.

175
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,931
It's all right.

176
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,034
All right, you're done.

177
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,497
Okay, next.

178
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,800
Hello.

179
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,972
Hello, hello, hello.

180
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,062
Yeah.

181
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:53,076
Yo, yo, yo.
Jesse Pinkman in the house.

182
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:00,500
Oh, my dear God.

183
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,497
Walter White
to the nearest courtesy phone.

184
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,250
Walter White,
please pick up a courtesy phone.

185
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,889
Yo, we working sometime this year?

186
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,727
What the hell are you thinking?
Why are you calling me here?

187
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,522
Tried your cell
and it went straight to voicemail.

188
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,191
- How am I to get a hold of you?
- You aren't.

189
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,236
It's been a whole day.
How long is this grieving process?

190
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,071
Just put a clock on it for me.

191
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:14,116
All I'm saying
is we have a schedule, right?

192
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,910
My family
comes before your schedule.

193
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,079
Dude, it's not my schedule.

194
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:23,667
- We have responsibilities here.
- I'll get there when I get there.

195
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:27,796
You know what? Whatever.
I'll just cook on my own.

196
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,757
- You will do no such thing.
- Why not?

197
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,593
Well, for starters...

198
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,763
...you aren't the least bit familiar
with any of the equipment.

199
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,433
There's gotta be some sort of manual,
right?

200
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,436
- And I can read.
- Jesse, touch nothing.

201
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,813
Stop treating me
like I'm like your assistant.

202
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,608
I'm not your bitch to order around.
We're partners. Remember?

203
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:54,948
I need you to sit patiently and wait,
I will be there as soon as I can.

204
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,284
Thank you very much
for your kind words.

205
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:01,329
- We really do appreciate that.
- What, is your wife there?

206
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,457
Yes. Yes, she is.

207
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,251
She would be happy to know
you asked about her.

208
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,086
Please do keep us in your thoughts.

209
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,297
Hey, tell your douche bag
brother-in-law...

210
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,507
...to head towards the light.

211
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:19,014
So I'm thinking maybe we should go
get everybody some breakfast.

212
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,976
Yeah, that sounds good.
Do you know who that was?

213
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:42,996
You know,
these eggs are really not too bad.

214
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,012
- Look at that.
- Look at what?

215
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,349
At what? This. These spots.

216
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,185
This fork is absolutely filthy.

217
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,818
Tell me you see this.
You've got good eyes. Look at that.

218
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,321
Marie, those are just water spots.

219
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,531
That's fine.

220
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,200
Those are not "water spots."

221
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,369
It's dirt.

222
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:25,872
This silverware's
obviously not been cleaned.

223
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,709
It's covered in germs
from someone else's mouth.

224
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,170
God knows what.

225
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,174
Seriously, Aunt Marie,
it's water spots.

226
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,386
Ours at home aren't any better.

227
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,430
Yours at home are irrelevant.
We're in a hospital.

228
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,767
They need to be a higher standard.
They have a responsibility.

229
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,519
Well, I'm not actually sure...

230
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,565
...if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies
as being part of the hospital.

231
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,901
It's in the same building.
It's all under the same roof.

232
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,611
Do you think that sick people...

233
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,447
...aren't eating
with this bacteria-infested silverware?

234
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,826
My God, how are you supposed
to survive this death trap?

235
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,372
Marie...

236
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,835
I survived.

237
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,881
I had my lobectomy at this hospital.

238
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,716
Remember that?

239
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,094
Remember how scared we all were?

240
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:26,933
I didn't wanna act like it,
but I was terrified.

241
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,395
All that week, all I could think of...

242
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:35,150
...was how they were actually
going to cut me open...

243
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,445
...and take out a part of me...

244
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,781
...that was with me my entire life.

245
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,242
I couldn't get that image
out of my head.

246
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:53,084
I think the scariest part
was when they took me into pre-op.

247
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:58,423
Lying there,
waiting for them to anesthetize you.

248
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,012
Knowing that you may never
wake up again.

249
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:15,148
Actually what I really remember
about that day...

250
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,817
...is driving to the hospital.

251
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,820
Skyler, you remember me
wanting to drive that day?

252
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,156
Yeah.

253
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:27,160
Anyway, there we are.
We're driving up Central...

254
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,497
...and we hit every green light.

255
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:35,835
I mean,
every single light that we hit... green.

256
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,339
It's just... When does that happen?

257
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:45,971
Just like, bang, bang,
green the entire way.

258
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:50,308
And the whole time,
all I could think about was:

259
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:55,855
"Why today? Why?
Why can't I just spend...

260
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,150
...a few extra minutes in the car
with my family?"

261
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:05,532
I never wanted to be stuck in traffic
so bad in my life.

262
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,869
At least I was with my family.

263
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,707
I had that.

264
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:23,216
Anyway, I survived this place.

265
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,387
And I'm not half the man
your husband is.

266
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,541
Yes?

267
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,918
What the hell is going on up there?

268
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,129
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

269
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,797
You know about my men?

270
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,634
I heard that they attacked a DEA agent.
Why would they do that?

271
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,805
What's the matter?
Spanish not good enough anymore?

272
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,977
I didn't order this, and my men
would never do this on their own.

273
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,938
Someone gave the go-ahead.

274
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,399
Are you accusing me?

275
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,152
I'm just saying
they wouldn't act on their own.

276
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,447
I am not in the habit
of picking my own pocket.

277
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,910
I assume that the next shipment
will be delayed.

278
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:35,580
- Any thoughts on when it might arrive?
- A week, a month.

279
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:39,793
There's too much focus on the border.
We lay low for the time being.

280
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,128
We lay low,
and then we get the real story...

281
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,797
...from my man who survived.

282
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,800
Your man is in custody.

283
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,134
God bless America!

284
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,845
He's innocent until proven guilty.
Correct?

285
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,806
I'll get him the best lawyer...

286
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,974
...and then we'll learn the truth.

287
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,811
Well, keep me apprised.

288
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,942
Any time you got that close proximity
to the spine...

289
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,444
...there's always gonna be cause
for concern...

290
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,364
...but as I say,
it's really too soon to tell.

291
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,158
He's out of surgery, at least, which is...

292
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,662
- Out of surgery, on his way to recovery.
- All right. And where's that?

293
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,831
Unfortunately, you can't see him yet.

294
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,166
We're gonna have to wait
for him to stabilize.

295
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,002
How long will that take?

296
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,213
I can't really say. It could be hours.

297
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,675
But we'll let you know
just as soon as you can see him.

298
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,970
Thank you.

299
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,812
Maybe we should get you home
for a couple hours?

300
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,981
Get some rest?

301
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,692
I'm not going anywhere.

302
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,819
Me neither.

303
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:57,704
Well, is anyone else
dying to brush their teeth...

304
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:59,539
...or is it just me?

305
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,043
What if I ran over to the house
and picked up a few things?

306
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,838
Marie? I could swing by your place.

307
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:10,175
That would be great. Thanks, Walt.

308
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,553
Okay.

309
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,695
Walt. Walt.

310
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,906
We just heard he came through.

311
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,534
Yeah, well, it's, you know,
guardedly good news.

312
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,620
- Thank God. I'll take it.
- Yeah.

313
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,956
Hey, guys,
this is Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

314
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,292
- Good to meet you. Hi.
- Hey.

315
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,046
- We were just swapping Hank stories.
- That could go on all day.

316
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,423
God knows,
there's a million of them.

317
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,553
- Meanwhile...
- Miserable piece of shit.

318
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,306
Guy who shot him, one that's left,
he's up there.

319
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:01,309
Got the painkillers going on,
resting comfortably.

320
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,102
Your tax dollars at work.

321
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,772
You ought to see what Hank did
to that bastard.

322
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,983
Wanna see?

323
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,778
Come on, let me show you.

324
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,718
You comfortable, you piece of shit?

325
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,362
- You got him?
- Come on.

326
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:40,033
- All right.
- Easy now, easy.

327
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,567
Come here.

328
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,364
No.

329
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,077
Oh, shit.

330
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,794
Yeah.

331
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,016
Finally. About damn time.

332
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,948
Why isn't there anything cooking?

333
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,176
Walter White
to the nearest courtesy phone.

334
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,679
- Operator.
- This is Walter White.

335
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,556
I'll connect you.

336
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,687
Yo, we got problems, big ones.

337
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:18,566
Reverend, so nice of you to call.
Again.

338
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,151
Turn your phone on already.

339
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,362
You know,
I will definitely look into that.

340
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,408
I'll tell you what. Why don't I just
call you right back on my cell phone?

341
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,035
Okay?

342
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:34,415
I told you to wait. I don't know
how many more ways I could say it.

343
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,542
Yeah, dick, I was waiting...

344
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,462
...and then that creepy, quiet guy
showed up.

345
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,381
- Gus came by?
- Not him, man.

346
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,884
Apparently
I'm not worthy of meeting him.

347
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,720
The other one.
The one I'm qualified to speak to.

348
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,430
He started asking questions too.

349
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:53,601
Like why haven't we cooked anything.
All right, we have a quota.

350
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:57,396
It's due tomorrow.
Do you seriously not care or what?

351
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,441
Because that guy,
he's got, like, the dead eyes.

352
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,901
Let me ask you something.

353
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,779
Do you remember when we were
out in the desert with Tuco?

354
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,241
Oh, you mean when he put
a machine gun to my head?

355
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,202
Yeah, I think that does ring a tiny bell.
Why?

356
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,871
No. He kept... He kept saying...

357
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,708
...that someone was coming up
from Mexico to get us.

358
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,419
Do you remember?
Now, who was that?

359
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:24,924
What the hell has this got to do with...?
Look, I don't know. It was...

360
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,762
His cousins.

361
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,224
Right, Jesse? It was...
It was his cousins.

362
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,935
Yeah, cousins.

363
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,645
Whatever, man. Why?

364
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,249
Any news?

365
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,251
No change.

366
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:08,092
Okay, well, I didn't know
whose toothbrushes were whose...

367
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,262
...so I just stopped by the drugstore.

368
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,806
Thank God for travel sizes, right?

369
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,474
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

370
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,603
Yeah.

371
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,359
Oh, I think I'm gonna
go wash my face.

372
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,612
I'm going crazy.

373
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:31,657
- Do you wanna come?
- Yeah.

374
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,500
Nurse Franklin,
please page the operator.

375
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,211
Nurse Franklin, page the operator.

376
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,217
I got candy bars.

377
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,557
Is this what you were asking for?

378
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,809
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

379
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,229
Yeah, I skimmed through it.

380
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,815
- Looks interesting.
- Yeah.

381
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,152
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

382
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,325
Well, what's it about?

383
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,832
Pablo Escobar,
this big drug guy in the '80s.

384
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,044
Yeah. Yeah.
I remember seeing him on the news.

385
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:30,216
Well, it's more about the guys
who investigated him...

386
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,885
...and tried to bring him down.

387
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:36,055
Some of them were DEA, you know?

388
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:41,394
Uncle Hank said
that they were worth learning about...

389
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,689
...that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is...

390
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,567
...but nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

391
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,655
I guess I never thought about it.

392
00:33:55,659 --> 00:34:02,748
He said that good guys never get ink
like the bad guys do.

393
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,759
So he gave it to me.

394
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,595
Figured I'd read it.

395
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:32,570
I need to...

396
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,739
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

397
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,916
No, I assure you.
We are hard at work. Absolutely.

398
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,754
So I can expect delivery by tomorrow
as scheduled.

399
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:51,964
Well...

400
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,467
Unfortunately...

401
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,343
Unfortunately...

402
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:00,681
...we're not going to be able
to keep our schedule this week.

403
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,100
But not for lack of trying.

404
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,311
Is there something I should know?

405
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:09,315
Well, to be completely honest
with you...

406
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,651
...Gale really screwed us up.

407
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,822
I mean, not on purpose, of course,
but he just... He set us way back.

408
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,784
And we've been playing catch-up
ever since.

409
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,331
And I've had to be out
running errands...

410
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,833
...and trying to keep us on target.

411
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,338
Some of the equipment
wasn't calibrated correctly...

412
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:35,508
Well, it's just all very technical
and boring.

413
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,803
But rest assured that...

414
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,263
That we will do whatever it takes.

415
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,682
It has my total attention.

416
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,060
We'll cook through the weekend
if necessary.

417
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:51,273
We will have 400 pounds for you
by next week.

418
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,529
I have your word on that?

419
00:35:56,696 --> 00:36:00,199
You do. You have my word on that.

420
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,869
Thank you for the update.

421
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,227
Yeah. Right.

422
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,106
Any news?

423
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:36,235
No, I'm just wandering.

424
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:41,740
- How's everybody doing?
- Well, as well as can be expected.

425
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,952
It's this not knowing...

426
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,580
...that's the hardest part, I think.

427
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,417
Anything new on these guys?

428
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,586
Who they are? What they wanted?

429
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:57,631
No, nothing yet, but we'll get it.

430
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,596
Steve...

431
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,434
Do you think
there could maybe be others?

432
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:12,605
Buddy, nobody's getting to Hank.

433
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,107
That was their one shot
and they blew it.

434
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,610
So no.

435
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,154
No way.

436
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:22,948
Jesus.

437
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,660
I'd love to walk in there and shoot
that bastard right in the head.

438
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,454
Me too.

439
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,422
Yeah?

440
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,174
Oh, yeah?

441
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,927
Great. We'll be right down.

442
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,345
Food's here.

443
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,472
Hey, you like Pollos Hermanos?

444
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,266
- You guys coming?
- Yeah.

445
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,103
- On occasion, yeah.
- Owner's a big booster for the DEA.

446
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,607
He heard what happened. He's gonna
feed every cop in the building.

447
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,361
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

448
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,489
And, apparently,
he's bringing it by personally.

449
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,000
- I don't even know what to say.
- That's an incredible...

450
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,836
- Good, huh?
- Delicious.

451
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,965
That's so generous of you.
Thank you very much.

452
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,509
Yes, thank you.
Guys, did you hear that?

453
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:26,345
Mr. Fring is offering
a 10,000-dollar reward...

454
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,555
...on any information about the case.

455
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,518
Well, that's... That's wonderful.

456
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,687
Wow, thank you, Mr. Fring.

457
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,523
You're very welcome.
Men like your husband...

458
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:40,526
...are the thin blue line
between us and these animals.

459
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,027
I only wish I could do more.

460
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,827
Well, we do appreciate your support.

461
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:54,456
This reward could turn the tide here.
It'll really help.

462
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,544
Again,
I can't express how sorry I am.

463
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,005
As it happens,
I actually met Agent Schrader.

464
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,218
- Really?
- Our fund run, couple of months ago.

465
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,388
Mr. Fring was one of our sponsors.

466
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:13,100
I talked for a few minutes
with your husband.

467
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,230
As a matter of fact,
Mr. White, your name came up.

468
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,859
Really?

469
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:26,530
Yeah, there happened to be
a collection jar out for you...

470
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,450
...and we spoke briefly
about your health concerns.

471
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,703
I hope that there's been good news.

472
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,750
Things have improved, yes.

473
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,127
That's wonderful to hear.

474
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,714
It was clear to me
how deeply he cares for you.

475
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:49,928
Well, I have taken up
enough of your time.

476
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,809
Thank you again very much.
It was a great pleasure to meet you.

477
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,062
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

478
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,442
- Let me walk you out.
- Oh, no, it's not necessary.

479
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,945
It's amazing.

480
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:12,117
You know, I didn't say thank you.

481
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,162
I'll walk him out. Be right back.

482
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,793
Good to see you.
Enjoy the chicken?

483
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,629
- Good. Good.
- Excuse me.

484
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:27,174
My pleasure. My pleasure.

485
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,926
Thank you. Thank you.

486
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,969
- It's good chicken, huh? Good.
- Yeah.

487
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,305
- Mr. Fring.
- Mr. White.

488
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:36,809
- I just wanted to thank you again.
- It's my pleasure.

489
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:41,063
May I...? May I speak with you?
Just a moment.

490
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,152
You knew.

491
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,989
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

492
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,368
I investigate everyone
with whom I do business.

493
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:57,162
What careful man wouldn't?

494
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:02,292
He is not a problem for us,
for our business.

495
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,507
Your being here is...

496
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,010
Is this some sort of message?

497
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,513
I'm supporting my community.

498
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,391
I hide in plain sight, same as you.

499
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,351
- Are we done?
- No, listen, I...

500
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,896
This attack on my brother-in-law,
I don't understand it.

501
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,023
I don't know what it means.

502
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:29,319
Please,
if you have some knowledge...

503
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,697
...that you could share with me...

504
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,537
I fear for my family.

505
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:40,122
I'm sure they'll be fine.

506
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,042
I am told the assassin that survived
is gravely injured.

507
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,378
It's doubtful he'll live.

508
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,551
Now thank me and shake my hand.

509
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,893
- Thank you. Thank you again.
- You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

510
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,230
Did you hear that?

511
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,570
- We're going up?
- Come on.

512
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,697
What's going on?

513
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,241
What's happening?

514
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:20,078
Starting chest compressions.
One, two, three, four.

515
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,080
- One, two, three...
- Defib?

516
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,167
Patient is in asystole.
Continuing chest compressions.

517
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,252
One, two, three, four.

518
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,796
- Give me a liter of saline.
- I can't get a pulse.

519
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,548
One, two, three, four.

520
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,927
- Still nothing.
- All right, stopping compressions.

521
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,387
- Time?
- Eight forty-three.

522
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,598
Time of death, 20:43.

523
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,770
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

524
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,464
Yes? Juan?

525
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,341
I assume you heard the news.

526
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:17,177
Your man died. I heard.

527
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,972
- It's unfortunate.
- Yeah, unfortunate.

528
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,975
And meanwhile, I have Federales
surrounding my house.

529
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,853
You know what I think, Gustavo?
I think you're behind all this.

530
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,314
Why would I do this?

531
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:32,693
- How would it serve me?
- That's the part I'm trying to figure out.

532
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,028
Go off on your own, maybe.

533
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,197
Would you actually think
that would work?

534
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,158
Juan, you sound like
you're under a lot of stress.

535
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,328
You should call me back when
you're seeing things more clearly.

536
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,122
I see things clear enough.

537
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,834
One DEA gets shot,
all of Washington starts barking.

538
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,169
D.F. Suddenly has to put
on a big show...

539
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,047
...and I wind up with Federales
in my rosebushes.

540
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,966
But just for a while.

541
00:43:56,301 --> 00:44:00,178
Appearances, politics.

542
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,347
Are you still there, Gustavo?

543
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,182
Yes.

544
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:05,642
I'm here.

545
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,353
I'll weather this. I always do.

546
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:10,022
My brother's a police chief.

547
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,858
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

548
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:15,193
And when I get proof...

549
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:18,196
...and the others find out
what you've done...

550
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,408
...maybe we come pay you a visit.

551
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,410
Maybe we can...

552
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:15,253
Skyler. Skyler. Marie. Marie.

553
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,215
Oh, how is he?
Tell me something good.

554
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:21,760
I think he's stable enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

555
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,388
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid it's immediate family only.

556
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,556
- We're all family.
- I understand.

557
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,726
But we have a certain protocol here
that we need...

558
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,354
We're all family.
