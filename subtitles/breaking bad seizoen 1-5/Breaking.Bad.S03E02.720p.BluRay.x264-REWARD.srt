1
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,414
- Good morning, officer.
- Can you turn the music down?

2
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,208
Oh, okay.

3
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,461
Down means off.

4
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,674
You know why I pulled you over
this morning?

5
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,968
Well, I'm pretty sure
I wasn't speeding.

6
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,429
I've been using the cruise control,
so I don't...

7
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,181
No, sir, your windshield.

8
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,477
License and registration, please.

9
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,522
Right.

10
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:35,571
This... This was from Wayfarer 515.

11
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,659
- My house was in the debris field.
- Okay.

12
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,372
And that's what shattered
my windshield...

13
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,083
...some piece of wreckage
from the plane.

14
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,418
I understand.

15
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:56,884
You know of flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.

16
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,470
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.

17
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,056
I was one of the first responders
on the scene.

18
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,726
- Then what are you doing?
- Citing you, sir.

19
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,980
What? What, you don't believe me?

20
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,440
Regardless of how that windshield
was damaged...

21
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,736
...this car is unsafe to drive in
this condition. Stay in the car, please.

22
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,659
Wait. Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.

23
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,996
- I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
- I can get out of my own car.

24
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,914
- Sir, listen...
- No, you listen to me.

25
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,875
It's time for you to listen to me.

26
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,752
- Take a deep breath, calm down.
- This is America, okay?

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,755
- Get back in that car.
- I have rights. You understand that?

28
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,717
At least have the common decency
to hear me out.

29
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,136
- Step back now.
- Did you even hear what I said?

30
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,430
- Sir, calm down.
- You're giving me a ticket?

31
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,932
I told you that my house
was in the debris field.

32
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,852
Do you have the remotest inkling
of what that means?

33
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,897
- Sir, calm down.
- Hellfire rained down on my house...

34
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,398
...where my children sleep!

35
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,651
- I need you to step back now.
- There were body parts in my yard!

36
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,778
- Are you kidding me?!
- Sir, last warning.

37
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,906
- You got two seconds to stand down.
- Or?

38
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,576
- I'm gonna pepper-spray you.
- Pepper-spray me. That is just perfect.

39
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,955
Pepper-spray the man who's expressing
his opinion under the First Amendment!

40
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,484
Lastly a little something from
down El Paso way.

41
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:41,948
Border Patrol came across multiple
homicides just this side of the border.

42
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,202
Truck turns out to be a chicken run
out of Juarez into Laredo.

43
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,537
Border Patrol's been playing
hide-and-seek...

44
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,498
...with these polleros for two years.

45
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,918
But this time, soon as they made it
across, someone hit them.

46
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,503
Hit them hard.

47
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:59,173
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
No sign of the shooters.

48
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,676
So this truck was carrying more
than just people.

49
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,886
What are we looking at,
weed, coke or meth?

50
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,889
No, doesn't look like
they were transporting narcotics.

51
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,933
Why'd the Border Patrol
kick this to us?

52
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,060
They didn't. I pulled it.

53
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:15,106
You ask me, this is high-end
cartel work. Los Zetas, maybe.

54
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,484
Question is, why do we have
Juarez-style action...

55
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,569
...on our side of the DMZ?

56
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,114
They sending a message?
Clearing a path?

57
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,118
Or was this about stopping
one particular border-hopper?

58
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:31,163
Maybe one of those extra-crispies
knew something he shouldn't.

59
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,541
Anyway, keep your eyes open.

60
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,710
All right, that's it. Slow news day.

61
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,878
Add one more to the countdown.

62
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,714
Oh, yeah? What's that, Gomey?

63
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,216
We're waiting on that famous
blue meth of yours.

64
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,052
Twenty-nine days since
we saw it last.

65
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,097
It's still out there, Gomey.
Don't worry.

66
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,433
Local P.D. I gotta take this.

67
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,226
Gomey, go beat your piñata.

68
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,479
Rest of you jokers,
too damn quiet in here.

69
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,690
Catch some bad guys.

70
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,650
Schrader.

71
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,861
Hey, what's up, Walt?

72
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,613
What?

73
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,247
Jesse?

74
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,709
Hey, Dad.

75
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,672
- Fixing up the house, huh?
- Doing a little work, yeah.

76
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:09,470
Well, I'll bounce. It's cool.

77
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,516
You doing okay?

78
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,018
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

79
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:20,523
I just happened to be driving by
and saw the sign.

80
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,567
So you're selling the place.

81
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,613
In this market. Can you believe it?

82
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,534
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.

83
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,328
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.

84
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,664
We did all new stucco,
all new master suite...

85
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:40,000
...sandblasted,
fumigated the basement.

86
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,754
Right on.

87
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,257
Yeah.

88
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:50,010
You know, fixing up the place
totally increases resale value.

89
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:54,306
I read that in, I wanna say,
like TIME magazine.

90
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,061
So, what'd you do
with the upstairs bathroom?

91
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,064
All redone. New tiles
in the bathrooms and kitchens...

92
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:06,485
...granite countertops, new appliances.
All top-of-the line.

93
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,198
Damn. That's great, Dad.
Think I can get a tour?

94
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:16,662
These guys are trying to finish up.
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.

95
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,293
There are pictures on the website,
if you want to take a look.

96
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,548
Cool.

97
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,758
You're looking healthy.

98
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,720
I'll tell your mother. She'll be happy.

99
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,766
Thanks.

100
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:43,772
You know, I could come by sometime
for dinner or something.

101
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,860
Yeah. Sometime.

102
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,032
Okay.

103
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,159
Later, Dad.

104
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:12,134
You know, look,
he's a high-school teacher.

105
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,970
He's never been in trouble
a day in his life.

106
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,097
He finds out he's got lung cancer...

107
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:21,143
...and now his wife kicks
the poor bastard out of his own house.

108
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:27,733
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates
a little slack, here's the guy.

109
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:40,996
Hey, Walt.
Remember Officer Cavanaugh?

110
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:51,090
Officer, I'm very sorry that
I lost my temper.

111
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,929
There's no excuse for my behavior.
It was disrespectful.

112
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,936
Yeah. Thanks, man.

113
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,291
She's divorcing me.

114
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,088
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.

115
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,133
It is what it is.

116
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,680
She doesn't want me to see the kids.

117
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,852
She said that?

118
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,730
Yeah.

119
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,463
You don't write, you don't call.

120
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,969
God.

121
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,389
It's a disaster.

122
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,352
- It is not a disaster.
- Oh, okay.

123
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,562
It's not a disaster, all right?

124
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,982
She's not going to the cops,
she's not gonna tell a living soul.

125
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:37,988
You wanna know why?
One word: Blowback.

126
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:43,369
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster,
for her.

127
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:48,791
That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed.
You were right under his nose.

128
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,753
He'll be lucky if they let him
bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.

129
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,422
The kids? Paging Dr. Phil.

130
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,885
My daddy's a drug dealer
and my mommy turned him in.

131
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:04,598
And the house? Gone. Feds would
RICO her and the kids out on the street.

132
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:09,144
Good luck arguing with them on that.
No. It's not gonna happen.

133
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,191
She's bluffing and she knows it.

134
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:24,284
Her going to the police
is not the point, Saul.

135
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,538
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?

136
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:32,626
I've lost my family.
Everything that I care about.

137
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:37,005
Hey, buddy.

138
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,468
- It's bad. It's a calamity.
- Oh, my God.

139
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,847
But we live to fight another day.

140
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:49,143
And after a decent interval of time...

141
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,438
...well, there are other fish
in the sea.

142
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,442
You've been out of circulation
for a while.

143
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,611
You'll be just amazed at
what's out there.

144
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,239
Thailand, the Czech Republic.

145
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:07,744
I mean, those women are so grateful
to even be here.

146
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,041
In the meantime,
idle hands are the devil's plaything.

147
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:18,380
So why don't you get back on the horse
and do what you do best?

148
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:22,634
First step:
Talk to our friend and get cooking.

149
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,769
I can't be the bad guy.

150
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,898
What?

151
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,194
I can't be the bad guy.

152
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,825
Okay.

153
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:52,456
You know, we'll revisit.

154
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:59,379
Just promise me
you won't hang yourself in the closet.

155
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,038
Pop-pop!

156
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,792
Pop-pop, the ice cream man!

157
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:48,053
- Don't tell your mom.
- Okay.

158
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,940
- Yeah.
- It's me. We may have a wife problem.

159
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,776
Look, I need eyes on it.

160
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,988
You got an address?

161
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,468
Hey. Dinner's gonna be late.

162
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,264
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie
are bringing takeout...

163
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,143
...but if you're hungry,
I could rustle something up.

164
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,382
Hey, buddy,
pass the ketchup, will you?

165
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,938
What? I've had enough trans-fat
for one lifetime.

166
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,940
Two-day drive
from the nearest ocean...

167
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,652
...and you're eating raw fish.
That's all I'm saying.

168
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,657
Been awhile since that minnow's
been swimming. Right, buddy?

169
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,786
Yeah.

170
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,706
You know, Flynn here is looking
for a part-time job...

171
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,959
...so, I don't know, if you know of
anything you might want to...

172
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,379
My name's Walter Jr.

173
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,716
Like, what,
you can't even say his name?

174
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:53,053
If you've changed your mind
about being called Flynn...

175
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,973
...all you need to do is just tell me
that you don't want to be called Flynn.

176
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,518
Dad didn't even show up
till fourth period.

177
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,688
And his eyes were all red,
like he's been crying or something.

178
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,941
But you, you don't even care!

179
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,486
And now he won't even
drive me home.

180
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:14,032
He won't say why, but I know
it's because you told him not to.

181
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,493
- Honey, I...
- What?

182
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,204
I don't know what your problem is.

183
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:24,334
You may not love him anymore,
but I do.

184
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:29,339
I mean, why you gotta be...?
Why you gotta be such a bitch?!

185
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,258
- Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
- Oh, God.

186
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:34,761
- You can't talk to your mom like that.
- Hank, no. Hank. Hank, it's...

187
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,472
It's all right.

188
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,143
Hey, hey.

189
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:47,023
Skyler, I know that you must have
your reasons for all of this.

190
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,570
Sky, the...

191
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,907
I know it's none of my business...

192
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,871
...but keeping Walt from the kids?
I mean...

193
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,920
You're right, Hank.

194
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,924
It's none of your business.

195
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,808
Oh, my God. After all of that?

196
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,603
Please, tell me
that you are still not curious.

197
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,522
- There's nothing to be curious about.
- Oh, please.

198
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,525
The day I heard the words
"second cell phone," I knew.

199
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:34,029
- Believe me. Seen it a hundred times.
- Okay. All right.

200
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,032
So, what? Stop dancing around it.

201
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,868
What is it exactly that you have seen
a hundred times?

202
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,620
Please, please, enlighten me.

203
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,416
Look, a guy like Walt?
Nice guy, decent, smart.

204
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:50,128
But, let's face it, underachiever,
dead-end life, okay?

205
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,465
He gets cancer. Time's running out.
Mid-life crisis.

206
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,426
He acts up. He steps out.

207
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:00,680
And the wife, she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.

208
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:05,227
Look, do the math, Marie.
It only comes out one way.

209
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:10,690
Knowing Walt, he felt so guilty,
he probably told her himself.

210
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,026
I... I don't know.

211
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:17,781
I think if he cheated on her,
that she would have told me by now.

212
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:23,119
It just feels like something more.

213
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:34,464
Yes, yes, yes, 24/7 coverage.
Need you ask?

214
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,216
How much is this gonna run me?

215
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,387
Jesus, I'm in the wrong business.

216
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,014
Yeah, I'll call you.

217
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,892
Return of the prodigal,
back to the land of the living.

218
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,602
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.

219
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,398
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster. Am I right?

220
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:56,111
Unencumbered young man
with stacks of cash.

221
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:01,741
Hey, I'm jealous.
Hand to God, I'm jealous.

222
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:06,621
Speaking of cash, you know
what's giving me heartburn lately?

223
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,834
Your former partner. This guy,
he works like a bastard, right?

224
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,627
Builds a business single-handed.

225
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:17,132
Finally the big money shows up
and what does he do? He walks out.

226
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,470
Talent like that and he flushes
it down the crapper.

227
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,891
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.

228
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,519
Look, I know you're out of it
and all...

229
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,980
...but you wouldn't talk to him,
would you?

230
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,024
Help him pull his head
out of his ass?

231
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,735
All right, all right, scratch that.

232
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,071
Yeah, he won't listen to me,
he's not gonna listen to you.

233
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,991
All due respect.

234
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,037
You want a job?

235
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,247
A job?

236
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,335
- Who's got a job for me?
- I do.

237
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,790
There you go.

238
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,130
- Hey.
- Hey.

239
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,714
Thought I'd...

240
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,342
...well, visit, if you don't mind.
- Of course not.

241
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,303
- You don't need the room, do you?
- No, no, no.

242
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,640
I just needed some more space
to spread out.

243
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,642
Wanted to say hello to little Holly.

244
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:43,857
Hey, girl. Hi, baby. Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay. Oh, yeah.

245
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,359
She's a beauty. Look at her.

246
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:50,738
Hey, thanks for being so flexible
on me coming in.

247
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:55,994
I just wish we had you back full-time.
You do brighten up the place.

248
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:02,959
Listen, believe me, this is...

249
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:06,754
I don't want to bring this up,
but I can't sign off on these quarterlies.

250
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,091
I'm sorry, I just can't.

251
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,929
Is that right?

252
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,270
If you're gonna do this,
it can't be so glaring.

253
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,024
Glaring.

254
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,193
Okay.

255
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:34,490
That does sound bad.
Show me what's bothering you.

256
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,041
Keller.

257
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:49,422
Again. Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.

258
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,217
Revenue with no backup.

259
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:57,305
Here, here and here.
I don't even know what to say.

260
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,898
Yeah.

261
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,694
Yeah, well, okay.
This is fixable, right?

262
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:16,324
How about if I just push 28,800...

263
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:22,038
...out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?

264
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:32,882
I'm just saying I can't sign it
as it currently exists.

265
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,968
Fair enough.

266
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,011
I'll take care of it.

267
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,264
Thank you for the heads-up.

268
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:42,475
You won't have to deal with this again,
I swear.

269
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,688
What if your kids found out?

270
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:55,363
- If my kids found out?
- This. What you're doing.

271
00:26:55,531 --> 00:27:00,076
Someday they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?

272
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,916
Well, put me on the spot,
why don't you?

273
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,878
I guess maybe I'd...

274
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:15,008
I'd say that I might have feet of clay...

275
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,635
...but that whatever I did,
I did thinking of them.

276
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,389
You know, trying to provide.

277
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:26,311
And I'd ask them to try
to take the time to understand...

278
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,275
You know what? Truth is,
I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.

279
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,611
I'm just trying to keep my head
above water, so...

280
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,781
I'd better get back to it.

281
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,667
Oh, God.

282
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,212
Hi, Walt.

283
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,050
Listen, I can't tal...
I'm at work right now...

284
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,718
What?

285
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,804
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.

286
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,056
No, no, no, of course.

287
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,767
No, he's not staying.
He understands that.

288
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,604
- I'll bring him anywhere you want.
- Dad.

289
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:12,982
Well, yeah. It is rush hour.

290
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,652
I mean, I could fight traffic
and bring him down to Beneke now.

291
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,155
But wouldn't it be easier if we...?

292
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:23,701
Right, okay, good.
So we'll meet you at the house.

293
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,870
Okay, bye.

294
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,331
Why are you doing this?

295
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:33,753
She's just trying to keep me from
seeing you and you're helping her.

296
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:40,468
Well, son, I mean, your mother,
she has her reasons.

297
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,637
What reasons?

298
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,849
They're...

299
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,811
Well, they're...

300
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,690
Well, they're just a little difficult
to delineate.

301
00:28:54,858 --> 00:29:01,072
But, I mean, yes, there are two sides
to every story, always.

302
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,534
But she...

303
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,121
Yeah.

304
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:14,794
This is just how it has to be
for now, okay?

305
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:19,757
Now, look, your home is your home
and that is where you belong, all right?

306
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:24,220
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it's your house.

307
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,180
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie...

308
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:30,268
...everybody knows
that you haven't done anything wrong.

309
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:34,188
Everybody is on your side.

310
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:42,864
Well, it's not about taking sides,
though.

311
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,742
- How can you let her treat you like this?
- Come on.

312
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:51,247
- How can you just take it?
- Now just listen to me, okay?

313
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:55,626
No matter what, all of this has nothing
to do with how we feel about you, okay?

314
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,797
We both love you very,
very much, okay?

315
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:04,093
You and your sister will
come first always.

316
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,722
Come on.

317
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:16,063
Let's try to see this
in a positive light, okay? Both of us.

318
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,442
Let's just buck up.

319
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:22,945
And I'll take you home.

320
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:31,704
Let me first just
hit the old bathroom here.

321
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,599
Hello. Good afternoon.

322
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,227
- Nice to meet you. Saul Goodman.
- Nice to meet you.

323
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:58,064
You're not that lawyer
on late-night television, are you?

324
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:00,441
Better call Saul!

325
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,569
I get it all the time.

326
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:08,241
We're here to discuss the sale of
the property at 9809 Margo.

327
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,827
I get it. Flat-fee clients, am I right?

328
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,747
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.

329
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:18,543
I represent a client
who shall remain nameless.

330
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,253
However, for our purposes...

331
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,798
...you might just as well visualize
a large bag of money.

332
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:28,261
This individual wants
to buy your house today for cash.

333
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,222
- Cash?
- Cash. I know, in this economy.

334
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,225
The money is already burning a hole
in my client's account.

335
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,728
You can ask Mr. Gardiner. I've shown
him all the pertinent financials.

336
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,439
It's the only reason
we're sitting here.

337
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,735
Fair enough. We get a few papers
signed and notarized...

338
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,737
...we can take care of this right now.

339
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,782
In fact, I could wire you your money
this very afternoon.

340
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,578
There's just one little hair
in the soup.

341
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,788
The price.

342
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,545
We feel 875 is very fair.

343
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:06,007
But I suppose there's always
a little wiggle room.

344
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:12,263
Well, why don't you wiggle us on down
to 400 and you got yourselves a deal?

345
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,225
Four hundred thousand?
What is that, a joke?

346
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,436
No, that's my offer.

347
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,855
That's less than half-price.

348
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,107
We put that much
into the renovations alone.

349
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,067
Why don't we just cut
the clown act...

350
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:28,321
...and you tell us what you're willing
to come up to?

351
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,157
Four hundred thousand.
That's my final offer.

352
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,658
- Waste of time.
- Ridiculous.

353
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,286
How could you possibly imagine
we'd entertain this?

354
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,829
- Come on, hon.
- I don't know.

355
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,333
I thought some allowance was in order
once I heard about the meth lab.

356
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,043
That used to be in the basement.

357
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,296
I looked over your signed disclosure
statements...

358
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,923
...and I don't see any mention
of a meth lab. Nope.

359
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,385
Oh, you got your termite inspection.
That's good.

360
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,970
But no meth lab.

361
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:58,684
Now, some would call that fraud
in service of concealing a felony.

362
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:04,231
I, myself, am more open-minded.
But it is tricky.

363
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,692
Now, don't get me wrong.
I applaud your cojones.

364
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,569
I mean, good try...

365
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:12,073
...at sneaking a meth-contaminated
property past a buyer.

366
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,868
I mean, could've been a good deal
for you. Too bad.

367
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:21,499
Now, I could file a suit and encumber
this property indefinitely.

368
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,918
Or I could start some criminal
proceedings.

369
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:27,213
But I don't think any of us want that,
now, do we?

370
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:30,883
How about it, counselor?
Do you concur?

371
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,781
There you go, son.

372
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,577
Come on. It's not Devil's Island.

373
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,168
Okay.

374
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,723
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

375
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,523
- Brought pizza.
- Yeah. Well, I'm making dinner.

376
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:33,279
Okay, I'll just put it in the fridge.
It's even better the next day.

377
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:37,700
Hi, honey.

378
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,330
Sorry.

379
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,919
Skyler.

380
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:55,009
I mean, what kind of example do
we want to set here, right?

381
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:59,430
I mean, can't we at least just sit down
and eat a piece of pizza together?

382
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,475
Just hash things out like adults?

383
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:08,314
We have discussed everything
we need to discuss.

384
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:11,400
I thought I made myself very clear.

385
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,323
I got dipping sticks.

386
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,490
You've reached Walt's
temporary number.

387
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,492
Please, leave a message.

388
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,748
When I went out this morning
to get the newspaper...

389
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,960
...I saw a pizza on our roof.

390
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,796
Would you know anything about that?

391
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:59,258
Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.

392
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:04,221
Calm down, accept the situation
and keep your distance.

393
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:09,101
If you can't manage that,
I will get a restraining order.

394
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,403
Skyler. Skyler.

395
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:24,533
Got your restraining order right here!
Restrain this!

396
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,300
Breaking even is not so bad.

397
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:44,553
In this economy, a lot of people
would kill to break even.

398
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:50,601
Poor Jake. He had his heart set
on going to Space Camp.

399
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:53,854
Oh, no.

400
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,691
Oh, God. This is all we need.

401
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:02,988
Hey, Mom, Dad. How's it going?

402
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:07,242
Jesse, it's really not a good time.

403
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:08,911
Come on.

404
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:12,039
Jesse, the house has been sold.

405
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,208
The new owners are expected
at any moment.

406
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,877
- Where do you think you're going?
- Inside.

407
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,798
I bought the place.

408
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,022
Be back by seven, okay?

409
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,024
Love you.

410
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,323
Bye.

411
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,183
No!

412
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:01,935
Oh, God.

413
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,633
It's me. There's something
he should know about.

414
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,387
Hold on.
