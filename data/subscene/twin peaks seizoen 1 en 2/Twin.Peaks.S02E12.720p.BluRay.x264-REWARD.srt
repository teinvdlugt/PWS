1
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:12,840
Mr. Horne?

2
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,012
Your secretary said to come in.

3
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,014
Bobby Briggs.

4
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,767
Bobby, you know
what you have to have in this life?

5
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,310
Hmm?

6
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,480
Balance.

7
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,483
Distance.

8
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,403
Symmetry.

9
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,286
Look.

10
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,540
It's a beautiful thing, isn't it? Hmm?

11
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,756
Uh, Mr. Horne, did you listen
to that tape that I sent you?

12
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,758
Yes, I listened to your tape, Bobby.

13
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:01,597
Frankly, I am surprised
that Leo could master the technology.

14
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,978
Damn it, Bobby,
what do you want? Huh?

15
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,191
Mr. Horne,
I have a great admiration for you.

16
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,569
Admiration is for poets
and dairy cows, Bobby.

17
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:19,990
I don't know what you mean. I, uh...

18
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,409
Bobby.

19
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:30,042
You're standing in front
of a mammoth skyscraper.

20
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,837
A leviathan that rips a hole
in the clouds.

21
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,841
Now, what's the first question
that comes to your mind?

22
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,138
Um...

23
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,978
The first question that you ask yourself
is, "What's on the top floor?"

24
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,899
"Who's up there in the penthouse,
and why?"

25
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,485
Now, that's who I am.

26
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,988
Are you?

27
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:06,078
Yeah, of course I am. Yes.

28
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:14,586
Bobby, opportunity knocks.

29
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:23,387
I want you to follow Hank Jennings.

30
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:27,099
I want you to chronicle
his existence.

31
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,728
Show me something
that I don't already know.

32
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,786
Hmm.

33
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,705
I'd like to see both.

34
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:53,125
Very good. Which one
would you like to see first?

35
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,919
Well...

36
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,813
What is this?

37
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,649
I'd thought I'd taken that out.

38
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,111
That property
is called Dead Dog Farm.

39
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,822
And it's worse than it sounds.

40
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,199
- What is it?
- A puzzle.

41
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,869
No one ever really stays there long.

42
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,787
When can I see it?

43
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,251
Sorry I'm late.

44
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,879
But the little nipper is so excited
about our camping trip,

45
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,465
I just couldn't coax him
out of the car. Heh.

46
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,300
Richard, this is Judy Swain

47
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,136
from the Happy Helping Hands
organization.

48
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,804
I'm little Nicky's case manager.

49
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,599
Charmed, I'm sure. Shall we?

50
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,809
Sit down.

51
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,853
Okay. Ahem.

52
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,104
Um...

53
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,649
As I was about to tell your,
uh, friends,

54
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,861
the number one thing
to know about Nicky

55
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:08,533
is that throughout his brief life,
he has been very confused,

56
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:14,289
and perhaps traumatized
by a persistent random misfortune.

57
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,876
Looks like he's bounced around
quite a bit.

58
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,336
Well, yes, he has.

59
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,630
- Poor child.
- Yes.

60
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,173
An orphan, you know.

61
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,759
Really? What happened?
Did his parents die?

62
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,304
Nicely deduced, Andrew.

63
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,765
Persistent random misfortune?

64
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,975
Uh, they were killed.

65
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,895
How were they killed, Miss Swain?

66
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,980
Mysterious circumstances.

67
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:43,318
I'm afraid the, uh, orphanage has never
provided us with that information.

68
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,948
Andy, let's go.
Emergency up at the Great Northern.

69
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,591
Looks like a heart attack.

70
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:11,096
Once stimulated,
the female will respond in such a way

71
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,891
that the skin around her...
Oh, my God.

72
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,769
Looks like Dougie went out
with his boots on.

73
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:22,816
Love Poems of Lord Byron,
The Kama Sutra,

74
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,068
Hookers and Handmaidens.

75
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,362
Sheriff, look at this.

76
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,121
What a falling out was here.

77
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,047
Doug.

78
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:52,220
Lord, I hate to say it, I told you so.

79
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,607
Here, sheriff.

80
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,110
This is it.

81
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,404
The murder weapon.

82
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:14,159
She might as well
have blown his brains out with a rifle.

83
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,837
He never could say no to a woman.

84
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,388
You old fool.

85
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:54,908
You sexual adventuress,
you'll burn in hell for this.

86
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:59,454
- Take it easy, mister.
- I'm gonna shout till I wake the dead.

87
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,957
She murdered my brother.

88
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,876
She's a witch.

89
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,005
He's right, I'm cursed.

90
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,507
Don't be silly.

91
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,302
No, no, it's true.

92
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:19,683
It all started in high school,
prom night.

93
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,811
My date went to kiss me.

94
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,565
It was his first day
with his new braces.

95
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,110
Oh, and they gleamed
in the moonlight.

96
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,824
And his rubber band snapped
and his jaw locked open,

97
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,451
and we ended up
in the emergency room,

98
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,122
and the doctors had to break his jaw
in three places to get it to shut.

99
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,085
And it's just gotten worse ever since.

100
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,087
A curse needs a cure.

101
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,840
I know a bit about these things.

102
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,342
Are you the sheriff?

103
00:09:55,595 --> 00:10:01,558
Let's just say, when something
really big goes down, I'm the man.

104
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,068
Boys, there's a story
about a great football coach,

105
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,654
whose name escapes me
at this time,

106
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:19,159
who was dead set against
having any black players on his team.

107
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:24,748
Until somebody brought him the finest
black halfback anyone had ever seen.

108
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,626
And when what's-his-name
saw him run 50 yards

109
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,419
and no one lay a hand on him,

110
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,173
he shouted, "Look at that Indian go!"

111
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:38,178
That coach accepted
that athlete's desire to compete.

112
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,305
Nadine.

113
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:45,060
And today, this story applies
to this woman's...

114
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,271
This young girl's right to compete.

115
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:53,026
In addition to it being her moral
and constitutional right.

116
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,739
Mike Nelson,
could you step up here for a second?

117
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,661
Come on, Mike, go.

118
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,122
Now, Nadine has chosen
to prove herself to us

119
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,209
by taking on our very best.

120
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,796
Our very own district champion,
Mike Nelson.

121
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,965
- Yeah! Come on. Come on.
- All right, man.

122
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,218
Go, Mike.

123
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,178
Hi, Mike.

124
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,682
- Oh!
- Put your hand here.

125
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,392
No, here.

126
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,269
All right, now just push against me.
I'll try not to hurt you.

127
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,729
Wanna go out tonight?

128
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,940
This is called a tie.

129
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,072
- Oh, yeah.
- You stupid...

130
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,615
What did you say, Mike?

131
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,665
Neck, you're breaking my neck.

132
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,834
You're right,
this is sort of like necking.

133
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,210
Agh.

134
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,132
What about tonight?

135
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,385
Coach?

136
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,972
Hey, coach?

137
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,605
- Get up, Mike.
- Oh, my God.

138
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,067
One, two and three.

139
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,695
Now will you go out with me?

140
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,130
What happened to you?

141
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,591
I got beat up by a girl.

142
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,011
What did you do to her?

143
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,805
Donna, I'm not kidding.
Now, you've gotta help me.

144
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,475
It's bad enough getting stomped on
in front of the whole team,

145
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,893
but she likes me.

146
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,811
- Who?
- Mrs. Hurley.

147
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,689
Nadine?

148
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,691
It's not funny.

149
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,360
I don't know, maybe an older woman
is just what you need.

150
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,363
I don't wanna go out with anyone
who can body-slam me.

151
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,407
Well, what do you want me
to do about it?

152
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,203
I don't know, talk to her or something.
Pretend you're still my girlfriend.

153
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,205
Sorry, Mike,
I'm not that good of an actress.

154
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:14,083
Donna, this is serious.
I'm gonna end up in traction.

155
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,931
May I help you?

156
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,266
Hang up a local service rebellion,

157
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,354
wonder if you'd help me bundle up
loose sticks and burn that master.

158
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:39,108
Malcolm, Malcolm Sloan,
as in brother to Evelyn.

159
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,612
Mr. Marsh's driver, as in,
"Bring that car around, James."

160
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,906
So how badly
did she damage the Jag?

161
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,366
It's repairable.

162
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,829
That's the nice thing about things.

163
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,250
You know, when she and Jeffrey
fell in love,

164
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,168
he gave her a whole new life.

165
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,254
That's for sure.

166
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:05,635
Now I got a nice uniform,
and the keys to the liquor cabinet.

167
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,181
God, I hope
I don't sound ungrateful,

168
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,642
because compared
to the life I was living,

169
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,770
wanton dissipation is a step up.

170
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,730
And Evelyn,
she learned a lot herself.

171
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,484
Defensive postures,
masking bruises, vicious cycles.

172
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,403
What are you talking about?

173
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,781
I'm sorry, am I being obscure?

174
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,951
Once a fortnight,
Jeffrey pounds her mercilessly,

175
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,872
and she tries to get even
by breaking one of his things.

176
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,749
It only perpetuates the cycle.

177
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,252
She's your sister.
Why don't you stop him?

178
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:45,091
Sonny boy,
nobody stops Mr. Marsh.

179
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,469
That's a golden rule around here.

180
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,014
You can jot that down
and put it under your pillow.

181
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,476
I gotta get back.

182
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,814
Hey, thanks.

183
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,317
I mean that.

184
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,643
Well, it's still standing.

185
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,811
Almost by force of habit.

186
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,440
Well, habit can provide
a strong foundation.

187
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,400
Dead Dog Farm, huh?

188
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,695
That's an old legend.
Of all the people in the world,

189
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,907
the best and the worst
are drawn to Dead Dog,

190
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,951
and most turn away.

191
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,162
Only those with the purest of heart
can feel its pain.

192
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:01,417
And somewhere in between,
the rest of us struggle.

193
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,754
Irene, have you shown this property
to anyone else recently?

194
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,508
I don't think anyone's asked
to see it this last year.

195
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,677
There's three vehicles.

196
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,722
A jeep, a four-wheeler
and a luxury sedan.

197
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,230
It's open.

198
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,983
Hello?

199
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:35,660
There's been a meeting here.
In the past few hours.

200
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,340
What are you seeing?

201
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,805
They forgot
there was no running water.

202
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,774
Baby laxative.

203
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,140
- More white powder.
- Mm.

204
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,482
Cocaine.

205
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,861
Irene, we have to notify the sheriff.

206
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,960
Nicky, stop that, please.

207
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,179
Nicky, stop it.

208
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,058
I don't understand this at all.

209
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,728
I just had the car checked
at Gas Farm.

210
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,315
He told me it was
in perfect working order.

211
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,193
Perfect working order.

212
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:38,157
This is all so technical.

213
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:46,207
Please, Nicky,
Uncle Dick is trying to read.

214
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,511
Nicholas, get out of the car!

215
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,014
Nicholas, out of the car, right now!

216
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,725
Out of the car!

217
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,228
Do you hear me?

218
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,441
Are you mad at me, Uncle Dick?

219
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,070
Well, of course I'm not mad at you.
Why should I be mad at you?

220
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,948
- Scared you, didn't I?
- Ha-ha-ha.

221
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,684
Uncle Dick!

222
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,521
Don't worry, don't worry,
I'm all right, little Nicky.

223
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,275
What if you died?
You aren't gonna die, are you?

224
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,070
Of course not. Don't be silly.

225
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,203
Harry?

226
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,788
Cooper. This is Colonel Riley.

227
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,790
He's heading up
the Air Force's investigation

228
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,375
into Briggs' disappearance.

229
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,794
- Colonel.
- Cooper.

230
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,714
You were with Briggs
when we lost our coordinates on him.

231
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,257
Yes, I was.

232
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:22,136
When you were at the site,
did you notice any wildlife in the area?

233
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,514
- Wildlife?
- Birds, owls?

234
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,350
Yes.

235
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:31,687
Yes, just moments before the major
disappeared, I heard an owl.

236
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,023
Any visual contact?

237
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,610
Look, colonel, Garland Briggs
is a good friend of mine.

238
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,154
It would be a lot better
if you'd just level with us.

239
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,449
We know about the monitors
and the messages from deep space

240
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,576
that you received pertaining to me.

241
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:50,581
You may know something,
but you best get your facts straight.

242
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,542
Our monitors are pointed
at deep space,

243
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,422
but the messages we intercepted
that Briggs showed you

244
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,134
were sent from right here
in these woods.

245
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:06,472
Now, where they were sent to
is another question.

246
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:11,143
Might this have something to do
with a place called the White Lodge?

247
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,938
That's classified.

248
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,898
Colonel, we'd like to help you,

249
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,567
but you need to give us
a little more to go on here.

250
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:25,825
Garland Briggs is the best pilot
I've ever known.

251
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:30,121
He was born with hardware
most of us only dream about.

252
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,456
I can tell you this:

253
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:39,547
His disappearance has implications
that go so far beyond national security

254
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,050
the Cold War seems like a case
of the sniffles.

255
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:56,063
The engine's fine,
the axle should be okay.

256
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,484
How did you get so good at this?

257
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,778
Oh, my uncle Ed.

258
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,530
You think I'm good,
you should see him.

259
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,282
He can fix anything.

260
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:12,288
I was, uh, talking to your brother today
a little bit about your situation.

261
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,291
Look, James,
mind your own business.

262
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,045
Are you afraid?

263
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,589
Are you afraid of your husband?

264
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,300
Are you?

265
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,428
There's nothing to talk about.

266
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,224
I know what it's like to be alone.

267
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,118
You are afraid of him, aren't you?

268
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,331
Why don't you just leave?

269
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,250
It's complicated.

270
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,680
Oh, my God, it's him.

271
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,267
I've gotta go.

272
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,857
It's not as bad as I made it out to be.

273
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,264
Oh, look who's here.
Did Daddy have a change of heart?

274
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,475
Daddy just made the smartest decision
that he's made all year.

275
00:23:56,643 --> 00:24:00,271
Oh, yeah? That's not saying much.
What did he do?

276
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,940
- He put me on the payroll.
- Ha-ha-ha.

277
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,068
Bobby, you junior achiever, you.

278
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,570
And, uh, this right here?

279
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,656
- This is my first assignment.
- Ah.

280
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,742
Anything I can help you with?

281
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,369
Maybe.

282
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:20,916
Maybe you can help me celebrate

283
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,127
after I show this to the boss.

284
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,046
Well, you know what I think,
Bobby Briggs?

285
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,923
Tell.

286
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,802
I think that we should think

287
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,432
about doing business together.

288
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,149
Audrey, I like the way you think.

289
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,859
Thank you.

290
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,133
Hey, Mr. Horne, how's it going?

291
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,767
What, uh...? What is this
you're doing here, exactly?

292
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,437
Gettysburg, day one.

293
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,856
The South is winning.

294
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,861
I followed Hank,
got those pictures you wanted.

295
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,874
You see, I don't know what he's up to,
but I'm sure it's no good.

296
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,709
I mean, I've never seen
these guys before,

297
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,963
but they're not exactly from the Rotary,
if you know what I mean.

298
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:52,883
- I like you, Bobby.
- Oh, I like you too.

299
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,635
How much am I paying you?

300
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,428
Uh...

301
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,598
We haven't actually
discussed money.

302
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,476
Well, you can consider this
your first raise.

303
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:07,439
Now, you come back tomorrow,
and we will discuss a full-time position.

304
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:13,904
Thank you, Ben.
I won't let you down.

305
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,498
Oh!

306
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:31,130
Nectar of the gods, my dear.

307
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,511
It's the bubbles.

308
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:45,477
Wine comes in at the mouth.

309
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,732
Love comes in at the eye.

310
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:56,780
I touch my glass to my lips,
I look at you and sigh.

311
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,074
Thank you, Pete.

312
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,201
That's very lyrical.

313
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,454
It's Yeats.

314
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,415
He's a poet.

315
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:10,294
Yes, I know.

316
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,964
The only other toast I know
is a limerick.

317
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,133
No, really. Really, Pete, that was...

318
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:21,138
- There once was a lady from Galway...
- Josie!

319
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:29,688
- Yes.
- We'll have our appetizers now.

320
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,358
- Yes.
- Oh, Josie.

321
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,859
I just want you to know

322
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:38,030
that even though your station
in this household has changed,

323
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:42,826
I intend to show you all the respect
and affection that you deserve.

324
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:49,792
Thank you, Catherine.
And I will try to do the same.

325
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,003
Oh, and put on your little maid's cap.

326
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:02,388
Catherine, uh, don't you think maybe
you're being a little hard on her?

327
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,599
I mean, she is still part of the family.

328
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,352
Josie had a hand in Andrew's death,

329
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,314
and she did everything in her power
to destroy me.

330
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,900
She is lucky she's not hanging
from a tree.

331
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,362
I don't believe it.

332
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,699
Not the Josie I know.

333
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:27,579
I would like to propose a toast
to Ben Horne's double-cross.

334
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,791
Here's to Josie Packard's
dirty deeds.

335
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:35,129
And here's to the woman
who brought them down.

336
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,841
Here's to me.

337
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,471
Here's to you, poodle.

338
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,353
Diane, I'm holding in my hand
a nationally distributed newspaper.

339
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,106
My opening move, responding
to Windom Earle's opening move,

340
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,609
was printed in the personal columns
per my instructions.

341
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:03,282
But I've already received
his response to this yesterday.

342
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,619
He anticipated my response
to his opening move perfectly.

343
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,914
He's toying with me, Diane.

344
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,420
I wonder where he is
and what he's planning.

345
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,049
Meanwhile,
I've spent the past two days

346
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,761
without badge and gun
the best way I know how:

347
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,972
Occupying both body and spirit.

348
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,682
Looked into some real estate,

349
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,770
what the local agent
charitably refers to as a fixer-upper.

350
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,189
Nonetheless, it's a place
where a man might make a home,

351
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,608
raise a family, which is something,
in spite of my past,

352
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,735
I still hope I'm able to do.

353
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,906
However, as is the case here
in Twin Peaks,

354
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:47,701
even this bucolic hideaway
is filled with secrets.

355
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,497
Secrets that may be connected
to my trouble at the Bureau

356
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:54,958
and the cocaine that was found
in my automobile.

357
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,671
Agent Hardy's deliberations
will soon be completed.

358
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,840
And if I'm not adequately able
to defend myself,

359
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,135
there's a very real possibility
of imprisonment.

360
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,529
- Hello, Agent Cooper.
- Audrey.

361
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,830
This is for you. I stole it.

362
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,250
Don't you think
you'd better give it back?

363
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,627
Not until you look at what's inside.

364
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,964
Okay.

365
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,716
What am I gonna find
in here, Audrey?

366
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,678
Pictures my father paid for.

367
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,688
I did good, didn't I?

368
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,275
Audrey, you did better than good.

369
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,776
You may have saved my life.

370
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,904
Good.

371
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,827
So that makes us even now, right?

372
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,086
- Denise.
- Hi, Coop.

373
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,755
Come in.

374
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,508
Sorry, am I interrupting something?

375
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,386
Special Agent Denise Bryson,
Drug Enforcement Agency.

376
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,472
This is a very good friend of mine,
Audrey Horne.

377
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,643
They have women agents?

378
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,937
More or less.

379
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:43,400
Audrey, if you'll excuse us.
Agency business.

380
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,277
I thought you were suspended.

381
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,738
I am.

382
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,908
Thanks again. Good night.

383
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:57,205
Thank you. Heh.
You're welcome. Ha, ha.

384
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,509
These are photographs
of an abandoned property

385
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,553
on the outskirts of town.

386
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,889
Jean Renault, Hank Jennings,

387
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,100
Norma Jennings' stepfather,
Sergeant King, mounted police.

388
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,561
They were at the scene
earlier today.

389
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:24,524
In the kitchen I found traces of cocaine
and the baby laxative used to step it up.

390
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,361
I think if you compare this,
which was taken from the farm,

391
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,364
with the stuff found in my automobile,
you'll find it to be a match.

392
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,574
- That's good news, Coop.
- Yeah.

393
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,452
Now, can we talk about something
more important?

394
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,497
Exactly how old is that girl?

395
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,250
Denise, I would assume
you're no longer interested in girls.

396
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:45,420
Coop, I may be wearing a dress,

397
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:49,549
but I still pull my panties on one leg
at a time, if you know what I mean.

398
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,510
Not really.

399
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:01,395
You gonna eat that pie
or just push it around on my china?

400
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,147
I guess I ain't all that hungry.

401
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,732
Wanna talk about it?

402
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,985
Oh, you don't wanna hear
my problems.

403
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,697
We used to talk about everything.

404
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,409
We can still talk, Ed.

405
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,163
Remember when we were kids,
all those plans we made?

406
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,792
It was like, uh, we were just waiting
around for our lives to begin,

407
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,295
planning all that stuff we'd do
when we did.

408
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:31,049
Somehow, life starts
before you know it.

409
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,802
Suddenly, you're halfway through
living it, and all those plans,

410
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,179
they just don't mean a damn thing.

411
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,559
This is my life, Norma.
I just don't like it much.

412
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,777
We can make new plans.

413
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,545
Andrew.

414
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,715
What is it, Dick?

415
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,842
May I have a word with you?

416
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,011
Sure.

417
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,096
I feel we may have a problem.

418
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,473
What problem?

419
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,433
It's our mutual friend, little Nicky.

420
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,561
- Yes?
- How shall I put this?

421
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,731
Well, he's, he's...

422
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,651
Andy, I believe that little Nicky,
incredible as it may seem,

423
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,653
may in fact be the devil.

424
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,489
Devil?

425
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:39,451
Or at the very least,
homicidal in the first degree.

426
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,830
Andy, we've got to find out
what happened to his parents.

427
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,797
I've got the, uh, autopsy report.

428
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:56,384
Dwayne, Dougie died
of natural causes. Heart attack.

429
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,345
No evidence of foul play.

430
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,472
Hmm. Mm-mm.

431
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,101
Did you check him
for witchcraft? Uh-huh.

432
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:09,648
That's, uh, not the kind of thing
that shows up in an autopsy.

433
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,236
I wanna press charges.

434
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,196
Now, Dwayne, you know
I can't press charges

435
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,614
if there hasn't been a crime.

436
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:21,076
Well, she killed him with sex.

437
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:25,372
And how much clearer
does it have to be?

438
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,041
Dwayne, it's been a long, hard day.

439
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:32,003
Why don't you just go home
and try and get some rest.

440
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,631
You want me to go to sleep.

441
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:40,554
Not until that murdering hussy
is behind bars, where she belongs.

442
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:44,516
I'll sue her, I'll file civil suits.

443
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:48,061
She'll not get her hands
on any of Dougie's money

444
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,813
as long as I have a breath.

445
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:54,818
Not one single red cent. Nothing.

446
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,655
I'll... I'll...

447
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:04,327
Harry, do you still have
that bottle of Irish in your office?

448
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,039
I wanna put some in a little warm milk
for the widow Milford.

449
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,628
O, she doth teach the torches
to burn bright.

450
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,841
It seems she hangs
against the cheek of night

451
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,845
like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear.

452
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:28,643
Beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.

453
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:03,261
Twin Peaks Sheriff Station,
this is Lucy speaking.

454
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,931
One moment, please.

455
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,351
Sheriff Truman?

456
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,229
Sheriff?

457
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,113
Sheriff Truman.

458
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:26,701
Sheriff Truman,
you have a telephone call, line three.

459
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,750
One moment, please.

460
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,966
Huh.

461
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,569
So wait, it gets better.
And then I said:

462
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,197
"Well, what do you think
underpants are for, anyway?"

463
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,994
Tell us another one.
Please, another. One more.

464
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,038
This one time, I had this cousin.

465
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,666
He was a clown
in this rodeo, you know.

466
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:19,838
They just had all these
really big horses, you know.

467
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:23,091
And you will not believe
what they made him do.

468
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,509
- What?
- What?

469
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,344
They made him... Thank you.

470
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,638
- They made him stand in the middle,
TRUMAN: Yeah.

471
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:32,976
And take his clown costume
completely off.

472
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,881
Can I help you?

473
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,718
Mr. Niles, I don't wanna put
the squeeze on you.

474
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,595
You've been to prison,

475
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,639
I don't need to paint you
any pictures.

476
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,268
What's this all about?

477
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:20,065
For starters, you're guilty
of a serious parole violation.

478
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,608
Ugh.

479
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,735
Enough to put you back inside.

480
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,863
And unless you cooperate,

481
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:33,453
I intend to do everything in my power
to make sure you stay there.

482
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,248
My name is Ernie Niles,
and I confess.

483
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,666
I'm guilty.

484
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,961
I guess I'm terribly guilty,
against my will, of course.

485
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,464
Mr. Niles,
we're not really interested in all the...

486
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,174
They held me at gunpoint,
they beat me,

487
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,009
they threatened me
with physical violence.

488
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,053
These men are animals,
they'll stop at nothing.

489
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,262
Mr. Niles, just...

490
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,931
They wanted me
to sell drugs for them.

491
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,893
I tried to resist,
but my family means everything to me.

492
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:01,648
My family... When they threatened
my wife, well, I weakened, you know.

493
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,608
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

494
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:07,070
I guess I did wrong but, you know,

495
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,907
love makes a guy do foolish things,
you know, illegal things...

496
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,076
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie, will you shut up?

497
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,495
Mr. Niles, we appreciate the trials
you've been through,

498
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,913
we sympathize with you.

499
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,706
- You do?
- That's why we're here.

500
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,875
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

501
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,919
Now tell us everything you know.

502
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,588
Yes, this is, uh...
Well, they tortured me,

503
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,091
and the thing was,
they did filthy, horrible...

504
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,592
Mr. Niles, please.

505
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,971
Just the information pertaining
to the selling of drugs, if you please.

506
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,431
All right, yeah.

507
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:40,937
Yeah. Well, they got four kilos
of cocaine to sell so...

508
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,355
And they're looking for buyers.

509
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,401
So to protect my family,
I told them I could find one.

510
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,819
Have you?

511
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,114
Are you kidding? I don't know anybody
who would do anything like that.

512
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,158
You do now.

513
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,328
A major drug trafficker
will arrive from Seattle tomorrow.

514
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:01,166
You will set up a meet with these men
at the Dead Dog Farm.

515
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,792
I will?

516
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:07,464
How will I, uh...?
How will I know him?

517
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,800
You're looking at him.

518
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,470
Him? Him...

519
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:18,725
Will you excuse me?
I've got a nervous bladder.

520
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,940
Why?! Why?! Why would you?

521
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,448
You could have...

522
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,546
Is she gonna be okay?

523
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,051
First time he beat her,
I swore revenge.

524
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,054
Something violent and noble.

525
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,598
She begged me not to hurt him,
made me promise,

526
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,142
said it was for both our sakes.

527
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,979
That was four years ago.

528
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,359
One day, I swear, I'll kill him.

529
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,779
No matter what it costs.

530
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,223
Jeez, Mom,
give me a heart attack.

531
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,933
I'm sorry.

532
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,562
What are you doing here
sitting alone in the dark?

533
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:51,150
Nothing. Just sitting here.

534
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:55,196
Well, read a book or something,
will you? It's creepy.

535
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,123
It's Dad, right?

536
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,333
He'll be back, you know he will.

537
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,086
This is just some of that
top-secret jazz.

538
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,339
I'm not so sure this time.

539
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,889
I was at the Double R
a couple of weeks ago.

540
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:26,811
Dad and I, we had this talk

541
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:30,315
about this dream he had.

542
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:36,362
It was a big house in white marble,
lots of lights.

543
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:41,075
Dad was there, and I was there too,

544
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:45,496
living a life of deep harmony and joy.

545
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,917
And there was all this stuff
about my future.

546
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,587
Good stuff.

547
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:58,509
Kind of nice. Mom, it was cool.

548
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:02,472
Your father
is an extraordinary human being.

549
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:07,560
My father
is a deeply weird individual.

550
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,814
But he has a lot more going on
under his hat than most people,

551
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,858
that's for sure.

552
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,444
Sometimes when I'm sleeping

553
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:21,115
he runs his fingers through my hair.

554
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:25,536
He thinks I don't notice, but I do.

555
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,174
How long have I been gone?

556
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:42,637
- Two days.
- Strange.

557
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,598
It seemed much shorter.

558
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,143
Garland!

559
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,735
Bobby, I want you
to put out that cigarette.

560
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,494
Then I'd like you to fix me a cocktail.

561
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,080
A strong one, if you don't mind.

562
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,998
Sure, Dad.

563
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,508
Is everything all right?

564
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,136
No, dear.

565
00:45:23,679 --> 00:46:28,409
Not exactly.
