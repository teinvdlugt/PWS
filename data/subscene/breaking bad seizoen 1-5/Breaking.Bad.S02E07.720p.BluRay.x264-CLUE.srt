1
00:00:16,302 --> 00:00:19,680
<i>The city's called Duke
The state's called New Mexico</i>

2
00:00:26,062 --> 00:00:30,066
<i>Among the gangsters
The gringos' fame is inflated</i>

3
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:35,362
<i>'Cause of the new drug they created</i>

4
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:49,502
<i>They say the colour is blue
And the quality pure</i>

5
00:00:55,674 --> 00:00:59,678
<i>This potent drug's runnin'
Through the city</i>

6
00:01:00,513 --> 00:01:05,017
<i>And no one could stop it
If they wanted to</i>

7
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:13,692
<i>The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect</i>

8
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,699
<i>Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now</i>

9
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:27,456
<i>No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face</i>

10
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:31,711
<i>The cartel's 'bout respect
And they ain't forgiving</i>

11
00:01:32,878 --> 00:01:39,468
<i>But that homey's dead
He just doesn't know it yet</i>

12
00:01:55,109 --> 00:02:01,699
<i>Heisenberg's fame has got
Down to Michoacan</i>

13
00:02:04,326 --> 00:02:08,414
<i>From way far away
They want to taste that meth</i>

14
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:14,253
<i>That blue stuff has crossed the border</i>

15
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,888
<i>Now New Mexico's livin' up to its name</i>

16
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:37,443
<i>Looks just like Mexico
In all the drugs it's hiding</i>

17
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:43,824
<i>Except there's a gringo boss
And he's known as "Heisenberg"</i>

18
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:51,957
<i>The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect</i>

19
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:58,881
<i>Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now</i>

20
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:06,514
<i>No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face</i>

21
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:10,893
<i>The fury of the cartel
Ain't no one escaped it yet</i>

22
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:15,314
<i>But that homey's dead</i>

23
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:18,818
<i>He just doesn't know it yet</i>

24
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:49,390
Nitrogen bonds to oxygen,
which in turn...

25
00:03:51,142 --> 00:03:53,352
You do know what a bond is?

26
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,775
A strong force of attraction.

27
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:03,154
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.

28
00:04:03,362 --> 00:04:07,742
The coming together of atoms
and molecules to form compounds.

29
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,410
No?

30
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:15,624
Chemical bonds
are what make matter matter.

31
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,920
Bonds are what hold
the physical world together.

32
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:24,383
- What hold us together.
- Yeah. Yeah. No, I got it.

33
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:25,593
Bonds.

34
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,431
Your test score says otherwise.
It tells me you don't get it at all.

35
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:34,852
Yeah, but, I mean, 58. I was close.

36
00:04:40,316 --> 00:04:42,443
What is "close"?

37
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:44,612
There's no "close" in science, Barry.

38
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,740
There are right answers
and wrong answers.

39
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:50,201
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.

40
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:54,455
Yeah, but I'm just saying, Mr. White,
two points?

41
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:58,626
Look, if I don't pass chemistry,
I have to go to summer school.

42
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:04,465
And, I mean, I really studied.
Like, really, really studied.

43
00:05:04,673 --> 00:05:07,468
Like, all night, hard.

44
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:11,972
And, I mean, I'm so into chemistry
for, like, the concepts.

45
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:18,020
I just think I might have, you know,
the attention deficit...

46
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,606
Couldn't you please
just let this slide?

47
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:32,827
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

48
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,458
The answer is no.
Next time, apply yourself.

49
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:26,047
<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>

50
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:30,843
Are you ducking me, or what?
This makes the third time.

51
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:36,390
Look, I will be leaving this phone on
for another 15 minutes, so call me.

52
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,520
Oh, and by the way,
that thing we talked about, the...

53
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:44,398
When I said, "Handle it."

54
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:48,736
Well, don't. Just let it go.

55
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:50,446
All right.

56
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:11,425
Come on.

57
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:14,637
Jesse, open the door.

58
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:19,600
I know you're home. Your car is here.
Come on. Hey.

59
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:26,732
Can I help you?

60
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,402
No. Thank you.

61
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:33,906
Well, I'm the manager, so can we stop
with the pounding, please?

62
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:36,450
You're the manager?

63
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:39,120
Yes. Yes, you can help me.
Absolutely.

64
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:44,208
I very much need to get inside here,
so if you have a master key...

65
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:48,087
- You have a key, right?
- Yeah, I have a key.

66
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:53,592
Look, the person who lives here...

67
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:56,721
...it's just very important
for me to see him.

68
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:59,807
- And you knocked, right?
- Yeah.

69
00:08:00,015 --> 00:08:02,017
He didn't answer?

70
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:04,562
Which means...?

71
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,236
- Look, I'm his father, all right?
- You're Mr. Jackson?

72
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:16,991
Yes. That's me. Walt Jackson.

73
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,200
And you are...?

74
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:21,787
- Jane.
- Jane. Very nice to meet you, Jane.

75
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:23,956
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

76
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:27,001
Mr. Jackson,
I'm happy to let you use my phone.

77
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:30,171
- Wanna call him?
- No.

78
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:33,049
No. I--

79
00:08:33,257 --> 00:08:36,719
As I said, I would like
if you let me inside here...

80
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:40,389
...so that I can check on
my son's well-being.

81
00:08:40,598 --> 00:08:42,183
You understand?

82
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:45,519
Look, whatever's going on
between the two of you is family.

83
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:47,521
I don't get involved in family.

84
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,024
Jesse doesn't want you in,
you're not getting in.

85
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:51,233
Period.

86
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:53,152
Sorry.

87
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:01,410
Come on in, Dad.

88
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:07,833
- Thanks.
- You okay?

89
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:10,836
Yeah.

90
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:19,637
"Jesse Jackson"?

91
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:21,597
Do you even...?

92
00:09:23,516 --> 00:09:26,602
Oh, I see you have a telephone,
at least.

93
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:30,147
You know, that blinking thing
I've been calling you on?

94
00:09:30,356 --> 00:09:32,483
Whatever, man.

95
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:38,114
- Hey, give me my-- Give--
- I will break this. I will break this!

96
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:41,867
Damned druggie idiot.
Is this what you've been doing...

97
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:44,245
...the whole time
I've been trying to reach you?

98
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:48,249
- No. I've been taking care of business.
- What business?

99
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:49,959
What business?

100
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:54,839
The business you put me on, asshole.
What, you already forgot?

101
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,597
This business.

102
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:09,937
Does that jog your memory?
Son of a bitch.

103
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:17,111
- You didn't actually--?
- Hey, you said--

104
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:19,572
You said, "Handle it,"
so, you know, I handled it.

105
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,742
When I said, "Handle it,"
I meant fear and intimidation.

106
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,910
I meant get your money back.
I never meant--

107
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:27,204
- Oh, didn't mean to kill somebody?
- No!

108
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:30,374
Well, too late, yo,
because dude's dead.

109
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,460
- Oh, God.
- All right? Way dead.

110
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:36,797
- Oh, God.
- Oh, and, hey, hey, hey. Here.

111
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:38,924
Here's your money.

112
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:44,930
Yeah, 4660 bucks. Your half.

113
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:50,644
Spend it in good health,
you miserable son of a bitch.

114
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,343
I didn't say I killed him.

115
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:26,180
Tell me what happened.

116
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:32,019
Dude's wife crushed his head
with an ATM machine.

117
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,523
- Crushed his--?
- Crushed his head...

118
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:38,776
...with an ATM machine
right in front of me.

119
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:41,028
I mean, crushed it like...

120
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:45,700
Oh, my God, the sound...

121
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:47,660
...it's still in my ears.

122
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:50,579
You know, and the blood,
like, everywhere.

123
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:56,043
Like, there was so much,
you would not believe.

124
00:11:56,252 --> 00:12:01,215
Man, will you just please give me--?
Just give me my weed, all right?

125
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,884
It helps with my nausea.

126
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,471
So...

127
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:10,725
...you did not kill anyone?

128
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:14,562
Does anybody think
that you killed anybody?

129
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,605
I called the cops.

130
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:19,066
You called the cops?

131
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:22,778
Yeah. You know, I called,
and I split, you know?

132
00:12:22,987 --> 00:12:25,072
And then they came in
and busted her.

133
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:29,744
God, she was--
She was so zapped out of her mind.

134
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:33,330
You know? It's...
She did it for, like, nothing.

135
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:37,043
I mean, he told her she was a skank,
but, yo, I mean, she was a skank.

136
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:42,590
Can this person identify you?
Can she identify you being there?

137
00:12:43,758 --> 00:12:47,511
She couldn't identify
her left ass cheek.

138
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,014
She was so zonked.

139
00:12:51,348 --> 00:12:53,601
And she had this...

140
00:12:54,393 --> 00:12:55,895
God, she had this kid.

141
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:59,523
Listen, I'm a little fuzzy
on the mechanics here...

142
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:04,695
...but could you not stop this woman
from killing this man?

143
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:08,699
Look, she had a gun on me,
all right?

144
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:18,084
Yeah, my gun, okay? Mine.

145
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:20,127
Go ahead, say it. Say it.

146
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:24,340
No, I ain't no Tuco or Krazy-8.
I can't run a crew.

147
00:13:24,548 --> 00:13:28,260
Come on. Come on. Point made, man.
Point made. Yes.

148
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,770
<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>

149
00:13:37,978 --> 00:13:40,981
<i>- Hey, it's Badger, man.
- What are you doing?</i>

150
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,985
<i>- Don't use your real name.
- What? That isn't my real name.</i>

151
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:47,238
<i>Okay.</i>

152
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:52,785
<i>Yo, we got those pants you wanted.
Thirty-two large, right?</i>

153
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:55,496
<i>We got them just for you, jefe.</i>

154
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:58,165
<i>Let's do some business, yo.</i>

155
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:08,676
So are you gonna
get back up on that horse?

156
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:13,013
No.

157
00:14:13,222 --> 00:14:16,142
You get on. All right?

158
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,311
I just want to forget. I just...

159
00:14:28,821 --> 00:14:30,156
Sorry.

160
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:44,253
Hey.

161
00:14:44,462 --> 00:14:46,672
Hey, what's up with that?

162
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:51,385
Jesus Malverde,
patron saint of Mexican drug dealers.

163
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:54,221
Well, yeah, hell,
I know who it is, okay?

164
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,016
Scumbags kneeling down
praying to him:

165
00:14:57,224 --> 00:15:02,396
"Please, Señor Saint.
No DEA, please."

166
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:13,616
I'm just-- I'm just saying,
why's he on your desk?

167
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:17,536
Going after neo-Nazis,
you don't wear swastikas, right?

168
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:23,167
- Sun Tzu.
- Son who?

169
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:26,170
<i>Sixth-century Chinese general.
Wrote The Art of War.</i>

170
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:29,090
"If you know your enemy
as yourself...

171
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:31,842
...you'll fight without danger
in many battles."

172
00:15:35,638 --> 00:15:37,264
Right on.

173
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:45,439
- Agent Schrader.
- Sir.

174
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:49,819
- Glad to have you on board.
- Thanks.

175
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:53,906
- Everybody getting you settled in?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Great group of guys.

176
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:57,451
And gals. And gals.
Guys-- Guys and gals.

177
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,371
Good. You couldn't have
picked a better time to arrive.

178
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:03,249
We're about to put a big dent
in the cartel. Right, Vanco?

179
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:05,084
Yes, sir.

180
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,866
Yo, bro, check it out.
It's a satellite picture of you farting.

181
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,828
"Fat Man and Little Boy."
Sounds like you two.

182
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:44,665
I got your fat man in my pants, bitch.

183
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:52,006
- Hey, watch it.
- It ain't real, dumb-ass.

184
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:53,340
Just watch it, is all.

185
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,342
You watch it.

186
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:07,188
I'm Heisenberg.

187
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:09,857
You're Heisenberg?

188
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:12,109
Yeah, I remember you.
You were the cook.

189
00:17:13,194 --> 00:17:14,612
Let's get this over with.

190
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,447
Where's Jesse?

191
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:19,784
- Busy.
- Hey, that's cool.

192
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:21,410
Real cool.

193
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,162
Totally cool.

194
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:24,830
Hey, hey--

195
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,585
It's all there, man. Every dollar.
Case you wanna, like, count it.

196
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:32,963
- Here?
- I'm just saying...

197
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:35,007
Just saying, like, we cool, yo.

198
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:37,343
Ain't got no confusions
and interpretations...

199
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:38,844
...as to who we work for.

200
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:42,264
And that's church, yo. For real.

201
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:49,021
What have you heard?

202
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,943
Did Jesse really...?

203
00:17:54,902 --> 00:17:57,613
I mean, did he really...

204
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:02,660
...squash that dude's head
with an ATM machine?

205
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:04,203
Word.

206
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,710
Who's saying that?

207
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:14,964
Damn, man, it's all over town.
Everybody's like, "Whoa, snap."

208
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:17,842
Usually I gotta chase dudes down
for their money...

209
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,802
...but today everybody's paying up.

210
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,930
True that. Serious.

211
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:25,015
But, like...

212
00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:27,893
He really did it?

213
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:40,197
You didn't hear that from me.

214
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:11,187
Big lunch.

215
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:22,615
Thank you.

216
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:30,706
- Here you go.
- Very good, Ms. White.

217
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:33,626
We'll consider your application
and let you know.

218
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:35,127
Thank you.

219
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:38,381
I'd just like to mention
that I have worked here before.

220
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:39,715
Really?

221
00:19:39,924 --> 00:19:41,801
When are you due?

222
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:47,014
- Several months.
- Congratulations.

223
00:19:47,348 --> 00:19:51,977
I see. Accounting Department.
You left us four years ago?

224
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:53,604
Family.

225
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,817
We'll definitely let you know.
Thank you for coming by.

226
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:07,493
Actually, may I see Ted Beneke?
I-- I think he'll remember me.

227
00:20:07,702 --> 00:20:10,496
Mr. Beneke's very busy today,
unfortunately.

228
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:12,998
You know, if it's okay, I'll just--

229
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:16,669
Ma'am--

230
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:33,477
Skyler. Oh, my God, look at you.

231
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:35,187
Hey, Ted.

232
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:37,690
- Come in, come in.
- Okay.

233
00:20:37,898 --> 00:20:40,526
No calls, Margaret, thanks.

234
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:42,236
Come on, sit down right here.

235
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:44,697
Okay. Thank you.

236
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:51,537
- You look great.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

237
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:53,998
Boy or girl?
Or are you keeping it a secret?

238
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:56,542
Oh, it's a little girl.
We're very excited.

239
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:59,503
I'll bet. One of each.

240
00:21:00,504 --> 00:21:01,964
How's Walt Jr.?

241
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:05,801
Oh, 10th grade,
and he's just growing like a weed.

242
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,553
He's-- He's taller than I am now.

243
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:13,601
Yeah. I'm betting 6'3 ", 6'4"
by the time he's finished.

244
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:16,353
And, wow, handsome. Oh, my God.

245
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:18,147
Good genes.

246
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:26,030
Speaking of movie stars,
those can't be the twins.

247
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:28,407
Oh, yeah. Yep. That's them.

248
00:21:28,616 --> 00:21:30,743
- They're gorgeous.
- Yes, they are.

249
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:33,579
And they know it.

250
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:35,581
I'm in real trouble there, huh?

251
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,458
Yeah.

252
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:41,796
So the big office, huh?

253
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:43,714
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

254
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:45,883
Weird, isn't it?

255
00:21:46,092 --> 00:21:48,427
I still think of it as my dad's.

256
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:49,970
I miss him.

257
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:51,722
Me too.

258
00:21:52,598 --> 00:21:57,770
I'd like to think he'd be proud.
Last year was our best year yet.

259
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:00,106
Yeah, he'd be proud.

260
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:03,818
Walt? How's he doing?

261
00:22:04,026 --> 00:22:08,989
Oh, he's-- He is doing great.
Yeah. He's plugging away.

262
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:12,618
- Great. He's still teaching?
- Yeah.

263
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:17,623
- You tell him I said hello.
- I will definitely do that.

264
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:26,757
To be honest, Ted,
I didn't just stop by to say hello. I...

265
00:22:28,175 --> 00:22:31,262
I was applying for the data-entry job.

266
00:22:32,763 --> 00:22:34,306
You're kidding.

267
00:22:34,515 --> 00:22:36,809
Skyler, you were, like,
our go-to bookkeeper.

268
00:22:37,017 --> 00:22:39,478
Yeah. Well...

269
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:42,148
...the economy, you know, so...

270
00:22:42,356 --> 00:22:45,901
Well, you, data entry?
That'd be a mistake.

271
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:51,615
How about...

272
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,618
...get your old job back?

273
00:22:56,871 --> 00:23:00,666
We're expanding, and, well,
between you and me...

274
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:03,169
...the whole department's
pretty much of a mess.

275
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:06,088
Your work would be cut out for you...

276
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:09,008
...but we could use your help.

277
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,515
Okay.

278
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:22,521
All right. Now, this is our territory,
right? Currently.

279
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,023
Hey. Hello.

280
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:26,567
- Yeah, man. Current. Whatever.
- Now, look at this.

281
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:28,694
Here, here, here and here.

282
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:31,989
What does that look like to you?

283
00:23:33,366 --> 00:23:36,619
Opportunities. Golden ones.
That's what that looks like.

284
00:23:37,578 --> 00:23:40,414
No, look.
Look, it's an entire city full of buyers.

285
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:42,375
Now, why aren't we exploiting that?

286
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:46,045
- Because it's not our territory?
- Because we lack initiative.

287
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:47,546
- Initiative.
- Yes.

288
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:49,715
You need to employ more dealers.

289
00:23:49,924 --> 00:23:52,259
Double, triple your crew.
Those three I met?

290
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:56,722
They should each have three, six, nine
sub-dealers working for them.

291
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,974
Exponential growth,
that's the key here.

292
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:04,939
It's not our territory, man.
Yo, you follow me here, huh?

293
00:24:05,147 --> 00:24:07,817
We go rolling into
these neighbourhoods...

294
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:10,861
...other crews ain't gonna take kindly,
you understand?

295
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:13,739
Sure, they won't like it...

296
00:24:13,948 --> 00:24:16,826
...but I say they're not gonna
do a thing about it.

297
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:18,994
- No. Listen, Jesse--
- No.

298
00:24:19,203 --> 00:24:20,830
Jesse.

299
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:28,045
The game has changed.
The word is out that you are a killer.

300
00:24:28,796 --> 00:24:32,049
- What are you talking about?
- Apparently, it's all over town.

301
00:24:32,258 --> 00:24:34,760
Somebody crossed you,
you got angry...

302
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:38,055
...you crushed their skull
with an ATM machine.

303
00:24:38,264 --> 00:24:40,266
- That's not how it happened.
- Who cares...

304
00:24:40,474 --> 00:24:43,769
...as long as it's our competitors
who believe it and not the police?

305
00:24:43,978 --> 00:24:47,273
- Oh, my--
- No, don't you see how great this is?

306
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:51,569
Look, you-- You are a...

307
00:24:54,822 --> 00:24:56,574
Jesse, look at me.

308
00:24:57,241 --> 00:25:00,369
You are a blowfish.

309
00:25:00,578 --> 00:25:02,788
- What?
- A blowfish. Think about it.

310
00:25:02,997 --> 00:25:07,126
Small in stature,
not swift, not cunning.

311
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:08,627
Easy prey for predators...

312
00:25:08,836 --> 00:25:11,130
...but the blowfish
has a secret weapon...

313
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:13,674
...doesn't he? Doesn't he?

314
00:25:13,883 --> 00:25:17,803
What does the blowfish do, Jesse?
What does the blowfish do?

315
00:25:20,598 --> 00:25:22,641
- I don't even know--
- The blowfish puffs up.

316
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,687
The blowfish puffs himself up
four, five times larger than normal.

317
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:29,482
And why? Why does he do that?

318
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,360
So that it makes him intimidating,
that's why.

319
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:33,569
Intimidating.

320
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:36,989
So that the other scarier fish
are scared off.

321
00:25:37,198 --> 00:25:39,950
And that's you. You are a blowfish.

322
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,120
You see, it's just all an illusion.

323
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:46,332
You see, it's nothing but air.

324
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,335
Now...

325
00:25:49,668 --> 00:25:52,671
...who messes with the blowfish,
Jesse?

326
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:56,300
- Nobody.
- You're damn right.

327
00:25:57,468 --> 00:26:00,554
- I'm a blowfish.
- You are a blowfish.

328
00:26:00,763 --> 00:26:02,264
- Say it again.
- I'm a blowfish.

329
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,350
- Say it like you mean it.
- I'm a blowfish.

330
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:07,436
- You're a blowfish. That's right.
- Yeah!

331
00:26:07,645 --> 00:26:10,523
Blowfishing this up.

332
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:49,562
Hello?

333
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,690
<i>The SkyMall.
Give me the SkyMall, would you?</i>

334
00:26:58,446 --> 00:26:59,864
Vanco...

335
00:27:00,072 --> 00:27:03,617
...new guy don't speak Spanish.
What's up?

336
00:27:04,702 --> 00:27:08,497
Hey, white boy,
better learn Español, huh?

337
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:12,001
This ain't Branson, Missouri,
know what I'm talking about?

338
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:15,713
You know what? I'll teach you.

339
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:22,762
It means, "Let's make a deal."

340
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,264
So go ahead. We're waiting.

341
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:28,559
Okay.

342
00:27:30,728 --> 00:27:32,104
Right here.

343
00:27:32,313 --> 00:27:35,024
"Item SS4G:

344
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:39,779
Yankee Stadium final season
commemorative baseball...

345
00:27:39,987 --> 00:27:41,781
...hand-signed by Derek Jeter."

346
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:44,575
Vanco, write this down.

347
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:47,161
Oh, man, watch out.

348
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:52,625
"66100ZBG: large-size floor runner."

349
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:56,045
Look at that, huh?
It's a rug you put on the floor...

350
00:27:56,253 --> 00:27:59,131
...except for it looks like
a hundred-dollar bill.

351
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,594
<i>I love them. Get me 20 of them.
I'm gonna put them all over my casa.</i>

352
00:28:03,803 --> 00:28:04,970
We'll get you three.

353
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:07,223
- No, you give me 10.
- Five.

354
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:12,603
Hey. How about you stop
jerking us off here?

355
00:28:16,857 --> 00:28:19,944
Where's the meet?
When's it going down?

356
00:28:21,654 --> 00:28:23,656
White boy don't like
let's make a deal, huh?

357
00:28:23,864 --> 00:28:26,659
White boy's gonna kick your ass,
you don't stop wasting time.

358
00:28:26,867 --> 00:28:27,910
Schrader...

359
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:34,583
Hey, white boy. My name's Tortuga.
You know what that means?

360
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:39,255
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole."

361
00:28:39,463 --> 00:28:44,051
Tortuga means "turtle." That's me.

362
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:51,183
I take my time, but I always win.

363
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:56,439
Oh, wait. That reminds me.

364
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:59,150
I seen this earlier. Lookit.

365
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:03,279
This is awesome, homes.
Right there, look at that.

366
00:29:03,487 --> 00:29:06,574
"The tranquil tortoise
garden sculpture."

367
00:29:06,782 --> 00:29:08,451
Definitely two of those, huh?

368
00:29:09,076 --> 00:29:12,204
Check it out, huh? Good likeness.

369
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:16,083
Hank's doing great down there.
He's making inroads.

370
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:18,836
I'm sure he is. He's a hero, after all.

371
00:29:19,045 --> 00:29:22,131
So you gonna go down to El Paso?

372
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:24,800
Please. It's Third World enough
around here.

373
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:26,594
They keep him busy every second.

374
00:29:26,802 --> 00:29:28,804
He's already got some
big operation going.

375
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:31,390
Some hush-hush deal
he couldn't tell me about...

376
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,934
...except it's on the other side
of the border.

377
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:35,728
Wow, that sounds exciting.

378
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:38,481
He's being safe, right?

379
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,775
Yeah.
He says he's mostly riding a desk.

380
00:29:40,983 --> 00:29:43,986
Which, between you and me,
is just the way I want it.

381
00:29:44,737 --> 00:29:47,573
Speaking of riding desks...

382
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:49,742
...got myself a job today.

383
00:29:51,577 --> 00:29:52,578
You did not.

384
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:57,875
As big as you are?

385
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,589
- Thank you.
- You know I just mean...

386
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:05,424
Where? With who?

387
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:09,345
Well, someone willing
to work around that, apparently.

388
00:30:09,553 --> 00:30:10,554
Beneke.

389
00:30:10,763 --> 00:30:14,433
You did not.
Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?

390
00:30:14,642 --> 00:30:16,769
Marie, that was one time
at a Christmas party.

391
00:30:16,977 --> 00:30:21,941
And he was so drunk,
he was practically slurring his words.

392
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:25,486
- Just what you want in an executive.
- And he apologised profusely.

393
00:30:25,695 --> 00:30:29,281
Plus he's married with a family.
I'm sure he doesn't wanna get sued.

394
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,201
It will not happen again.

395
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:36,747
Is money that tight?

396
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:41,293
Yeah.

397
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:44,505
You know we can always help out.

398
00:30:45,297 --> 00:30:47,174
No, Marie.

399
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:49,051
You know Walt. He would just...

400
00:30:53,514 --> 00:30:55,891
- Speak of the devil.
- Hey. Hi, Marie.

401
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,810
How are you? What's up?

402
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:00,771
Nothing much.
How's things with you?

403
00:31:01,272 --> 00:31:02,648
- Good. Good.
- Hi, honey.

404
00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:05,484
- Dinner will be about an hour and--
- Oh, thanks, sweetie.

405
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:09,363
- Everything okay?
- Everything's perfect.

406
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,347
This is Raisin Bran,
not Raisin Bran Crunch.

407
00:31:35,556 --> 00:31:37,558
So? Same thing.

408
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,310
Not the same thing.

409
00:31:39,518 --> 00:31:42,313
I'll tell you what, why don't you
do the grocery shopping?

410
00:31:42,772 --> 00:31:46,776
And then you can get
whatever you want. Great.

411
00:31:46,984 --> 00:31:52,073
It's-- It's not that hard, Mom.
It says "crunch" on the box.

412
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:53,491
You're pushing it.

413
00:31:53,699 --> 00:31:56,452
- Morning.
- Morning, honey.

414
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,704
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

415
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:01,999
Dad, notice anything?

416
00:32:04,043 --> 00:32:05,669
Is there a funeral today?

417
00:32:05,878 --> 00:32:06,879
- A funeral?
- Well--

418
00:32:07,088 --> 00:32:09,215
- Oh, Christ, do I look that bad?
- No, no, no.

419
00:32:09,423 --> 00:32:11,509
Mom got a job.

420
00:32:11,717 --> 00:32:13,135
A job? Why?

421
00:32:13,344 --> 00:32:15,888
Well, do I need to get out
the chequebook and show you?

422
00:32:16,097 --> 00:32:19,225
No, I... Do you think it's a good idea
in your condition?

423
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:22,144
No, no. The doctor said I can work
up until I go into labour.

424
00:32:22,353 --> 00:32:25,731
And it's just an office job.
I'm just sitting on my butt.

425
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,609
Where?

426
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,028
Beneke.

427
00:32:31,237 --> 00:32:33,823
I'm back working
in the Accounting Department.

428
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:37,702
Skyler, what about the welding fumes?
Isn't that why you had to quit...

429
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,913
- ...in the first place?
- They've gone green since then.

430
00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:44,792
They have some kind of
green welding or something.

431
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,753
I didn't smell anything
when I was in there.

432
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,841
Didn't Mr. Beneke pass away?

433
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:53,175
Yeah.

434
00:32:53,384 --> 00:32:54,427
Who's running things?

435
00:32:54,635 --> 00:32:56,887
Ted. The son.

436
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:02,435
Anyway, I have got to go.

437
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:06,230
I don't wanna be late
my first day back.

438
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:08,190
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

439
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,192
- Bye.
- Bye.

440
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:11,819
Okay.

441
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:15,406
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

442
00:33:18,784 --> 00:33:19,785
Bye.

443
00:33:31,672 --> 00:33:33,174
Hey.

444
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,761
You left your cave.

445
00:33:37,261 --> 00:33:38,971
Yeah.

446
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,807
I was-- I'm missing my TV.

447
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:43,392
Thinking maybe I'd hit Costco.

448
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:46,145
You know,
snag a big-ass wide-screen.

449
00:33:47,063 --> 00:33:48,606
So...

450
00:33:49,023 --> 00:33:50,524
Yeah.

451
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:52,860
What you drawing?

452
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,781
Damn.

453
00:33:56,989 --> 00:33:58,366
That's good.

454
00:33:58,574 --> 00:34:00,242
Make a hell of a tat.

455
00:34:00,451 --> 00:34:01,577
That's the plan.

456
00:34:01,786 --> 00:34:02,953
Really?

457
00:34:03,162 --> 00:34:05,998
I work part-time, down at ABQ Ink.

458
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:07,291
Right on.

459
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:12,004
Yo, you're a real good drawer.

460
00:34:12,588 --> 00:34:14,799
I used to do a little of that.

461
00:34:16,592 --> 00:34:19,387
You used to be a drawer too, huh?

462
00:34:22,348 --> 00:34:24,016
What stopped you?

463
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:29,355
You know, just...

464
00:34:29,563 --> 00:34:31,482
So tell me something.

465
00:34:31,691 --> 00:34:36,070
What kind of tattoo artist
has no tattoos?

466
00:34:37,863 --> 00:34:40,199
That's way too big a commitment.

467
00:34:50,626 --> 00:34:52,628
Hey, man. You're Pinkman.

468
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,216
You're the man!
Everybody's been talking about you.

469
00:34:57,425 --> 00:34:58,884
Yeah.

470
00:34:59,135 --> 00:35:01,470
Right on, man. Keep it real.

471
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:10,104
"Pinkman," huh?

472
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:11,731
Yeah.

473
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:14,191
I thought your name was "Jackson."

474
00:35:29,915 --> 00:35:32,585
Well, your snitch
is really earning his nickname.

475
00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:34,045
Are we...?

476
00:35:34,253 --> 00:35:35,755
Are we just on mañana time?

477
00:35:35,963 --> 00:35:37,298
They'll show.

478
00:35:37,506 --> 00:35:40,259
Yeah? Why is that?

479
00:35:40,509 --> 00:35:43,387
You got more catalogues
for him to clean out?

480
00:35:44,096 --> 00:35:47,266
Maybe a little Sharper Image
or Pottery Barn?

481
00:35:51,187 --> 00:35:53,189
What the hell are they thinking?

482
00:35:53,397 --> 00:35:55,900
Sending us some loudmouth
who doesn't speak the language?

483
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,319
Politics, man. Politics.

484
00:36:02,114 --> 00:36:05,284
Supposed to be some hotshot hero.
I say it's a bunch of crap.

485
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:10,790
Hero for Albuquerque, maybe.
Maybe it don't take much up there.

486
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,752
Hey, something
I need to know about?

487
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,338
What? Oh, that? No, man.

488
00:36:17,546 --> 00:36:20,508
We were just singing your praises.

489
00:36:20,716 --> 00:36:22,009
Glad to have you.

490
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:23,969
Welcome aboard.

491
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:46,075
Hey, is that your guy?

492
00:36:47,618 --> 00:36:49,912
Hey, I think that's your guy.

493
00:36:51,247 --> 00:36:53,332
What the hell
is he doing down there?

494
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:01,984
Schrader, where you going?

495
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:06,906
We need an evidence bag, right?
A pretty big one.

496
00:38:08,824 --> 00:38:11,077
What's the matter?
You act like you never saw...

497
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:13,579
...a severed human head
on a tortoise before.

498
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:27,593
Hey, welcome to--

499
00:38:53,244 --> 00:38:54,745
My leg.

500
00:39:14,473 --> 00:39:18,519
<i>- -Headed by Werner Heisenberg,
were also undertaken during the war.</i>

501
00:39:18,728 --> 00:39:21,147
The game has changed, yo.

502
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:24,150
This is our city, all right?

503
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:26,902
All of it. The whole damn place.

504
00:39:27,111 --> 00:39:29,155
Our territory.

505
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,157
We're staking our claim...

506
00:39:31,365 --> 00:39:35,119
...that we sell when we want,
where we want.

507
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:38,080
Now, we're gonna be kings,
understand?

508
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:39,832
Well, I'm gonna be king.

509
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:42,501
You guys will be princes
or dukes or something.

510
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:45,337
- I wanna be a knight.
- But first things first.

511
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,631
We gotta get more dealers.

512
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,342
You know, foot soldiers, right?

513
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:52,344
Now, they'll be working for you.

514
00:39:52,553 --> 00:39:55,639
You're working for me,
and they're working for you.

515
00:39:56,265 --> 00:39:57,933
You follow me?

516
00:39:58,142 --> 00:39:59,935
Layered, like nachos.

517
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:01,854
Exponential growth.

518
00:40:02,063 --> 00:40:05,649
Now, that's success
with a capital S.

519
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:07,401
Straight up, straight up.

520
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,611
For shizzle.

521
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:09,862
Frigging awesome.

522
00:40:21,749 --> 00:40:23,417
Well, we're set.

523
00:40:23,626 --> 00:40:27,129
Our boys are ready.
Gonna be some mad cheddar, yo.

524
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:29,423
Cheddar, Mr. White.

525
00:40:29,632 --> 00:40:33,844
Fat stacks, dead presidents,
cash money.

526
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:37,139
Gonna own this city.

527
00:40:37,932 --> 00:40:39,392
We're not charging enough.

528
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:42,019
What?

529
00:40:42,812 --> 00:40:45,356
You corner the market,
then raise the price.

530
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:48,192
Simple economics.

531
00:41:08,713 --> 00:41:11,090
Oh, hey, Ted. Come on in.

532
00:41:11,298 --> 00:41:14,218
- Looks like they got you all set up.
- Yeah. It's perfect.

533
00:41:14,427 --> 00:41:17,430
I am close enough to the bathroom
that I don't have to waddle far.

534
00:41:17,638 --> 00:41:18,639
And that's very nice.

535
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,100
- I figured that might be a deal-breaker.
- Yeah.

536
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,020
Listen, I...

537
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:28,232
I wanted to thank you
for having me back.

538
00:41:28,983 --> 00:41:31,277
You don't have to thank me.
I need you.

539
00:41:34,613 --> 00:41:38,617
Wow, Ted, it's a little early
for wine, isn't it?

540
00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:40,453
Oh, damn. It's grape juice.

541
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:42,955
Been making the girls
breakfast in the morning.

542
00:41:43,164 --> 00:41:44,623
Hey, how is Denise doing?

543
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:47,626
We split up, about a year ago.

544
00:41:49,712 --> 00:41:51,130
I'm sorry.

545
00:41:52,006 --> 00:41:54,675
She's definitely happier now.
I guess I am too, most days.

546
00:41:54,884 --> 00:41:57,470
- Together since high school.
- Yeah.

547
00:41:57,678 --> 00:41:59,638
- I remember that.
- Anyway...

548
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:02,725
I don't know, people change.

549
00:42:03,017 --> 00:42:04,018
Yes.

550
00:42:04,226 --> 00:42:06,812
Anyway, I just wanted
to welcome you.

551
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:09,523
Welcome you back. And...

552
00:42:09,732 --> 00:42:12,234
I'll see you around
the vending machines.

553
00:42:12,485 --> 00:42:13,944
Okay.

554
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:19,033
We should have lunch one day.

555
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:20,493
Like old times.

556
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:22,828
Sure.

557
00:43:55,504 --> 00:43:57,256
Oh, hey.

558
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,800
Hey, yourself.

559
00:44:04,805 --> 00:44:06,766
So listen. My...

560
00:44:07,308 --> 00:44:10,019
My name is not really
Jesse Jackson.

561
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,857
It's Jesse Pinkman.

562
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:17,943
And that guy you met...

563
00:44:18,277 --> 00:44:22,865
...he's not my dad.

564
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:35,586
You're not gonna kick me out,
are you?

565
00:44:35,795 --> 00:44:38,631
Because I actually really like it here.

566
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:42,927
I don't make it my business
what you do.

567
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:46,055
So long as you don't do it here.

568
00:44:52,645 --> 00:44:56,607
So, hey, I got this kick-ass
new flat-screen.

569
00:45:00,361 --> 00:45:02,113
Wanna see?

570
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,851
It's got that thing where the blacks...

571
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:36,188
...are, like, you know,
really, really, really black.

572
00:45:36,897 --> 00:45:41,736
And the Dolby six-point-whatever.

573
00:45:41,944 --> 00:45:46,073
So it'll really rock the house.

574
00:45:47,033 --> 00:45:48,743
But I'll, you know...

575
00:45:48,951 --> 00:45:54,206
I'll keep it way down, of course.

576
00:46:04,258 --> 00:46:07,386
I don't know what the hell
is taking so long.

577
00:46:10,598 --> 00:46:13,559
Come on, come on.
