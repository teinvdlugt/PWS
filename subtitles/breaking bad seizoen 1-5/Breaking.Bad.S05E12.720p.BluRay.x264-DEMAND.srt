1
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,520
Jesse?

2
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,033
Jesse!

3
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,351
Show yourself right now!

4
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,953
I'll be in touch.

5
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,476
Okay. Hey, Huell.

6
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,720
Listen, I want you to swing by the
high school on your way to Saul's.

7
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,920
I can't believe he would
go after my son, but...

8
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,994
You got it.
And Kuby's at the car wash, right?

9
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,318
Parked right across the street.
All's quiet. No Pinkman.

10
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,392
Okay. Just find him.

11
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,639
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

12
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,992
Jesse, listen.

13
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,274
I mean, obviously,
you've changed your mind here,

14
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,274
and so thank you for that.

15
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,909
And I know you're angry.

16
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,390
I wanna fix this, okay?

17
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,156
Whatever it takes, all right?

18
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,074
We'll talk, and we will fix this.

19
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,393
Until then, just...

20
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,235
Just sleep it off, okay?

21
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,909
And then call me.

22
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,639
Be safe.

23
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,710
How's it coming?

24
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,951
I replaced the doorjamb
and the striker plate.

25
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,277
Switch this out, we'll be good to go.
Good.

26
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,830
Do you want separate keys
for the different locks

27
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,795
or do you want one working both?
No, no, no. No re-key.

28
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,231
Same exact keys as before.

29
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,869
Usually with a break-in,
people like to get new keys.

30
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,997
No, same keys, same locks.

31
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,117
The old keys
have to work here, okay?

32
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,999
Okay.
All right.

33
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,914
Good.

34
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,440
Good. Good, good, good.

35
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,830
Oh, no, no.
Hey, guys, guys, guys.

36
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,590
Cut that. Yeah, this...
That area's still pretty bad.

37
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,031
Right. We'll have to
go over this a lot more.

38
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,873
We've made
three passes already.

39
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,514
Like I say, gasoline's tricky.

40
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,519
No, no, no. The smell has got
to be gone completely.

41
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,230
My wife is coming home,
and I can't have any odor, any stain,

42
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,598
any sign that anything
happened here.

43
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,234
Understand?

44
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,797
I-- I know. This is short notice,
and I really appreciate it.

45
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,390
Sir, we'd love to take
more of your money,

46
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,240
but you've got gas soaked
through to your subfloor.

47
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,399
Until you pull this up and
get new carpet, new padding,

48
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,756
this is as good as it gets.

49
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,518
Is that gasoline?

50
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,673
Ask Dad.
Hey. Over here.

51
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,795
What happened?
What happened is that

52
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,270
I should sue someone.
That's what happened.

53
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,911
So I'm on my way to the drugstore,
and I have to stop to get some gas

54
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,073
and there is this
total pump malfunction.

55
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,391
You know what?
She shouldn't be in this room.

56
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,320
I mean, this is supposedly green,
but you know how it is.

57
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,877
You can close the windows
in the nursery

58
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,714
because it's really
only out here.

59
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,035
This is as good as it gets.

60
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,633
So, uh...

61
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,830
pump malfunction?

62
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,437
Yeah. I'm standing there filling up
like I've done a thousand times

63
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,554
and I hear a chunk.
You know, the pump's nozzle.

64
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,871
The metal thing.
The thing you squeeze?

65
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,273
I hear a chunk.
So I suppose, in my naiveté

66
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,996
I took to understand that gas is
no longer coming out of the nozzle

67
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,198
so I pull out the hose
to put it back and whoosh!

68
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,955
Yeah, I am suddenly
soaked in gasoline.

69
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,353
I mean, on my arms
and my legs and my groin.

70
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,837
So now I am in a panic.
I race home, I run inside the house,

71
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,555
and I'm stripping off
my clothes as fast as I can.

72
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,790
I jump in the shower.

73
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,231
It's not until
after I get out of the shower

74
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,757
that I realize
my gas-covered clothes

75
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,517
have been soaking in the living
room rug this entire time.

76
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,231
I mean, it's-- It's--
The whole thing is just so stupid.

77
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,676
I could have rinsed off
at the station.

78
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,672
Halfway home, I started to realize,

79
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,470
wait a minute, there's a water hose
right there next to the air pump.

80
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,790
You know, for tires.

81
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,952
Anyway, so that was my day.

82
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,316
How was yours?

83
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,791
Dad?
Yeah.

84
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,116
Please, can you just tell the truth?

85
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,632
Tell-- What do you mean?

86
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,637
You fainted, didn't you?

87
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,639
Because you're sick again?

88
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,230
You were pumping gas,
and the fumes,

89
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,710
they made you pass out again.

90
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,076
Just-- Just admit it.

91
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,391
No, the-- No.

92
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,114
It was the pump.

93
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,756
All right, I...

94
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,800
Maybe I did get a little
swimmy at one point

95
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,077
but I did not faint. Okay?

96
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,636
I'm fine, and that's the truth.

97
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,556
However, in the best interest
of all of our continued good health,

98
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,672
I don't think we can stay here.

99
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,513
I mean,
not until we get new carpet.

100
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,670
Yeah.

101
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,875
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie,
they got plenty of space.

102
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,315
Hey, what about a hotel?

103
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,035
A hotel. That could be sweet.

104
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,799
A good one.

105
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,311
I like the way you're thinking. Yes.

106
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,318
Could be a little family vacation.

107
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,079
Might be fun.
What do you say?

108
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,072
Why don't you put
some clothes together.

109
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,550
Yeah. All right.

110
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,672
I'm sorry. It's not my finest hour.

111
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,400
I'll go pack a bag.

112
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,034
Okay.
Okay.

113
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,390
Think this'll leave a scar?

114
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,390
I never should have let
my dojo membership run out.

115
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,716
Jesus. Jesse did that?

116
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,556
Yeah, but you gotta understand,
deep down he loves me.

117
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,031
So where is he?

118
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,034
Still looking.
Where have you looked?

119
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,598
His place, his folk's place,
this Brock kid's place.

120
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,471
Crack shacks at Siesta Hills,
the Indigo, the Crystal Palace,

121
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,474
go-kart joint on Copper Ave,

122
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,154
AA meeting off the 40.

123
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,710
His buddies,
Beaver and what's-his-name?

124
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,998
Badger and Skinny Pete.
Yeah, no, he's not with them.

125
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,879
They could be
covering for him.

126
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,351
I posed as a meter reader. I put a bug
on the tall kid's mom's place.

127
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,878
For three hours straight, all he talked
about was something called <i>Babylon 5.</i>

128
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,759
I checked with my gal at A.P.D.

129
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,799
Pinkman's not in their system

130
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,838
so the cops don't have him.
Yet.

131
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,351
Maybe he changed his mind
about leaving,

132
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,755
called your guy back.

133
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,670
Somebody misses their first chance
with my guy, there's no second.

134
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,639
Well, keep looking.

135
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,439
What then?

136
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,635
What do you mean?

137
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,519
I mean, Pinkman's like a bad penny.

138
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,194
Sooner or later, he'll turn up.

139
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,876
I'm wondering what you wanna do
when he does.

140
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,072
Jesse is upset about the boy.

141
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,756
I just need to explain to him
why that had to happen.

142
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,437
Okay, but say, you know,
just for the sake of argument,

143
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,718
the kid's not in the mood
for a nuanced discussion

144
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,837
of the virtues of child poisoning.

145
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,152
His plans are running more towards
stabbing you to death

146
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,996
with a pointed stick.
In that scenario, then what?

147
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,715
You have a suggestion?

148
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,080
We were wondering if maybe this
isn't an Old Yeller type situation.

149
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,756
Old Yeller?

150
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,270
Yeah, Old Yeller was the best,
most loyal dog there ever was.

151
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,397
I mean, everybody loved that mutt

152
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,234
but one day he showed up rabid

153
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,235
and little Timmy,
for Old Yeller's own sake,

154
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,153
had to, uh...

155
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,794
Oh, you-- You saw the movie.

156
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,595
You're full of colorful metaphors,
aren't you, Saul?

157
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,837
Belize, Old Yeller...

158
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,753
Just brimming with advice.

159
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,793
Do not float that idea again.

160
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,199
Find him.

161
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,595
Sorry. Ah. Sorry.

162
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,951
Room key wouldn't
let me into the ice room

163
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,352
so I had to go down
to the front desk.

164
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,358
But here we are.

165
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,313
Checked in on Junior.

166
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,997
Heh. Pay-per-view and room service.
He's in heaven.

167
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,351
Hey, I thought you
were gonna take a bath.

168
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,716
How's Saul doing?

169
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,277
Saul? Goodman?

170
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,159
No idea.
No?

171
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,355
You were just out talking to him
in the parking lot.

172
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,518
I'm sorry. Were you spying on me?

173
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,035
Yes.

174
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,954
And I feel just awful about it too.

175
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,833
You know, I played along

176
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,957
with your pump malfunction
bullshit

177
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,271
because Junior
was standing right there,

178
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,554
but now I would like to know
what's going on.

179
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,760
First of all, it's no big deal.

180
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,072
Coming here is just me
being overly cautious.

181
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,120
Jesse Pinkman, you know?

182
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,475
He came over to our house
that time for dinner, remember?

183
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,476
Well, he... He got upset over this...

184
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,110
Something he thinks I did.

185
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,316
I did do it.

186
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,480
But I did it for very good reasons.
And it's just-- It's complicated.

187
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,711
Wait, are you...?

188
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,520
Are you telling me that he tried to

189
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,635
burn our house down?

190
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,916
That was...

191
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,474
probably, for a brief moment,
his intention,

192
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,394
but, obviously,
he changed his mind.

193
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,951
And how does that work?

194
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,680
Him--? Him changing his mind?

195
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,037
Ah, God.

196
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,993
Look...

197
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,356
You've got to understand
that with Jesse,

198
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:09,192
there are emotional issues,
personal issues, some drug abuse.

199
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,440
But he has always been more of
a danger to himself than anyone else.

200
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,470
He has a tendency
to fly off the handle, that's all.

201
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,680
So he has never hurt anybody?

202
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,395
No.

203
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,071
I can't believe
you got her down so fast.

204
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,153
So...

205
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,196
what's your course of action here?

206
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,472
Saul's guy, Kuby, tracks him down,
which shouldn't take long,

207
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,200
and when he does, I'm gonna...

208
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,719
I'm gonna talk to him.

209
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,439
Make him see reason.

210
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,593
Talk to him?

211
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,637
Make him see reason?

212
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,472
So I'm clear...

213
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,640
these are just euphemisms

214
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,957
you're using here, right?

215
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,795
No.

216
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,200
What?

217
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,959
Wh--? What does that mean?

218
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,478
My God.
I knew this was going to happen.

219
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,314
I knew it. I told you that someday,

220
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,473
someone was going to come
to our door and try to hurt us.

221
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,960
And now here we are.

222
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,236
No.

223
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,716
Jesse didn't go there to hurt anyone.

224
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,157
He poured gasoline
all over our house, Walt.

225
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,676
He tried to set our house on fire.

226
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,991
He changed his mind.
He didn't do it, did he?

227
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,276
What if he changes it back?

228
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,117
Walt, you need

229
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,873
to deal with this.

230
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,596
How much have you had to drink?
Heh, heh.

231
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,360
Not nearly enough.

232
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,352
I don't know how we got off

233
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,877
on whatever it is
we're talking about here...

234
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,033
but, clearly, I haven't explained
the situation well enough

235
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,157
because this is a big overreaction.

236
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,036
We all need to just take
a deep breath and calm down

237
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,113
because Jesse isn't just some...

238
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,438
Some-- Some rabid dog.

239
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,311
This is a person.
A person that is a threat to us.

240
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,953
I mean, my God, where we are now
with Hank and Marie

241
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,271
and that awful tape we made.

242
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,875
After everything we've done,

243
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,475
you can't just talk to this person.

244
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,320
You're saying...

245
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,871
that I just...

246
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,430
What--? What exactly are you saying?

247
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,875
We've come this far.

248
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,359
For us.

249
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,038
What's one more?

250
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,595
Jesse!

251
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,320
Stop what you're doing
and turn and face me!

252
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,830
You wanna--?
You wanna know what he did?

253
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,195
You wanna hear about it?

254
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,034
Jesse, put out the lighter.

255
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,034
He poisoned a little kid.

256
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,035
An 8-year-old boy.

257
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,237
Just because, you know--

258
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,954
Just as a move!

259
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,589
Walt's a bastard. Secret's out.

260
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,870
We'll talk about it.

261
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,953
But I need you to put out
the lighter, okay?

262
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,840
Look, Jesse...

263
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,473
Jesse, I don't wanna kill you.

264
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,111
And you don't wanna be killed.

265
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,158
So put it out.

266
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,949
He can't keep getting away with it!

267
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,193
He can't keep getting away with it!

268
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,476
He won't.

269
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,351
You really wanna burn him down?

270
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,718
Let's do it together.

271
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,836
You were following me?

272
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,034
Yeah. Since Goodman's.

273
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,752
Where we going now?

274
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,914
DEA. Downtown.

275
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,520
What, I'm, like, arrested?

276
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,072
Yeah, you know how this works.

277
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,311
Be a good witness for me,

278
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,278
it'll go better for you.

279
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,951
Yeah, sitting around MDC,

280
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,391
waiting to be a witness
against Mr. White.

281
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,756
It's... Heh.

282
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,111
It's gonna go great for me.

283
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,920
So...

284
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,478
you're angry.

285
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,200
I can't sleep. I'm not eating.

286
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,312
Last night, I was online for six hours
looking up untraceable poisons.

287
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,278
This close family friend

288
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,875
had been keeping a secret
from you and Hank,

289
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,950
and somehow this person's secret
became known,

290
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,830
and now you're sad and hurt
and angry.

291
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,871
I'm--? I'm in the ballpark?

292
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,759
To be this wrong
about someone.

293
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,832
This off.

294
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,118
We all lead double lives
to some extent, don't we?

295
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,273
We all have our secrets.
Yeah. Not like this.

296
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,279
Not like him.

297
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,313
Marie, I think it's time you filled me in
on some more details here.

298
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,472
Who and what are we talking about?

299
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,433
I said I can't do that.

300
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,871
It'd be bad for Hank.

301
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,398
Our friend made that clear
in his little movie.

302
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,833
Those kids...

303
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,756
under his roof. That baby.

304
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,199
I'm sick just thinking about it.

305
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,591
How could I have not seen this?

306
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,475
If I weren't being such a...

307
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,751
idiotic-- Stupid idiot, I could've--

308
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,952
We could have...

309
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,114
Blackjack winnings.

310
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,115
Nothing suspicious about that at all.

311
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,556
Tell me about this movie.

312
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,872
Dave, can we simply

313
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,236
just focus on my feelings here?

314
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,111
The details don't really matter, do they?
There's nothing to be done, okay?

315
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,152
He screwed us and he won.

316
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,759
Can we just...?

317
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,637
Can we talk about
something else, please?

318
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,519
Yes?

319
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,439
How's work?

320
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,511
Last week, you were upset
about the new parking rules.

321
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,354
Marie?

322
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,237
Saxitoxin.

323
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,949
Derived from shellfish.

324
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,512
Produces a flaccid paralysis
that leaves the victim conscious

325
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,479
through a progression of symptoms.

326
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,272
Death occurs from respiratory failure.

327
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,114
That is definitely a contender.

328
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,598
Marie,

329
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,912
you're not ready to fill me in here,

330
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,799
that's fine.

331
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,391
But I want you to listen.

332
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,677
There is no problem,
no matter how difficult

333
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,839
or painful or seemingly unsolvable,

334
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,957
that violence won't make worse.

335
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,993
I know, I...

336
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,758
Don't worry. I wouldn't hurt anybody.

337
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,479
I just...

338
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,431
It just feels good to think about it.

339
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,829
Hey, babe.
What's the story here?

340
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,957
Oh, well, something's come up.

341
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,232
I thought you might wanna get out
of the house for a day or two.

342
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,915
You thought I'd pack up
and move out of my own house.

343
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,400
Why? What's going on?

344
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,673
Look, I don't wanna get into it now.

345
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,031
But you know that thing with Walt,
there's...

346
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,510
There's been a development.

347
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,519
What happened? Are you in danger?
No, no, no, not at all.

348
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,677
Just-- It's a fluid situation.

349
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,560
I think it might go a little smoother
if you're not here.

350
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,791
So I... It's gonna be great, you know?

351
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,395
I booked you a spa package
at La Posada.

352
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,474
You can do that river-stones thing.
Hank, what the hell is going on?

353
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,034
Hank?

354
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,354
We have a guest.

355
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,670
He was a little keyed up.
Gave him a couple sleeping pills.

356
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,712
Okay. Okay, so listen.

357
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,076
I bring that kid in,
put him in the system,

358
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,835
Walt's gonna find out
five minutes later. You know?

359
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,151
My last 10 witnesses
died in jail, remember?

360
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,313
And I can't use a DEA safe house
without writing him up.

361
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,113
I can't risk a motel.

362
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,920
I know it sounds crazy,
but this is the best place.

363
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,390
For now.
Just a day or two, tops--

364
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,756
Okay, just answer me
this one question:

365
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,798
Is this bad for Walt?

366
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,480
Yeah. Very.

367
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,469
Good. I'm staying.
I'll heat up lasagna.

368
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,269
Phone's ringing.

369
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,513
<i>You have one new message.</i>

370
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,959
<i>Jesse, listen. Uh...</i>

371
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,470
<i>I mean, obviously,
you've changed your mind here</i>

372
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,479
<i>and so thank you for that.</i>

373
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,677
<i>And I know you're angry.</i>

374
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,789
<i>I wanna fix this, okay?</i>

375
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,516
<i>Whatever it takes, all right?</i>

376
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,717
<i>We'll talk, and we will fix this.</i>

377
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,638
<i>Until then, just...</i>

378
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,394
<i>Just sleep it off, okay?</i>

379
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,358
<i>And then call me.</i>

380
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,794
<i>Be safe.</i>

381
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,435
Hey.

382
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,515
Hey.

383
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,759
What are you still doing up?

384
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,155
Couldn't sleep.

385
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,950
Ah. You and me both.
Here. Have a seat.

386
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,276
Everything okay?
Oh, yeah.

387
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,560
Just business stuff.

388
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,077
Going over some options.

389
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,517
You guys still think
you might buy another car wash?

390
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,713
Oh, uh-- Yeah. Well, maybe.

391
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,519
See how it goes.

392
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,320
How it goes now that--

393
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,838
Now that you're--
You're sick again, right?

394
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,238
No. That's not what I mean.

395
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,080
Hey. Told you not to worry,
remember?

396
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,630
How--? How can I not worry?

397
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,714
Come on.
You think I came all this way

398
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,318
just to let something as silly
as lung cancer take me down?

399
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,033
Not a chance.

400
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,431
I'm not going anywhere.

401
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,311
Should've brought
our suits, huh?

402
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,918
It's okay.

403
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,273
It's all right.

404
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,479
I'll be up in a minute.

405
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,114
Okay.

406
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,954
See you in the morning.
Okay.

407
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,720
Would you like some coffee?

408
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,400
Morning.

409
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,633
You want some coffee?

410
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,600
No. The lady, um...

411
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,354
I think your wife...

412
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,000
You take cream and sugar?

413
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,039
Uh-- Black's--
Black's good.

414
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,799
Thanks.

415
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,120
Thanks.

416
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,112
Thanks.

417
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,470
This is probably
gonna take a while.

418
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,194
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

419
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,278
I'll run some errands.
Okay.

420
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,995
All right.

421
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,119
Uh... You remember Agent Gomez?

422
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,119
How you feeling? Your head clear?
Yeah.

423
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,751
This-- This can't be what you mean
by burning him to the ground, right?

424
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,711
I got stories that'll make your toes curl,

425
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,960
but, you know, it's just "my word
against his word" kind of stuff.

426
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,352
So, you know, I don't really
have any, like, proof or anything.

427
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,512
Gomey, can you grab
the curtains over there?

428
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,189
There's a glare thing
happening here.

429
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,280
You know he's retired,
right? He's...

430
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,199
He's not even
in the business anymore.

431
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,631
So you're never gonna catch him
with a camcorder.

432
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,271
We're gonna catch him. We gotta
do this first, okay? Come on.

433
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,079
Just tell us everything
you remember.

434
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,359
Any business dealings,
any personal dealings,

435
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,672
any criminal activity
you were a witness or a party to.

436
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,473
Anything and everything.

437
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,394
Just tell us your story, okay?

438
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,870
Start from the beginning.
When did you first meet Walter White?

439
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,912
Right. Okay, uh...

440
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,397
I first met Mr. White--

441
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,592
Walter White.

442
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,277
--in junior year chemistry.

443
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,837
He was my teacher.

444
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,760
You believe him?

445
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,833
Yeah. I do, unfortunately.

446
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,554
And I hate to admit it,
but I think the kid is right.

447
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,830
There is no physical evidence,
not that I heard.

448
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,230
Yeah, well, no weapons,
no bodies, no working lab.

449
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,035
Just the word
of one nut-job meth-head

450
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,159
against
Mr. Rogers-Has-a-Lung-Tumor.

451
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,477
So do we take a run
at Lydia Rodarte-Quayle?

452
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,758
Vamonos Pest? Follow up with
the Drew Sharp killing?

453
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,274
Where do we start?

454
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,520
I say we start with this.

455
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,353
<i>Jesse...</i>

456
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,957
<i>I'm gonna be at Civic Plaza
tomorrow at noon.</i>

457
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,797
<i>I hope you'll give me the chance
to explain myself</i>

458
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,438
<i>and talk through everything
once and for all.</i>

459
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,519
<i>I'll be alone and unarmed.</i>

460
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,714
<i>So if you wanna come and shoot me
in the head, that's up to you.</i>

461
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,318
<i>Either way...</i>

462
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,751
<i>I'm in your hands.</i>

463
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,310
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

464
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,870
Go and talk to that asshole?

465
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,275
You can't be serious.

466
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,353
Go and listen.
He wants to explain himself.

467
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,512
We put a wire on you
and let him explain.

468
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,031
So your plan is to do his plan?

469
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,032
You seriously think that this--?

470
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,159
This whole
"once and for all in the plaza" thing

471
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,913
is so he can talk to me?

472
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,719
Why not?

473
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,631
I-- I-- I can't believe you two.

474
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,312
The dude wanted me out of town
before I came to burn his house down,

475
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,358
and now I'm more of a threat to him.

476
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,319
And he's got a zero-tolerance policy
on threats, you know?

477
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,439
If I go to this plaza,
I'm a dead man, is why not.

478
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,592
Hey, Walt's ruthless.

479
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,878
He'll do just about anything
to protect his interests.

480
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,920
I agree.
Except when it comes to you.

481
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,917
He cares about you.
Heh.

482
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,236
Can't you see?

483
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,680
Oh, yeah. You mean when he's not
ripping me off or calling me an idiot

484
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,674
or poisoning people
that I care about?

485
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,958
Yeah, no, Mr. White's gay for me.
Everyone knows that.

486
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,840
No, I mean it.
Based on everything you told us.

487
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,957
Uh, he paid for your rehab,

488
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,510
ran over those two drug dealers
with his car.

489
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,160
Sounds like he saved your life.

490
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,676
Made you a 50-50 partner.
He didn't need to do that.

491
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,878
Yeah, he sort of did. I'm the
only one near as good as him.

492
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,719
I don't know. The way you tell it,

493
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,031
sounds like he's manipulating you
to stick around.

494
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,272
Like he doesn't wanna lose you.
All those numbers he runs on you

495
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,080
over and over,
helping you find the ricin cigarette.

496
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,913
Look how far he'll go to show you--

497
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,754
To convince you
that he's not such a bad guy.

498
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,594
That's what this is.
What if it's about, um,

499
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,558
killing me, you know?

500
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,912
You know, getting me out in the open,

501
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,312
hire some, uh--
Some clock-tower guy

502
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,036
or have me sit on a poisoned needle
or something, you know?

503
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,600
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

504
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,436
The plaza's one of the most wide-open
public places in all of Albuquerque.

505
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,920
It's the middle of the day.

506
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,675
And Agent Gomez and I will
be right there with you.

507
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:00,040
Look, you two guys
are just guys, okay?

508
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,955
Mr. White, he's the devil.

509
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,112
You know, he is.
He is smarter than you,

510
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,351
he is luckier than you.

511
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,115
Whatever-- Whatever you think
is supposed to happen,

512
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,553
I'm telling you,
the exact reverse opposite of that

513
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,240
is gonna happen, okay?

514
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,110
Jesse, Jesse,
we're not brainstorming here.

515
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,431
This is not asking.

516
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,430
Unless you know another way to get the
man or you wanna take your chances

517
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,593
with the banger boys over in MDC,
then this is it.

518
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,480
This is what's happening.

519
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,597
I gotta piss. Can I piss?
Yeah. Down to the left.

520
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,472
You got another SD card?

521
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,116
What?
What if the kid's right?

522
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,475
What if it's a trap?

523
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,840
The kid?

524
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,071
Oh, you mean the junkie murderer

525
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,675
that's dribbling all over
my guest bathroom floor?

526
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,358
Well, then, he's right.

527
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,517
Pinkman gets killed,

528
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,997
and we get it all on tape.

529
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,917
Remember, you're hurt, angry,
but you're here for answers, okay?

530
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,834
But don't... Don't push the questions.

531
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,799
Okay?
Let's not get him suspicious, all right?

532
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,634
You let him do the talking, right?

533
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,118
Just relax.
That's what matters most.

534
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,272
Don't cross your arms,
if you can help it.

535
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,629
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.

536
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,593
<i>Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.
You getting that?</i>

537
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,998
Loud and clear, <i>idiota.
How's it looking, Gomey?</i>

538
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,674
No change.

539
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,559
<i>He's just sitting there.</i>

540
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,040
<i>Are we doing this, or what?</i>

541
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,632
Ready to kick some ass, partner?

542
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,030
All right. Time to go.

543
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,039
Okay.

544
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,036
Hey, Hank, you got eyes on this?
What's with the kid?

545
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,078
He's just standing there.

546
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,591
<i>What the hell is he doing?</i>

547
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,791
He's on the move now.
He's taking off. I think he's running.

548
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,952
Oh, no, no, no, kid. Come on.

549
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,760
You got him? He's at the pay phone.

550
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,912
Who the hell is he calling?

551
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,437
Oh, no, no, no. Come on, kid.

552
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,239
No. Come on.

553
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,430
Hello?

554
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,476
Nice try, asshole.

555
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,915
Jesse, where are you?

556
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,150
I just wanna talk.

557
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,518
No. I'm not doing what you want
anymore. Okay, asshole?

558
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,832
<i>This is just a heads-up
to let you know I'm coming for you.</i>

559
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,516
See, I decided that burning down
your house is nothing.

560
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,913
Next time, I'm gonna get you
where you really live.

561
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,958
Jesse, listen.

562
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,553
Jesse? Jesse?

563
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,440
Daddy! Daddy!
Hey!

564
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,274
Get in.

565
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,000
Son of a bitch!
Stupid, high little--

566
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,674
What the hell
was that all about?

567
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,314
What were you thinking?

568
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,472
Thinking there's another way.
What?

569
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,274
To get him.
There's another way.

570
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,152
A better way.

571
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,353
Hey.

572
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,352
It's Walt.

573
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,600
I'm okay.

574
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,672
I, uh...

575
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,200
Todd...

576
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,990
I think I might have another job
for your uncle.
