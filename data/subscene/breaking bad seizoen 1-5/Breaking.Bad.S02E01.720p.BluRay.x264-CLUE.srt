1
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,987
What is this? It's blue.

2
00:01:50,888 --> 00:01:55,092
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

3
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:58,362
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

4
00:02:05,937 --> 00:02:09,040
Tight, tight, tight. Yeah.

5
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:13,044
Blue, yellow, pink, whatever, man,
just keep bringing me that.

6
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:25,122
You're all right. We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

7
00:02:26,157 --> 00:02:29,060
Just remember
who you're working for.

8
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,598
What did you say?

9
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:36,601
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

10
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:39,370
Like they don't already know that?

11
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:43,241
Are you saying that they're stupid?

12
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,611
No, I'm just saying.

13
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:49,413
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid?

14
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:52,250
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

15
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:53,885
Is that it?

16
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:56,087
Is that what you're doing?

17
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,490
Tuco. Tuco.

18
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:04,962
Hey, why don't we all
just relax, huh?

19
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:14,105
Heisenberg says relax.

20
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,110
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm rela--

21
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:34,992
Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

22
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:39,263
Yeah, that's messed up.

23
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,037
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.

24
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,259
Adjusting for inflation...

25
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:44,161
Good state college,
adjusting for inflation...

26
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:45,897
...say, $45,000 a year.

27
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:52,069
Two kids, four years of college,
$360,000.

28
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,274
Remaining mortgage on the home,
107,000.

29
00:04:56,474 --> 00:05:00,545
Home equity line, 30,000.
That's 137,000.

30
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:04,549
Cost of living, food, clothing,
utilities...

31
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:06,851
...say, 2 grand a month.

32
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:10,555
I mean, that should put a dent in it,
anyway.

33
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:16,627
Twenty-four K a year,
provide for, say, 10 years.

34
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:22,333
That's $240,000.
Plus 360, plus 137.

35
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:25,403
Seven thirty-seven.

36
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,575
Seven hundred and thirty-seven
thousand. That's what I need.

37
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:34,145
That is what I need.

38
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,715
You and I both clear
about 70 grand a week.

39
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:40,751
That's only 10 and half more weeks.
Call it 11.

40
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:45,489
Eleven more drug deals, and always
in a public place from now on.

41
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:50,862
It's doable. Definitely doable.

42
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:17,321
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

43
00:06:33,905 --> 00:06:35,106
Heisenberg!

44
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:43,648
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

45
00:06:44,782 --> 00:06:46,083
What's the matter with you?

46
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:49,620
You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?

47
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,489
- Oh, damn, Tuco.
- Shut up!

48
00:06:52,957 --> 00:06:54,992
There's no pulse.

49
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:57,662
- Do something.
- Do something?

50
00:06:57,895 --> 00:07:00,231
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital.

51
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:02,800
Do something! You're smart, right?

52
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,368
Do that-- Do that thing.

53
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:10,842
No, there's not-- There's nothing.

54
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:12,476
Breathe into his mouth.

55
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:14,979
No, they don't teach that anymore.
It doesn't work.

56
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:18,850
You, come here.
Breathe into his mouth.

57
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,589
No.

58
00:07:57,588 --> 00:07:58,890
Get rid of him.

59
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:01,259
Look, Tuco,
we can't do him like that, man.

60
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,261
Buzzards and rats and all that.

61
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:11,302
I'm just saying, you know?
It's not very Christian.

62
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,438
That sounds like arguing.

63
00:08:48,206 --> 00:08:51,709
Gonzo, hurry up.

64
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:13,497
What's the big hurry?

65
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:22,106
Oh, I... I just think we're done here.

66
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,208
Oh, yeah?

67
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,857
You're done.

68
00:11:00,938 --> 00:11:03,541
Hey, I'm back here.

69
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:09,514
Hello?

70
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:24,962
<i>Are already married--</i>

71
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:26,564
Hello?

72
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,636
<i>Thank you to our viewers--</i>

73
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:33,738
Hey.

74
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:37,808
<i>The crash happened
as rush hour began around 8 a.m.</i>

75
00:11:39,076 --> 00:11:40,678
Walt?

76
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:43,981
Didn't you hear me?

77
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:47,018
Walt.

78
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:54,358
Walt.

79
00:11:55,293 --> 00:11:57,728
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

80
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:00,198
What, you can't answer
when I'm calling you?

81
00:12:04,135 --> 00:12:06,037
Are you okay?

82
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:09,440
Great.

83
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,012
New hat?

84
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:19,016
Yeah.

85
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:23,020
I got some chicken at Albertson's.

86
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:25,056
Do you want me to heat
some up for you?

87
00:12:25,256 --> 00:12:29,126
<i>But they can occasionally adapt
to other local areas...</i>

88
00:12:29,327 --> 00:12:32,864
<i>...like airports, golf courses--</i>

89
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:50,081
Where've you been?

90
00:13:20,344 --> 00:13:21,979
What is...?

91
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:28,119
What are you doing?

92
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:30,354
Okay.

93
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:33,691
You know what?
I've got all this crap on my face.

94
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:35,927
Let me clean up first, okay?

95
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:40,131
You know, Walter Junior's
gonna be home any minute, so...

96
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:43,267
Okay. Yeah, just...

97
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:45,937
Okay. Enough.

98
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:49,207
Hold up. Stop it.

99
00:13:50,474 --> 00:13:51,542
Stop it!

100
00:14:40,158 --> 00:14:45,329
I know you're scared...

101
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:50,801
...and you're angry and frustrated.
And I know none of this is fair.

102
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:56,874
But you cannot take it out on me.

103
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:05,750
Hey, I'm home.

104
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,261
Oh, we are dead.

105
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:25,897
Dead, man.

106
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,699
<i>Ruto or rute
or however the hell you--</i>

107
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,735
- This is conjecture.
- This is conjecture?

108
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:32,870
- Conjecture isn't helping.
- Conjecture--?

109
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,440
- We need to state the facts.
- Okay, fine. Facts, then. Fact A:

110
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:39,744
My phone rang eight times last night.
Dead air, hang ups every time.

111
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:41,712
Second fact:
Like 3 in the morning...

112
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:44,282
...I saw that Caddy of his
cruising my neighbourhood.

113
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:46,918
If he wanted to kill us,
he would've at the junkyard.

114
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:49,687
What is that, conjecture?

115
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:53,524
Are you basing that on that he's got
a normal, healthy brain or something?

116
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:58,162
Did you not see him beat a dude
to death for, like, nothing?

117
00:16:58,362 --> 00:17:01,199
And that way--
That way he just kept staring at us...

118
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,002
...saying, "You're done."

119
00:17:05,203 --> 00:17:06,204
"You're done"?

120
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:09,040
You know what that means?
I will tell you what that means.

121
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,109
That means
exactly how it sounds, yo.

122
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:14,912
All right. We are witnesses.
We are loose ends.

123
00:17:15,112 --> 00:17:17,348
Right now, Tuco's thinking,
"Yeah, hey...

124
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:22,019
...they cook good meth,
but can I trust them?"

125
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,492
What happens
when he decides "no"?

126
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:37,535
No.

127
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:40,505
It is him or us. You understand?
It is him or us!

128
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:53,684
- How would you do it?
- What do you mean, how?

129
00:17:53,885 --> 00:17:57,388
Specifically, how would you do it?
Step by step.

130
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:01,592
All right.

131
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:04,595
Say we set up one last sale.

132
00:18:04,795 --> 00:18:07,999
This is providing he doesn't decide
to waste us before then.

133
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:11,435
Every time we bring in a new batch,
he always tests the product, right?

134
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:15,973
So as his head is down,
you know, giving it a snort, just:

135
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:19,010
So three shots?

136
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,947
- Three shots or, I don't know, two.
- Wait, is it two, or is it three?

137
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:25,550
- Two would probably work, I guess.
- Okay, two shots.

138
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,185
Two in the chest, in the face?

139
00:18:27,418 --> 00:18:30,888
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

140
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:35,726
Okay.
All right, we'll put a pin in that.

141
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:37,962
But by now, the big guy, Gonzo...

142
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:40,198
- ...he's probably coming at you, right?
- Yeah.

143
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:42,600
- You turn toward him.
- Yeah, just wheel on him--

144
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,635
How many shots for him?
He's a big guy.

145
00:18:44,836 --> 00:18:46,204
How many shots does that take?

146
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:48,206
- I don't know. Three shots.
- Three shots.

147
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:51,209
Okay, Tuco and Gonzo.
Two men down.

148
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:53,010
Now, is there anyone else there?

149
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:57,381
I mean, Tuco is usually
with someone else, right?

150
00:18:57,615 --> 00:19:02,220
Maybe even a couple of guys.
His dealers, his posse.

151
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:06,858
All right.

152
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,361
So we'll put a pin in that one too.

153
00:19:10,595 --> 00:19:12,530
At this point, how many shots fired?

154
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:15,766
You've gotta be running low.
How many bullets does that gun take?

155
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:22,707
It's not--

156
00:19:32,316 --> 00:19:35,253
How can you suggest
that we kill a man...

157
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:38,089
...and you can't even open the gun?

158
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:45,630
- It's not that easy, is it?
- Hey, man, Walt, you did it.

159
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:52,570
Yeah.

160
00:20:05,383 --> 00:20:07,451
Call Skyler.

161
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:18,262
<i>Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>

162
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:21,999
<i>We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.</i>

163
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,569
Well, aren't you early bird,
up and out already?

164
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:27,371
The big lug and I are gonna go try
that new restaurant...

165
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:29,040
...over by UNM tonight...

166
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,742
...so let me know
if you guys wanna hang.

167
00:20:31,943 --> 00:20:34,045
Listen to me. "Hang."

168
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:37,548
Walt Jr. will be proud.
I know the lingo.

169
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:39,317
I'm still hip.

170
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:42,620
It's Chinese. The restaurant.

171
00:20:42,854 --> 00:20:45,723
I don't know,
I just feel like Chinese.

172
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:51,095
Do you think that people in China
ever just feel like American?

173
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:56,300
You know, and they go out
and get little takeout boxes...

174
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:59,203
...with mashed potatoes
and meat loaf...

175
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:04,108
...and try and figure out how
to use the little knives and forks?

176
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:06,811
I wonder if that ever happens.

177
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:10,581
All right, I'll let you go. So call me.

178
00:21:11,883 --> 00:21:14,085
Skyler didn't pick up?

179
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:17,488
Obviously she's not home.

180
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:27,598
Baby. Baby, wait up.

181
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:30,101
Hey, what was that about Chinese?

182
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:32,270
Dinner tonight. That new place.

183
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,274
- How late they serve?
- I don't know.

184
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:38,342
You got Dave at 8.

185
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:43,614
- Not tonight.
- Yeah, you do. Remember?

186
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:45,383
No, that's Thursday.

187
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:50,087
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's Thursday.

188
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:52,557
Remember how at the last minute
they changed it?

189
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,393
They were gonna charge us
a penalty.

190
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:57,695
Look, baby,
you only got six more sessions.

191
00:21:57,929 --> 00:21:59,030
And I'm doing them, Hank.

192
00:21:59,263 --> 00:22:02,166
I said I would do them,
and I'm doing them.

193
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:05,570
I can't help it if you got
your days of the week wrong.

194
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:07,972
Look out. Sorry, Mr. Schrader.

195
00:22:17,415 --> 00:22:20,585
Look, it's... You know, it's just...

196
00:22:20,818 --> 00:22:22,487
Oh, boy. I...

197
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:27,959
I think Dave is really helping you.

198
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:31,529
Yeah.

199
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:34,499
Yeah.

200
00:22:48,746 --> 00:22:49,780
Sorry about that.

201
00:22:57,555 --> 00:22:59,624
She's...

202
00:23:05,196 --> 00:23:08,599
Hey! Hey, where's my phone call?

203
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:13,337
Hits two in the sand,
two in the forest...

204
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:16,073
- ...and then he says, "Give me a four."
- Hey, Gomez.

205
00:23:16,274 --> 00:23:18,809
Gomez? What do you got for me?

206
00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:21,045
Come on. Chop-chop.

207
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:23,648
Good morning to you too.

208
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:30,521
A.P.D. sent this over.
This was about eight or 10 days ago.

209
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:33,658
- You know Southwest Aniline, right?
- Yeah, off the 25?

210
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:35,092
The place smells like feet.

211
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:37,562
This is them. Check this out.

212
00:23:39,764 --> 00:23:44,435
- Holy shit. What was that?
- Thermite. So they tell me.

213
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:46,404
Burns about 5000 degrees.

214
00:23:46,604 --> 00:23:48,606
Kind of stuff you see
on a James Bond movie.

215
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:52,476
Nice. Guys who know their trade.

216
00:23:55,847 --> 00:23:57,748
Wait. I take that back.

217
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,752
What, they didn't think
about stealing a hand truck?

218
00:24:01,953 --> 00:24:05,690
Hey, try rolling it, morons.
It's a barrel.

219
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:07,692
It rolls. Jesus.

220
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:12,864
- So, what'd they get?
- Methylamine, 30 gallons.

221
00:24:14,265 --> 00:24:16,267
P2P?

222
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:19,337
They're cooking
old school biker meth.

223
00:24:19,937 --> 00:24:21,239
Who the hell still does that?

224
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:24,242
All the old-timers I know
are either dead or in prison.

225
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:26,978
Pseudo's in short supply...

226
00:24:27,178 --> 00:24:30,715
...so these two make do
by changing up the formula.

227
00:24:30,948 --> 00:24:33,518
That and the thermite...

228
00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:35,887
...I'd say these two
know their chemistry.

229
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,789
- But ranking them as burglars?
- Shit.

230
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,826
I wouldn't trust these two
to break into the Special Olympics.

231
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:45,296
They got book learning
but no street skills.

232
00:24:45,496 --> 00:24:46,864
Maybe they're college kids.

233
00:24:47,064 --> 00:24:48,900
Chem students
trying to make a big score.

234
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,335
Yeah, maybe.

235
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:54,138
I tell you, 30 gallons of precursor...

236
00:24:54,338 --> 00:24:57,441
That big a score, they're gonna
wind up stepping on some toes.

237
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,146
Tell you what, they better pray
it's us who catches up to them...

238
00:25:02,346 --> 00:25:05,082
...and not those boys from Juarez.

239
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:33,471
Your daughter wants out.

240
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:06,204
<i>Hey there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.</i>

241
00:27:06,437 --> 00:27:09,040
<i>We can't come to the phone,
so please leave us a message.</i>

242
00:27:11,476 --> 00:27:12,577
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

243
00:27:12,777 --> 00:27:14,278
<i>Thought I'd try you earlier...</i>

244
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:18,115
<i>...before you go out
and, you know, face the day.</i>

245
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:19,584
<i>I'm realising now...</i>

246
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:22,787
<i>...it probably takes you a little longer
to get to the phone...</i>

247
00:27:22,987 --> 00:27:26,290
<i>...owing to the extra baby weight--</i>

248
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:29,927
Hey, sweetie.

249
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,402
Walt, did you spend
the entire night out here?

250
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,172
No.

251
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:44,609
No, no. Well, not all of it.

252
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:50,515
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of--
My stomach, you know.

253
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:54,719
I knew I was gonna be up and down,
so I just didn't wanna wake you.

254
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,216
- How would he know where I live?
- You sure it was Tuco?

255
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:26,517
Who else could it be?

256
00:28:26,717 --> 00:28:28,753
- Did you ever tell him my name?
- No.

257
00:28:28,986 --> 00:28:30,922
Did you tell him
where I live or anything?

258
00:28:31,122 --> 00:28:33,024
- No.
- What about Gonzo, or the dead one?

259
00:28:33,224 --> 00:28:35,393
- Did you tell them anything?
- I didn't say jack.

260
00:28:35,593 --> 00:28:39,130
Okay, Tuco must've put out,
like, you know, feelers.

261
00:28:39,363 --> 00:28:43,467
He's got his ways and means, yo.
Sources, all right? He's closing in.

262
00:28:46,037 --> 00:28:50,942
And what happens when he finds out
that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?

263
00:28:51,142 --> 00:28:53,110
Oh, God. What happens then?

264
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:02,487
Look, it's got five bullets.

265
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,124
I finally figured out how to...
Look, I just finally-- I figured it out.

266
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:09,927
I say we get a second gun, right?
For you.

267
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:14,065
I mean, don't we, like,
double our chances?

268
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:16,033
I mean, mathematically.

269
00:29:18,202 --> 00:29:19,403
I've got a better idea.

270
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:23,508
Thank God.

271
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:25,109
All right.

272
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:27,645
What is it, Mr. White?
Lay it on me.

273
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:32,984
- Beans.
- Beans?

274
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:36,521
They're castor beans.

275
00:29:36,754 --> 00:29:38,356
So, what are we gonna do
with them?

276
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,093
Are we just gonna grow
a magic beanstalk?

277
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:43,895
Climb it and escape?

278
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:47,532
We are going to process them
into ricin.

279
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:50,368
Rice and beans?

280
00:29:52,603 --> 00:29:55,540
Ricin.
It's an extremely effective poison.

281
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,075
It's toxic in small doses.

282
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:00,711
Also fairly easy to overlook
during an autopsy.

283
00:30:01,612 --> 00:30:03,714
All right.

284
00:30:03,948 --> 00:30:06,717
- All right. So--
- Don't touch them.

285
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:11,088
- You can get poisoned from beans?
- Yes.

286
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:15,793
Back in the late '70s, ricin was used
to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.

287
00:30:17,495 --> 00:30:19,630
The KGB modified
the tip of an umbrella...

288
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,933
...to inject a tiny pellet
into the man's leg.

289
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:25,536
And we're talking about an amount
not bigger than the head of a pin.

290
00:30:26,704 --> 00:30:29,140
But it-- It killed him?

291
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,275
Oh, yes.

292
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:35,947
Now we just need to figure out
a delivery device...

293
00:30:36,147 --> 00:30:41,118
...and then no more Tuco.

294
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,729
- Hey, Sky.
- Hey, Hank.

295
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:26,964
How you doing?

296
00:31:27,198 --> 00:31:30,168
Is this... This a bad time?

297
00:31:32,703 --> 00:31:34,872
No, come on in.

298
00:31:43,247 --> 00:31:45,616
I should've called first. I'm sorry.

299
00:31:47,451 --> 00:31:49,554
What can I do for you?

300
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,660
Maybe we ought--

301
00:31:55,893 --> 00:31:57,829
You wanna sit down first?

302
00:31:58,529 --> 00:31:59,597
I don't know, Hank.

303
00:31:59,797 --> 00:32:02,967
Depends on whether or not
this is gonna be about Marie.

304
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:10,208
- Did she send you?
- Hell, no.

305
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:12,977
She's barely even talking to me.

306
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:15,012
That's why I'm here, okay?

307
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:19,317
Self-preservation. Big time.

308
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,255
Look...

309
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:27,024
...I know you gals have
your ups and downs.

310
00:32:27,258 --> 00:32:28,693
- I get it.
- Gals.

311
00:32:28,926 --> 00:32:32,230
And I need to get involved
like I need a second hole in my ass.

312
00:32:33,764 --> 00:32:37,435
But if you could do me this huge favour
and just return her phone calls.

313
00:32:38,002 --> 00:32:42,406
I don't think
I'm quite ready to do that yet.

314
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:46,477
Communication. Communication,
right? Back and forth. Come on.

315
00:32:46,677 --> 00:32:50,114
Sky, do this for me, please.
You can yell at her.

316
00:32:50,314 --> 00:32:52,617
Just call her back.

317
00:32:58,523 --> 00:33:00,591
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.

318
00:33:02,493 --> 00:33:03,861
That's right.

319
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:07,999
That baby tiara
she gave me at the shower?

320
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:11,469
She stole it
from Gertrude Zachary's. Yeah.

321
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:15,006
I almost got arrested
when I went back to return it.

322
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:19,677
And Marie won't admit it.
She won't apologise.

323
00:33:20,711 --> 00:33:21,746
Yeah.

324
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:27,385
If I thought you were gonna return it,
I would have never, you know...

325
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,760
You knew about this.

326
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:39,330
We're working on it.

327
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,633
I mean,
she's got this therapist, Dave.

328
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:45,736
- And I mean, Dave is really good.
- Dave's good, yeah.

329
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:48,573
But it's an ongoing process, Sky...

330
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:52,477
...and we have gotta be
understanding, you know?

331
00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:54,111
I mean, we gotta, you know.

332
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:58,015
We gotta support the shit out of her.

333
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:01,018
Do we?

334
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:02,587
Yeah.

335
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:05,756
I need support.

336
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:08,759
Me.

337
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,962
The almost-40-year-old
pregnant woman...

338
00:34:11,195 --> 00:34:12,964
...with the surprise baby on the way.

339
00:34:13,664 --> 00:34:15,366
And the husband
with the lung cancer...

340
00:34:15,566 --> 00:34:18,302
...who disappears for hours,
and I don't know where he goes.

341
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:20,505
And he barely
even speaks to me anymore.

342
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:23,708
With the moody son
who does the same thing.

343
00:34:23,908 --> 00:34:25,676
And the overdrawn
checking account.

344
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:29,413
And the lukewarm water heater
that leaks rusty-looking crap...

345
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:32,316
...and is rotting out the floor
of the utility closet...

346
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,685
...and we can't even afford to fix it.

347
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:37,855
But, oh, I see.

348
00:34:38,055 --> 00:34:40,691
Now I'm supposed to go,
"Hank, please...

349
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:43,394
...what can I possibly do
to further benefit...

350
00:34:43,594 --> 00:34:46,330
...my spoiled, kleptomaniac,
bitch sister...

351
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:49,467
...who somehow always manages
to be the centre of attention?"

352
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:55,640
Because God knows she's the one
with the really important problems.

353
00:35:11,189 --> 00:35:14,192
Want me to take a look
at that utility closet?

354
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:48,292
That's all it takes?

355
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,029
That's all it takes.

356
00:35:52,964 --> 00:35:55,766
So now what?

357
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,070
Now we arrange our next meet.

358
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:01,639
In a public place this time.
Nice and safe.

359
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,875
Business as usual.

360
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:07,778
And after we sell him our usual
four pounds, then we'll pull this out.

361
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:14,252
"By the way, Tuco, this is a new
formula we've been working on.

362
00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:15,620
Care to try it?"

363
00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:18,623
Okay, well, what's new about it?

364
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:21,993
I mean, just in case he asks.
What do we say?

365
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:23,728
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

366
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:27,431
It gets the user insanely high.

367
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:30,067
I mean, how much salesmanship
do we really need?

368
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:33,738
That degenerate snorts anything
he gets his hands on.

369
00:36:33,971 --> 00:36:37,108
Okay, well, we'll just put
a pin in that, then.

370
00:36:38,075 --> 00:36:43,514
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,
maybe 72...

371
00:36:43,714 --> 00:36:46,284
...it'll look like natural causes.

372
00:36:46,517 --> 00:36:50,555
- What, like a heart attack?
- Yeah.

373
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:52,690
Or the flu, maybe.

374
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,726
His associates won't know
any differently...

375
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:58,830
...and we'll be in the clear.

376
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,999
Not if Tuco kills us first.

377
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:21,385
Just keep it down.

378
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,721
Hey, Hank. What's up?

379
00:37:23,921 --> 00:37:25,490
<i>Oh, hey, buddy.</i>

380
00:37:28,426 --> 00:37:29,460
You been home yet?

381
00:37:31,028 --> 00:37:33,331
No. Why?

382
00:37:33,564 --> 00:37:34,899
<i>Well...</i>

383
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:38,469
Because I really screwed up.

384
00:37:38,669 --> 00:37:41,772
<i>I apologise in advance for the earful
you're gonna hear from Skyler.</i>

385
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:44,742
<i>I was trying to get her and Marie
talking again. Big mistake.</i>

386
00:37:44,942 --> 00:37:50,214
<i>- I should have just kept out of it.
- Yeah, well, okay.</i>

387
00:37:50,414 --> 00:37:51,983
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

388
00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:55,887
Yeah, well, that-- You know, it happens.
It's no problem. No worries.

389
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,656
<i>Yeah, well, thanks, man.
I appreciate that.</i>

390
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,793
Jesus, the wives, huh?

391
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:04,362
Hank, unfortunately, I really--

392
00:38:04,595 --> 00:38:08,099
<i>Oh, yeah.
Hey, man, don't let me keep you.</i>

393
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:13,137
Actually, I'm at work, so... Oh, hey.

394
00:38:13,337 --> 00:38:15,072
You wanna see something
really freaky?

395
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:18,543
<i>- Well, I would, but--
- Seriously, Walt, this is...</i>

396
00:38:19,777 --> 00:38:23,915
You gotta check out this crime scene
me and Gomie are at. Just a second.

397
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:29,253
<i>Hank.</i>

398
00:38:29,453 --> 00:38:31,556
Hang on. It should be
coming through right now.

399
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:38,095
Guess it could be worse, huh?
Could be having a day like these two.

400
00:38:40,698 --> 00:38:42,800
<i>Couple of local bulletheads.</i>

401
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,970
Guess they pissed off
the wrong guy.

402
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:50,541
<i>Walt, you there?</i>

403
00:38:52,977 --> 00:38:54,378
<i>Hey, Walt?</i>

404
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,220
- I'm taking this.
- No. It's my gun. I need it!

405
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,022
No, you don't. Not if you leave town.
Get out of here.

406
00:39:05,223 --> 00:39:08,359
Tuco killing Gonzo means
he's coming after us next. I've...

407
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,963
I've gotta get home. My family.

408
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:55,106
Skyler?

409
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:03,181
Walter, Jr.?

410
00:40:09,587 --> 00:40:11,522
Skyler?

411
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:58,402
Hey.

412
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:01,572
Where's Walter, Jr.?

413
00:41:01,772 --> 00:41:05,443
Having dinner at Louis' house.
Supposedly.

414
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:12,049
Yep. All day, I've had
the whole house to myself.

415
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:18,322
So where have you been
this time?

416
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:27,698
Walt?

417
00:41:40,978 --> 00:41:42,847
Walt?

418
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:03,301
Walt, will you come in here
and talk to me please?

419
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,579
Walt!

420
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:18,216
I'll be right there.

421
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:29,527
Yeah, I recognise
these two knobjobs.

422
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:32,130
Known associates
of a psychotic piece of shit...

423
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:33,598
...named Tuco Salamanca.

424
00:42:33,798 --> 00:42:36,367
- Guess he got tired of associating.
- Yeah.

425
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:39,203
- Hey, do you mind if I get in there?
- No, go ahead.

426
00:42:39,403 --> 00:42:41,672
Thanks.

427
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,311
The big one smells fresher.

428
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,548
You guys find a death wound?

429
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:58,389
I see lots of blood,
but no bullet holes.

430
00:43:00,858 --> 00:43:02,326
Yeah. You done taking pictures?

431
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:05,129
All right. Let's lay them out flat.

432
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,533
Let me get out of your way here,
man.

433
00:43:20,912 --> 00:43:22,280
Snap.

434
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,316
Damn, Ricky.
Leave something for the coroner.

435
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:37,361
Oh, this is beautiful.

436
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:40,364
Hey, someone call Jay Leno.

437
00:43:40,598 --> 00:43:42,300
We got the world's
dumbest criminal.

438
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,936
This guy wasn't murdered. Look.

439
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:49,106
Big stuff here
was moving this guy's body...

440
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:52,643
...when the stack must have shifted.

441
00:43:52,844 --> 00:43:57,281
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,
and he bled out.

442
00:43:57,482 --> 00:44:02,053
- Poetic justice. Oh, I love it.
- Don't you just?

443
00:44:02,286 --> 00:44:04,388
Get a photo of me
with this guy, all right?

444
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:07,859
Old stumpy, here.
Make sure you get the stump in there.

445
00:44:13,397 --> 00:44:17,935
Walt, would you talk to me, please?

446
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:28,212
I don't know where to begin.

447
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,469
What the hell are you doing here?

448
00:45:31,642 --> 00:45:32,710
Get in.

449
00:45:44,956 --> 00:45:47,859
Get in.

450
00:46:02,907 --> 00:46:04,775
Let's go.
