1
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,841
KDK-12, come in.

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,177
- KDK-12.
- KDK-12.

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,764
Hey, Bobby, need you to look in
on Mrs. Peyketewa.

4
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,892
- She all right?
- Her daughter called from California.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,229
She hasn't heard from her in a while,
kind of worried.

6
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:23,106
Will do.

7
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,161
Miss Peyketewa, hello.

8
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:33,801
Miss Peyketewa.

9
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,864
KDK-12 here.
Janet, Jesus, we got a homicide.

10
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,991
- Come again?
- Miss Peyketewa, she's dead.

11
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,327
- I need some backup out here.
- Okay. On their way.

12
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,752
Whoever's in there,
show yourself right now!

13
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,556
Hold it right there.

14
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,057
Let me see your hands.

15
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,267
Hands!

16
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,813
All right, down.

17
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,315
On your knees.

18
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,400
You understand me?

19
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,944
Do you speak English?

20
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,033
I said, down. On your knees.

21
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,784
Down!

22
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,372
Damn it, get down.

23
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,790
On your knees.

24
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,250
Do it.

25
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,755
On your knees or I'll fire!

26
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,550
- Yeah?
- I found the papers.

27
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,012
Right where you left them,
in the crib.

28
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,098
Yeah, well...

29
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,643
You know best, right?

30
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,603
Anything else?

31
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,397
Do you have any thought...

32
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:20,194
...about how we're going
to approach this with Walter Jr?

33
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,071
Well, he's still my son.

34
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,281
- I mean, he will remain...
- Of course.

35
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,660
My point being...

36
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,121
...the divorce.

37
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,709
Well, I...

38
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,837
I think he gets it, don't you?

39
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,965
I mean, I...

40
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,551
I think he saw it coming.

41
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,845
He sees your unhappiness and...

42
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,847
My unhappiness?

43
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,142
My completely out-of-the-clear...

44
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,438
...blue-sky unhappiness?

45
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,273
Really?

46
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,568
Look, as you said, for the best.

47
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,111
Yeah.

48
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,946
Okay.

49
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,575
Last thing and then I'll let you go.

50
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:12,788
In the child support worksheet,
you list medical, dental...

51
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:19,170
...child care, transportation, housing,
education, food, clothing.

52
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,838
That's right, all of it.

53
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,425
Walt.

54
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,971
- No.
- Skyler, you wanted me out...

55
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,974
...I'm out,
but I will provide for my family.

56
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,226
Not with that money.

57
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,480
You'd be making us accessories
after the fact.

58
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,358
How do you think we've been paying
our bills these last six months?

59
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,323
I have to go.

60
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,575
Yep, I was right.

61
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,244
Three units available,
exact same floor plan.

62
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,289
I can call over, get you in
to see any of the others.

63
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,124
No, no, this one's fine.

64
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,460
I'll take it.

65
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,966
Now, unfortunately,
this one is the model, so...

66
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,635
Yeah, I like it.

67
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,637
I like everything about it.

68
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,807
I'll take it as-is.

69
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,355
Name one thing in this world
that is not negotiable.

70
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,156
- You have to clean the fryer.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,453
We try to clean them every night...

72
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:38,499
...but make sure it's off
before you open the intake valve.

73
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,837
Good. Now, I suggest that you add this
to your Monday maintenance schedule.

74
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,506
Yes, sir. Now, select freezing mode...

75
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:49,718
...clock button off, press and hold
auto-control until it beeps.

76
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,720
Main valve on, main switch on.

77
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,307
Give the compressor time
for the needle to enter the green.

78
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,487
You're for real?

79
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,073
- This is all you?
- All me.

80
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,409
Heisenberg who? That's what I say.

81
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,578
My man Jesse can cook.

82
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,539
Check it, yo.
It ain't cloudy or dirty or nothing.

83
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,041
- Just the right shade of blue.
- Good shade.

84
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,211
Check out that crystal size.
If that bitch was any bigger...

85
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,381
...it would be a Jolly Rancher.
- Be my guest.

86
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,553
You sure?

87
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,931
I feel kind of dickish
with you being in rehab and all.

88
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,560
No. I can watch, yo.

89
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,022
- I can cook and I can watch.
- Go for it.

90
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,357
I tried it last week.
I'm still coming down.

91
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,735
Go easy.

92
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,404
Okay.

93
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,215
Riverdance.

94
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,426
Hey, hey, stop marking up my floor,
dumb-ass. Come on.

95
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,557
Bow before me.

96
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,436
I am Lord of the Dance.

97
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,939
Shit.

98
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,607
I gotta try that again.

99
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,692
Yeah, no, I think you're good.

100
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,445
That is awesome, Jesse.

101
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:36,825
I feel like somebody took my brain out
and boiled it in, like, boiling hot...

102
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,119
It's the bomb, man, seriously.

103
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,455
Like anthrax.

104
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,958
Good.

105
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,918
So...

106
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,254
...you ready to talk some business?

107
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,425
You mean this is not, like,
just recreational?

108
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,096
I know...

109
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,181
...what you're thinking.

110
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,643
Trust me,
it's not gonna be like it was.

111
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,437
All right, never gonna be like it was.

112
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,982
- How's that?
- We sell it safe.

113
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,359
All right? We sell it smart.

114
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,821
We don't get greedy, like before.

115
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,490
I don't know, man.

116
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,492
Combo and all.

117
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,335
Still...

118
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,005
...man's gotta make his living.

119
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:36,051
If it's like Jesse says
and we're not greedy...

120
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,845
I mean...

121
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,888
...I guess I can see it.

122
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,225
Had a good thing going
before we started pushing our luck.

123
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,812
- If it can go back to being like that...
- Hey, it will be.

124
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,398
Step one, we build inventory.

125
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,025
Badger, go see Clovis.

126
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:55,696
Get the RV in shape, tune-up,
oil change, brake lights, and whatnot.

127
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,575
Cops always pull you over
for brake lights. Not us.

128
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,868
Cautious.

129
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,161
- Right on.
- You got it.

130
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,874
You know that buzzer thing?
Leave the key in the ignition, it buzzes?

131
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:10,044
Just have him put in
one of those too.

132
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,546
Skinny, you're in charge of supplies.

133
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,757
I'll get you a list.

134
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,425
Right on.

135
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,385
Yeah?

136
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,888
- Yeah.
- All right.

137
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,516
So...

138
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,268
...we good?
- Yeah.

139
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,519
Good?

140
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,064
- All right.
- Let's do this thing.

141
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,247
Brandon Mayhew.

142
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,458
I know you.

143
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,587
Small world, Albuquerque.

144
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,609
Wanna talk about it?

145
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:01,029
Why? It's not like I get a vote.

146
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,825
You know, ironically...

147
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:09,204
...I think you're gonna see
much more of me from now on.

148
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,456
Sure.

149
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,167
Well, just as much of me at least.

150
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,211
I'm taking you to the school,
to and from, every day.

151
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,839
What, I don't get a vote in this
either?

152
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:23,010
I gotta stop going with Louis
just because you're feeling guilty?

153
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,639
I do feel guilty.

154
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,439
I am the man that I am, son...

155
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,943
...and there's plenty
that I would change about that, but...

156
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:47,201
Here we are,
and this is just what it is.

157
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,500
You know what? Call me crazy...

158
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:59,379
...but I'm actually feeling very good
about the future.

159
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,415
Morning.

160
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,084
They're back.

161
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,756
I'm wondering if we should
maybe call the police or something.

162
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,383
Why?

163
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,718
They're doing nothing wrong.

164
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,810
Okay, let's put this on Table 33,
okay?

165
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,021
Hello there.

166
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,191
Mr. White, I presume?

167
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,401
Oh, yes. Hi.

168
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,028
I...

169
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,323
Sorry. I'll be right down.

170
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,835
- Hi. Gale Boetticher.
- Hi.

171
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,548
You're my new lab assistant,
I take it.

172
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,716
Yes, I am.

173
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,386
I suppose you'll wanna hear
my qualifications.

174
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,180
I have my résumé here for you.

175
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,227
I received my bachelor's degree
from UNM.

176
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,063
My master's
from the University of Colorado.

177
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,692
Organic chemistry
with a specialty in...

178
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,568
It's all right there.

179
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,030
"X-ray crystallography."

180
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,240
Really?

181
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,078
I could talk about that for hours.

182
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,579
I would love to.

183
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,375
But first, I'm curious about this.

184
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,381
That's a little pet project of mine.

185
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:34,469
See, in my opinion,
it's all about the quinic acid level.

186
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,598
You want just north of 4800 milligrams
per liter...

187
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,310
...but if you over-boil to get there,
you'll leach your tannins.

188
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,730
Bitterness, yuck.

189
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,274
So I pull a mild vacuum.

190
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:52,738
That way, I can keep the temperature
no higher than 92 C and...

191
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,911
Judge for yourself.

192
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,801
Oh, my God.

193
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:26,146
My God, that is the best coffee
I've ever tasted.

194
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,649
Sumatran beans...

195
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,111
...and I also have to give credit
to the grind...

196
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,989
...but thank you, Mr. White.
- Walt.

197
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,241
Please, call me Walt.

198
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,745
Why the hell are we making meth?

199
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,858
Hey.

200
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,568
Tell me...

201
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,279
...with the phenylacetic acid
solution...

202
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:02,075
...you said 150 drops per minute
for the first 10 minutes...

203
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,912
...and then 90 for the remainder.
Why is that?

204
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,959
Well, my thinking is,
by tapering the phenyl...

205
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,754
...you get an oilier aqueous layer,
and hence...

206
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,590
Better benzene extraction.

207
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,426
Exactly.

208
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,970
But actually, I prefer ether.

209
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,930
Oh, I'll have it for tomorrow.

210
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,733
Gale, I'm wondering how you...

211
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,776
Ended up here.

212
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:43,283
Well, actually, I'm still wondering
how I ended up here, but, yes.

213
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:48,455
I mean, I can't imagine
we strike each other as criminals.

214
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:54,628
Well, there's crime
and then there's crime...

215
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,796
...I suppose.

216
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,798
I'm definitely a libertarian.

217
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,843
Consenting adults want
what they want...

218
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,513
...and if I'm not supplying it,
they will get it somewhere else.

219
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,475
With me, they're getting exactly
what they pay for.

220
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:12,437
No added toxins or adulterants.

221
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:17,442
Yeah, I was doing it
the way you are supposed to...

222
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,488
...pursuing my doctorate at Colorado,
NSF research grant.

223
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,366
I was on my way,
jumping through hoops...

224
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,451
...kissing the proper behinds...

225
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,998
...attending to all the non-chemistry
that one finds oneself occupied by.

226
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,667
You know that world.

227
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,712
That is not what I signed on for.

228
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:43,843
I love the lab.

229
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,472
Because it's all still magic.

230
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,682
You know?

231
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,519
Chemistry?

232
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,188
I mean...

233
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,524
...once you lose that...

234
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:58,858
It is.

235
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,528
It is magic.

236
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,863
It still is.

237
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,744
And all the while, I kept thinking
about that great old Whitman poem:

238
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,873
"When I Heard
the Learn'd Astronomer."

239
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,376
I don't know it.

240
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,877
Anyway...

241
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,380
Well, can you recite it?

242
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,927
Pathetically enough, I could.

243
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,221
All right, well...

244
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,849
No, no, come on. Come on.

245
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,100
Yeah?

246
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,983
When I heard the learn'd astronomer

247
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:45,864
When the proofs, the figures
Were ranged in columns before me

248
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,742
When I was shown the charts
And the diagrams

249
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,578
To add, divide, and measure them

250
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,955
When I, sitting,
Heard the astronomer

251
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:59,044
Where he lectured with much
applause In the lecture-room

252
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:04,924
How soon, unaccountable
I became tired and sick

253
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,385
Till rising and gliding out

254
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,596
I wander'd off by myself

255
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:13,600
In the mystical moist night-air

256
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,518
And from time to time

257
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:20,273
Look'd up in perfect silence
At the stars

258
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,782
Yes.

259
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,617
I am a nerd.

260
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,331
- Bravo.
- Thank you.

261
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,794
Come on, Pinkman.

262
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,004
You little rat bastard.

263
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,466
Get off your lazy ass
and go break the law.

264
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,879
- Hey, baby.
- Are you ever coming home?

265
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,381
Marie, I'm working.

266
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,341
Did you find it? The RV?

267
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,218
No. Working on it, so...

268
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:35,515
Why can't you just arrest him,
make him tell you?

269
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,560
It's not simple. There's a thing
called the Constitution.

270
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,896
Constitution, blah, blah, blah.

271
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,403
This kid, I swear to God,
I wish I just could...

272
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,698
This is that Pinkman character?

273
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,032
That's the one.

274
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,410
Positive the little bastard's
got an RV.

275
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,829
I just don't know where he keeps it.

276
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,583
Until he actually leads me to it
or does something...

277
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,587
...I'm stuck here, Marie, so sorry.

278
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,549
Well, not to bring up
ancient history...

279
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:14,637
...but I, for one, can think of someone
who might know something.

280
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,890
Possibly.

281
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,433
It's worth a shot.

282
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,393
Yeah?

283
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,396
Who?

284
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,068
- Hello.
- Oh, hey, buddy.

285
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,445
Hey, how you doing?

286
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,363
Oh, hey, Hank. What's up?

287
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,449
Listen, I hate to bother you.

288
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,577
- I just had a quick question.
- Shoot.

289
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:41,915
I only ask this because I'm at a,
you know, dead end here, potentially.

290
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,417
I'm working a case and...

291
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:50,882
You know that I would never put you
on the spot or make you uncomfortable.

292
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,718
Hank, you could just cut
to the chase.

293
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:58,598
Back when we lost you
and I was trying to track you down...

294
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,808
...through your student,
Jesse Pinkman.

295
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,896
Now, you know that I know
that once upon a time...

296
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,315
...he may have dealt you
a little weed.

297
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,775
- Hank...
- Just a little.

298
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:11,569
And I so do not care about that.

299
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,947
As far as I'm concerned,
you never inhaled.

300
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,782
Like you said, cut to the chase.

301
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:21,329
Do you remember
if this Pinkman kid ever had an RV?

302
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,584
You know, a recreational vehicle...

303
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:31,256
...you know, like a Winnebago-type
deal, brown and beige?

304
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,134
Why?

305
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:39,264
Long story, but I'm personally of the
opinion he's moved on from weed...

306
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:45,311
...and graduated to selling
crystal meth, using it as a rolling lab.

307
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,943
Walt?

308
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,044
Yo.

309
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,676
What, Mr. White?

310
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,028
How's my favorite genius?

311
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,904
Is this a secure line?

312
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,824
Is this a secure...?
Yes, what's with the...?

313
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,326
Hey, hello to you too.

314
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,037
Listen, we've got a problem,
a DEA problem.

315
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,913
- I'm listening.
- My brother-in-law...

316
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,041
...he knows about the RV.

317
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,250
What RV?

318
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,668
Our RV...

319
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:55,089
...the one which contains a meth lab,
which is covered with my fingerprints.

320
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,885
What does "knows about" mean?
Does he have it? Has he searched it?

321
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:01,846
No, he knows it exists
and he's trying to find it.

322
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:06,059
He has linked it to Jesse. It's a matter
of time before he tracks it down.

323
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,895
So get rid of it!
What are you doing sitting there?

324
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:12,607
Better yet, have Pinkman get rid of it.
Right? You don't go near it.

325
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,693
My brother-in-law,
he is surveilling Jesse's house.

326
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:19,197
So he might have tapped the phones
or bugged his house.

327
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:22,700
Jesus. Plan A, then.
Go. Get to it before the feds do.

328
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:26,037
And do what exactly?

329
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,747
I mean, what...?

330
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:32,126
The thing is the size of a...

331
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,628
It's RV-size.

332
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,422
I mean, where do I go
to make an RV disappear?

333
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,049
I'm not David Copperfield.

334
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,927
What do I look like,
the RV disposal people?

335
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,429
- Did you not plan for this contingency?
- No.

336
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,932
Well, next time, plan for it,
would you?

337
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,810
The Starship Enterprise
had a self-destruct button.

338
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,104
Okay. Shut up.

339
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,273
I'm just saying,
you're good with tools and all.

340
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:59,779
Why don't you invent
a water-powered car, you know?

341
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,990
You did that,
you would be rolling in it.

342
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,451
Socket wrench.

343
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,453
The big one.

344
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,583
What? You scared of the Arabs?

345
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,842
You out of your minds?
Why is this in the open?

346
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,177
- Who the hell are you?
- He's Heisenberg.

347
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,680
- Is this drivable?
- Yeah. I was changing the oil.

348
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,142
Finish it. We'll wipe it clean,
take it out to the desert.

349
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,643
Come on, help me.

350
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,979
Hold up. What's this about?

351
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,482
The DEA,
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

352
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,818
You've heard of them, right?
I know you have.

353
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:43,197
They know all about this RV
and they're trying to find it right now.

354
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,825
I want this off my property now.

355
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,369
No, no, we have got
to destroy the evidence.

356
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,165
- We've gotta rig this thing to burn.
- Not here. Get it out of here.

357
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,625
Now, listen to me.
I need your help, okay?

358
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,045
If I go down, we all go down.
Do you understand?

359
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,048
All right, just...

360
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:05,052
I know a way. I know a guy that'll
wipe this off the planet, no questions.

361
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,512
Call him.

362
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,228
Hey, what about Jesse?

363
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,521
What about him?

364
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,202
Hey, it's me.
Wanna hear something weird?

365
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,371
Now, listen to me.
You get that address.

366
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,876
Now, Badger, I don't care how.
You find out where he's taking it.

367
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,507
Oh, yeah.

368
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,611
Excuse me. Are you leaving?

369
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:21,295
Excuse me, gentlemen, these booths
are for paying customers only.

370
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:25,758
Cynthia, it's okay. I'll handle this.

371
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:32,139
What can I do for you?

372
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,519
You know.

373
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,649
Sunset.

374
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:05,756
Ninety-six, 97, 98, 99, 100.

375
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,967
Beyond recovery, right?

376
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:11,304
- Beyond recovery means...
- I got it. Beyond recovery.

377
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,931
- Obliterated, no evidence.
- Hey, don't worry.

378
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,143
When we're through with it,
it's gonna be about yay big.

379
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:20,980
Then we flatbed it over to Long Beach,
ship it across the Pacific.

380
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,483
Chinese turn it into patio furniture...

381
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,986
...so mind at ease.

382
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:30,656
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I'm obviously gonna need a ride.

383
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,784
- Could you call a cab?
- You got it. Pleasure doing business.

384
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,330
Thank you. I'll be right behind you.
I just need to...

385
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,995
- The hell you think you're doing?
- Me?

386
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:21,332
This is mine just as much as yours.
You don't get to just...

387
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,542
- Oh, God.
- What?

388
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,841
What?

389
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,010
He's here.

390
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,929
Who's here?

391
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,394
Oh, no.

392
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,401
Oh, God.

393
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,070
You led him right to us.

394
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:13,527
Shit.

395
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,197
Mr. Pinkman,
you wanna add resisting arrest?

396
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,366
We'll add it. No skin off my ass.

397
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,120
Last chance to do it the easy way.

398
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,829
Got a warrant?

399
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,416
Who are you, huh? Who are you
and what do you know about this RV?

400
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,710
Well, I'm the owner of this lot...

401
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,256
...which means you're trespassing
on private property.

402
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,259
As far as the RV goes,
seems to me it's locked...

403
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:23,305
...which means you're trying to break
and enter, so again, you got a warrant?

404
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:28,102
Well, I don't need one
if I've got probable cause, counselor.

405
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:32,106
Probable cause usually relates
to vehicles, is my understanding.

406
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,733
You know, traffic stops and whatnot.

407
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,570
See these round rubber things?

408
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,071
Those are wheels.

409
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,739
This is a vehicle.

410
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,577
This is a domicile, a residence...

411
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,707
...protected by the Fourth Amendment
from unlawful search and seizure.

412
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,918
- Why don't you just go out...?
- Did you see this drive?

413
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,420
How do you know it runs?

414
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:57,464
Did you actually witness
any wrongdoing?

415
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:01,594
It seems to me
you're just out here fishing.

416
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,432
Don't see that holding up
in a court of law.

417
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,977
Oh, yeah?

418
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,646
Look at these.

419
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:20,070
What do those look like to you?
They sure look like bullet holes to me.

420
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:24,658
There was a firearm discharged
inside of this domicile.

421
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,746
There's a judge or two out there
who'd see that as probable cause.

422
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,414
Call the Albuquerque police...

423
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:35,836
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

424
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,087
What?

425
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:41,258
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

426
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,344
Say it. Say it.

427
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,972
- DEA operation, there's 20 guys
rushing in here like the wrath of God.

428
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,809
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

429
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,269
That's right.

430
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,147
Probable cause
needs to be readily apparent.

431
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,944
There's somebody in there.

432
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,490
"Private domicile
and I won't be harassed."

433
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:09,328
I'll give you three seconds
to get your ass out here. One, two...

434
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:13,499
This is my own private domicile
and I will not be harassed.

435
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,626
Bitch.

436
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,471
Fine. You want your warrant?

437
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:34,228
I'll have my guys bring it and deliver it
on a little satin pillow. How's that?

438
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:38,857
I waited this long.
I'll wait a little longer.

439
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:00,921
Hey, Vicky.

440
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,674
Yeah, Schrader.
Get me Merkert, will you?

441
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:16,395
You know, I say...

442
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,522
I say we just ram him.

443
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,190
All right?

444
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,027
I mean, we... We...

445
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:27,573
We start her up
and just ram the shit out of his truck.

446
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:30,367
We make our escape. Right?

447
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:43,589
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.

448
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,092
So, what do we do, man, huh?

449
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,887
What do we...? What?

450
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:56,018
Please tell me you got something.

451
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,609
Yeah, I got something.

452
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,164
It's me.

453
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,958
We need your help.

454
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,482
Yeah.

455
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,360
Is this Mr. Henry R. Schrader?

456
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:47,945
Yeah. Who's this?

457
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:51,532
Sir, this is Officer Elaine Tanner
with the Albuquerque police.

458
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,450
Is your wife Marie Schrader?

459
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,494
Yes, why?

460
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,872
I'm sorry to inform you your wife's
been in an automobile accident.

461
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,667
She's being airlifted
to Los Ranchos Medical Center...

462
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:04,211
...and should be arriving there
shortly.

463
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:11,635
- How is she? What's her condition?
- I don't have the current information.

464
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,805
But I think you might wanna get there
as soon as possible.

465
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,809
You're gonna have to
start paying me more.

466
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,035
- Marie?
- I'm just checking in.

467
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,955
I'd love to have some idea of whether
I should cook dinner or not.

468
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:25,417
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

469
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,169
Why?

470
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,673
Hank?

471
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,051
What's up?

472
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,405
I told you before.

473
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:03,742
You will not kill Walter White.

474
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:08,080
Not until my business
with him has concluded.

475
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,749
We've waited long enough.

476
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,460
We won't wait any longer.

477
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,755
You'll have to.

478
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,632
The decision...

479
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,926
...is not yours to make.

480
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:28,934
Explain to me, why this man White?

481
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,440
He betrayed your cousin Tuco, yes.

482
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,486
But he's not the one
who murdered him.

483
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:42,739
Was there not another man...

484
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,283
...who pulled the trigger?

485
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,911
A DEA agent.

486
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:51,123
Bolsa says the DEA is off-limits.

487
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,460
North of the border is my territory.

488
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,379
My say.

489
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,800
As a show of respect...

490
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,136
...I say yes.

491
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:17,190
The agent's name is...

492
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,276
...Hank Schrader.

493
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:26,783
May his death satisfy you.
