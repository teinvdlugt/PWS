Marie, I just-- I just don't have it yet.
The piece I need to prove it all, it's just not here.
Then let them help you.
Tell Steve, tell Ramey.
You've got enough to get them to believe your story at least.
Put the whole DEA on it.
That's how this is supposed to work, right?
No.
No?
What no? What are you, Lone Wolf McQuade?
Look, baby-- You've gotta go in with this, Hank.
Look, the day I go in with this...
that's the last day of my career, all right?
I'm going to have to walk in there, look those people in the eye
and admit that the person I've been chasing the past year
is my own brother-in-law.
It's over for me.
Ten seconds after I tell this story, I'm a civilian.
And then how can we help Skyler if she comes to her senses?
When I go in there...
I'm bringing proof, not suspicions.
I can be the man who caught him, at least.
What if you wait
and they catch Walt without you?
If they find out that you knew and you said nothing?
Hank, wouldn't you go to jail too?
Hey, Hank. Welcome back.
Morning.
Hey. Hey, boss.
How you doing, Hank? Hey.
Hey. Look who's back.
I had to see it with my own eyes.
How you doing? Good. Yeah, yeah. You miss me?
Miss you? Like my balls miss jock itch, maybe.
Yeah? I didn't know you had balls.
All right, don't make me sorry I stopped by here.
Anyway, you got a budget meeting in an hour,
then a meet-and-greet with the new prescription task force guys.
All right. Hey, you know, listen.
Let's see if we can get that budget meeting pushed
and instead see if you could set up a conference call with Ramey.
What for?
Just a "getting back up to speed" thing, you know, for me.
All right. You got it.
Oh, hey. Did you hear about that money thing?
No, what money thing?
Oh, you're gonna love this. It involves your old pal Jesse Pinkman.
Pinkman?
I'll give you this. Jesse, you're never boring.
Not boring at all.
So come on, buddy, share with us.
Why were you tossing millions of dollars all over Albuquerque?
I promise you we can hold out just as long as you can.
That's a fact. I got a bladder the size of a hot water bottle.
Man, all that cash. I wouldn't be able to stop talking about it.
I know. But I don't think I'd be tossing it out my car window.
Heh-heh. Yeah.
My take-home doesn't allow for that whole Robin Hood thing.
But apparently Jesse is raking it in. Yes, indeed.
I'm sure he's got a perfectly reasonable explanation for where he got it.
Sure. He found it.
Or won it in a card game, maybe. That's it. Won it in a card game.
Lucky night at the casino.
Jesse, did you have a lucky night?
Okay. Jesse, we're gonna let you gather your thoughts
so we can continue this stimulating conversation.
Can we get you anything? Coffee? A soda?
Right. Yeah. Thought not.
I have a history with Jesse Pinkman,
and I think he can be helpful to me on another active investigation.
Look, I'm only asking for a couple minutes here.
You said he wasn't talking? Let me tell you, that kid hates my guts.
Despises me, okay?
Maybe I can get him cranked up enough that he starts yapping.
Then you guys go in, get what you need from the little shit-stain, finish him off.
Gives me anything useful while he's with me, I'll share it, 100 percent.
I could use a smoke break. Yeah. How about you?
Yeah. Maybe you could keep an eye on our suspect for us, just for a few minutes.
Absolutely. I can do that.
Okay.
All right, guys.

Hey, Mr. White. It's me. Um,
I know you're probably real busy with retirement
but I got some news I think you should maybe know about.
Me and Declan had some differences of opinion
and it got a little...
messy. Um...
It's all straightened out now
but just a heads-up, there's been a kind of change in management.
Anyway, just thought you should know.
Feel free to give me a call if you want the details
but, you know, it's cool, so whatever.
Okay, then. Thanks. Bye.
<i>Right, so there I am, I'm on top of the train,</i>
pumping the water in, he's watching to make sure we put in
exactly what he'd calculated.
We gotta be real precise because water and methylene weigh different
and he figured it all out
to, like, milliliter. I'm up there with my hose,
we're going as fast as we can. We only got a few minutes.
At the crossing, we got this guy who's smooth-talking the engineer.
And it's all just going great
until this other dude shows up in this monster truck
so we're pretty much screwed, because he can just push
the entire dump truck off the tracks, which, you know, is what he does.
Wait. What's your guy doing?
You can't stop him? Yeah, but what's he gonna say?
"Thanks anyway, sir, but my friends are still stealing cargo back there."
So I'm looking all around, because I know we're not done,
but the gallons are slowly ticking away.
And finally Mr. White tells me to cut it.
So I fling the hose, I'm grabbing the cap, I'm screwing in the bolts.
Just, like, busting ass, you know?
And then I feel the train start moving and I'm--
You're... I'm on top.
Did you piss your pants? Yeah, right?
So the thing starts speeding up, so I jump off the moving train.
Like, total stuntman stuff.
It's like <i>Hooper.</i> You ever see <i>Hooper?</i>
Oh, hey, man, Burt Reynolds. Good movie.
He jumped out of a helicopter, not a train.
Whatever, man. It's a good movie.
This guy Jesse, he's underneath, and the train just drives right over him.
And luckily he's this skinny little guy.
Damn. That's a tight operation.
It was perfect.
No one even knew they got robbed, just like we planned.
Mr. White told me it was, like, the biggest train heist ever,
like, potential money-wise.
So that's how that happened. Ha, ha.
Can I get you anything else?
Nope. Thanks, darling.
I'm ready for the check.
You feeling good about cooking?
Yeah.
You'll be able to run your own lab?
Do it up right? Yeah. For sure. I got this.
All right.
Let's make some money, then. I gotta hit the head.
Ever been on a plane and find yourself
looking down at the armrest next to you,
looking at the little plug where the ashtray used to go?
I look at that and I say, "What the hell happened to this country?"
Nanny state.
I see a kid with a bicycle helmet on,
I wanna smack the shit out of him, like, for his own good.
Mr. Pinkman.
How are you today?
Not so good, huh?
Of course, I might be able to help you out.
I wanna talk to you about your partner, Heisenberg.
See, I know he's my brother-in-law, Walt.
Oh, yeah. That's the look.
Lucky for you, I'm more interested in him.
So I got an offer.
If you help me out here,
tell me all about you and him and your little meth business,
maybe I talk to my friends at the A.P.D.
and make all this go away.
I know he's the mastermind here.
Plus...
I'm thinking, based on your recent activities,
that maybe there's a little trouble in paradise?
Maybe you guys aren't getting along so good?
I'm right, aren't I?
Eat me.
Sure that's how you want to play this?
Why don't you try and beat it out of me?
That's your thing, right?
He really did a number on you, didn't he?
I don't know,
but happy people usually don't go around
throwing millions of dollars away.
I don't think
Walt's gonna be patting you on the back for that.
But maybe that's the point.
But, you see, I get that.
My own brother-in-law,
lying to me for over a year.
Using me.
Maybe you understand that feeling.
Help me out here, Jesse...
and we can put him away.
I know you want that.
I think you wanna talk.
Not to you.
Agent Schrader, beat any good suspects lately?
Tall and taller, ask him about his history with my client.
He knocked the poor kid unconscious last time they were alone.
So, what'll it be, a civil rights lawsuit the size of Montana?
Because I'll oblige you.
Oh. So long, Rocky. Keep your left up.
Detectives, I'm inviting you to leave.
I'm gonna try to remain calm,
but will you do me a favor and tell me what is up with you?
My guys are busting their asses
trying to hide Walt's money from the feds
and you're tossing yours out a window?
And I have to hear about your little act of philanthropy on the news?
Did you hit your head or something?
Why didn't you call me the second you got arrested?
What did you say to Schrader?
Nothing. Jesus. Just chill out.
Chill out? No. No, I don't chill out right now
because things have gone nuclear.
I imagine Schrader shared with you his recent discovery.
Okay, well, then you get my complete lack of chill.
Just use the money that I gave you.
No, Saul. Saul, I--
Stop-- Saul.
Stop talking. I don't care.
Just-- Just make it happen. Work your magic.
And call me when he's out.
Hey, Dad, I'm home.
Oh, okay. I'll be right out.
Hey, you going to work today? You were out late last night.
Huh? I-- Well, I, uh...
Yeah, I guess I just lost track of time.
Dad. Huh?
I'm gonna head out, okay?
Where you going? Uh, Aunt Marie just called.
She wants me to help her with some computer thing
and asked me to stay for dinner.
That cool?
Uh... I guess that--
Cool. All right, see you later.
Wait, uh, son?
Junior. Hang on a second. Yeah?
Oh, good. Come on back inside. What happened?
Oh, this? Nothing. No, I'm fine. It's fine.
Really. I do wanna talk to you, though.
Okay. Are you okay?
Yeah. Here. Sit down a second.
I just don't wanna keep things from you, okay?
I mean, you deserve to know what's happening.
Yesterday, I passed out.
Briefly. Very, very briefly.
And I did this.
Why did you pass out?
Well, my latest scans
show a little shadow on my lung.
But my doctor put me right on a new round of chemo,
which is why I've been so tired lately.
But I was pushing myself too hard.
I know it. I just don't want you to worry.
I learned my lesson.
Well, um, what's the...?
What now?
What now is that we go on, like always. Right?
Hey, don't worry about this, okay?
I know that's hard, but I beat this once.
There's no reason to think I won't again.
And my doctor says I'm doing great.
I'm responding really well to the treatment.
And I'm...
I'm feeling very-- Very good about this, all right?
And what would really help me out
is if we all stayed positive.
Can we do that?
Yeah?
Hm?
Okay.
So why don't you go and help your Aunt Marie
and we'll talk about this later? No. No. No way.
I'm staying. I'm not leaving.
Flynn is not with you, is he? No.
No. Why would he be?
How'd it go?
That bad, huh?
How bad are we talking, Hank?
I didn't tell them.
Why not?
It's just not time yet. No, it's past time.
Way past time. We talked about this.
You've got to tell them now. It's gonna be worse
if they find out that you've kept this from them.
Look, it's just I've got some things I gotta chase down.
What? What things?
Leads, you know.
What leads? What? Something new?
I'm not keeping anything from anybody, Marie, okay? Jesus.
Don't tell me how to do my job.
Walt.
Are you sure about this?
It's the only way.
Okay.
I'm ready.
My name is Walter Hartwell White.
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.
This is my confession.
They're here.
Thank you for coming.
Okay, I'll start.
Skyler and I-- Welcome to GarduÃ±o's.
My name is Trent. I'll be taking care of you.
Can I start anybody off with some beverages? Margarita?
How about some of our tableside guacamole?
I think we're fine. We need some time with the menu.
No worries. Be right back with some water.
So you here to confess?
There's nothing to confess.
We're here to talk about Walter, Jr.
Flynn and Holly should be living with us. End of story.
And while we respect your opinion,
we think that your concern is misplaced.
Skyler and I feel, due to Marie's attempt
to lure him to your house--
I wasn't trying to lure him.
Regardless of what you might call it,
Skyler and I would like to ask you
to please leave our children out of this.
Junior has been through a lot already this year.
You are just...
This investigation, Hank,
do you realize what this will do to him?
Hearing these things?
He's gonna hear it when I kick in your front door and arrest you.
If that day ever comes, so be it.
You have no evidence to support your claims.
Why tear this family apart?
So how about that guacamole?
We make it right here at the table.
I'll just give you guys a few more minutes.
How can you sit there and listen to this?
All we want is for those kids to be safe.
You're putting them in danger, keeping them under the same roof--
They are safe, Marie.
You yourself sent them out of the house. And I brought them back.
Look, whatever you think he did,
this is not an ongoing situation.
Skyler. No.
They need to understand. It's in the past.
It's over. There is nothing to go after here.
There's nothing to accomplish.
How can we believe anything you say?
There's no telling where the lies begin and end.
That affair of yours, did that even happen?
Please. Look, Junior just found out that my cancer is back.
He's already facing the idea of living without his father.
To put this on top of that?
It's just not right.
I swear to God, you start throwing the word "right" at me--
What I mean-- Was it right to run a drug empire?
There is no drug empire.
Lying to your son, to all of us, is that right?
What do I have to do to make you believe me?
Why don't you kill yourself, Walt?
What?
Just kill yourself.
This whole thing dies with you. That's what you're saying here?
Is that Hank should just let it go and wait for you to die.
Well, maybe you should just go ahead and die, then.
That is not a solution. No, it's not a solution.
He's not getting off that easy. Jesus, Hank.
And the same goes for you if you stick with him.
Both of you think you're just gonna walk away from this thing?
Never gonna happen.
That is not what we're saying. Enough with the bullshit.
You're not gonna negotiate your way out of this thing.
There's only one solution: Step up, be a man and admit what you've done.
That's it. There is no other option.
Let's go.
<i>My name is Walter Hartwell White.</i>
<i>I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,</i>
<i>Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.</i>
<i>This is my confession.</i>
<i>If you're watching this tape,</i>
<i>I'm probably dead,</i>
<i>murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader.</i>
<i>Hank has been building a meth empire</i>
<i>for over a year now and using me as his chemist.</i>
<i>Shortly after my 50th birthday,</i>
<i>he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge</i>
<i>to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell</i>
<i>using connections that he made through his career with the DEA.</i>
<i>I was astounded. I...</i>
<i>I always thought Hank was a very moral man</i>
<i>and I was particularly vulnerable at the time,</i>
<i>something he knew</i>
<i>and took advantage of.</i>
<i>I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis</i>
<i>that was poised to bankrupt my family.</i>
<i>Hank took me on a ride-along and showed me just how much money</i>
<i>even a small meth operation could make.</i>
<i>And I was weak.</i>
<i>I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin,</i>
<i>so I agreed.</i>
<i>Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring.</i>
<i>Hank sold me into servitude to this man,</i>
<i>and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family.</i>
<i>I didn't know where to turn.</i>
<i>Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out</i>
<i>and things escalated.</i>
<i>Fring was able to arrange...</i>
<i>Uh, I guess-- I guess you call it a hit on Hank.</i>
<i>It failed, but Hank was seriously injured</i>
<i>and I wound up paying his medical bills,</i>
<i>which amounted to a little over $177,000.</i>
<i>Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge.</i>
<i>Working with a man named Hector Salamanca,</i>
<i>he plotted to kill Fring.</i>
<i>The bomb that he used was built by me.</i>
<i>He gave me no option in that.</i>
<i>I have often contemplated suicide,</i>
<i>but I'm a coward.</i>
<i>I wanted to go to the police...</i>
<i>but I was frightened.</i>
<i>Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA.</i>
<i>To keep me in line, he took my children.</i>
<i>For three months he kept them.</i>
<i>My wife had no idea of my criminal activities,</i>
<i>was horrified to learn what I had done.</i>
<i>I was in hell.</i>
<i>I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family.</i>
<i>Recently, I tried once again to quit,</i>
<i>and in response, he gave me this.</i>
<i>I can't take this anymore.</i>
<i>I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me</i>
<i>or worse, hurt my family.</i>
<i>All I could think to do was to make this video</i>
<i>and hope that the world will finally see this man</i>
<i>for what he really is.</i>
Who do you think he's shown this to?
No one. It's a threat.
It's what he will do if I don't back off.
I think you should show this to Ramey.
Just get ahead of it.
That video is a bunch of lies, Hank. Anybody who knows you will know.
A hundred and seventy-seven thousand dollars?
Hell is he talking about?
Marie?
They told me it was gambling money.
What was gambling money?
Oh, Jesus Christ, Marie.
Oh, God, no. How was I supposed to know?
How was I to know where it came from?
Why were they paying for my bills? What about my insurance?
Insurance wouldn't have covered the treatment you needed, and I...
I wanted the best for you. Why didn't you tell me?
Because I knew that you would refuse it
and without it, you may never have been able to walk again.
Oh, Christ, Marie.
You killed me here.
I mean, it's the-- It's the last nail.
That's the last nail in the coffin.
What do we do?
If I were you, I'd be more nervous.
Ugh. Jesus.
It's always the desert.
Uh, I already checked it.
It's clean. I wouldn't have driven it here if it wasn't.
Get one of these, by the way.
Reads radio signals. Much easier.
What does he know?
I mean, he knows you're Heisenberg.
But I figure not much else,
otherwise, you know, you'd be locked up.
What did he say exactly?
He wants me to inform on you for him.
Tell him everything we did.
Anything else?
I don't think he's told the rest of the DEA.
Why do you say that?
Just him being there all by himself
and, plus, he was acting kind of shady.
Seemed like he didn't want the other cops
hearing what he had to say. Mm.
Are we gonna talk about the rain of caca the kid brought down upon us?
Want to hazard a guess what his little charity drive cost you?
Why don't you go take a walk, Saul?
Jesse, will you let me help you?
I don't like to see you hurting like this.
Maybe it's time for a change.
What kind of change?
I don't know.
I don't know, maybe...
Maybe it's time for you to just
leave all of this behind.
Just get out of town.
Don't look back.
Saul knows a man.
He specializes in giving people new identities.
He would move you someplace far away
and set you up with a whole new life.
Yeah, I know, sounds a little extreme.
But maybe it's exactly what you need.
You know, I really think that would be good for you.
A clean slate.
All right, just think about it.
You get a job, something legitimate, something you like.
Meet a girl, start a family, even.
Hell, you're still so damn young. Heh.
And what's here for you now anyway?
I tell you, if I could, I'd trade places.
A whole lifetime ahead of you
with a chance to hit the reset button.
In a few years,
this might all feel like nothing more than a bad dream.
Would you just, for once,
stop working me?
What are you talking about?
Can you just stop working me for, like, 10 seconds straight?
Huh? Stop jerking me around?
Jesse, I am not working you.
Yes. Yes, you are.
All right, just drop the whole concerned-dad thing
and tell me the truth.
I mean, you're acting like
me leaving town is all about me
and turning over a new leaf, but it's really-- It's really about you.
I mean, you need me gone
because your dickhead brother-in-law is never gonna let up.
Just say so.
Just ask me for a favor.
Just tell me you don't give a shit about me
and it's either this...
It's either this or you'll kill me the same way you killed Mike.
I mean, isn't that what this is all about?
Us meeting way the hell out here.
In case I say no.
Come on.
Just tell me you need this.
Your change.
If you'll hand this to your car wash professional
and have an A-1 day.
Skyler?
Skyler, I've got my chemo in about 45 minutes.
Can you take over the register for me?
Skyler?
It worked
and we're fine.
Okay?
We're fine.
So Palmer and Castanares
are sitting on that jerkoff Saul Goodman's office,
keeping an eye on Jesse Pinkman. Yeah, I put them on it.
You wanna explain that to me?
Yeah. Right.
Why the hell should I know anything? They're just my guys, after all.
You gotta tell me what's going on. Pinkman is A.P.D.'s problem, not ours.
You got a history with this kid.
If he catches wind that you're trailing him
and this explodes, he could sue.
Look, if I can't explain this to Ramey, I gotta pull my guys.
Fine. Take them off.
I said, take them off. What else you want?
I'm going out for a while.
You have that 3:00.
Will you be back?
You know what, it's gonna have to be another day. Reschedule it.
Last chance. You sure there's nobody you wanna say bye to?
Nobody at all?
No.
This is it. Once I make the call, there's no take-backs.
Uh, I need a new dust filter
for my Hoover Max Extract Pressure Pro, model 60.
Can you help me with that?
Yeah, pickup.
He's hot. Um, not "hot" hot, just a little hot.
Currently out on bail. Yeah, he knows the rules.
One hour. Okay, he'll be there.
And done.
Okay,
this guy's fee is 125.
Your benefactor
asked me to send you out with something extra.
Get you started, you know?
Keep you sitting pretty
until you get into the groove of your new life.
Provided, of course, you don't toss it out the window on the way.
Seriously, this is the last of it
so you might wanna think about making a budget.
Hey, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You can't fire up a doob in here. Put that out.
I mean it. Put it out.
Look, Mr. Natural, I'm not gonna let you sabotage this thing.
This guy is not gonna take you if you show up high,
so stop screwing around, or it's both our asses.
Right. Well, that's a start. Now, give with the dope.
Christ.
Some people are immune to good advice.
I'm gonna get a bag for this cash.
Don't even think about lighting up again.
Francesca, we got any bags?
For money. Money-sized bags.
Huell will drop you at the pickup spot,
then he's gonna get the hell out of there.
You got that?
Guy won't pick up the kid if he's got company.
You got a phone?
Cops took it.
All right, in case something goes wrong,
guy doesn't show, whatever, you give me a call.
Seriously? Hello Kitty?
Seriously, it's free.
We got a beggars-choosers situation here, so stop busting my balls.
Corner of Juan Tabo and Osuna.
You, you're gonna sit and wait. This guy's punctual with a capital P.
Okay? So don't move. Don't get up and get an ice cream.
Just stay put like a good boy. He'll pick you up, you pay him.
He'll take your ID, he'll give you a new one.
Goodbye, Jesse Pinkman. Hello, Mr. Credit to Society.
So do I get to pick where I go?
Well, it's your life. I imagine you get a say.
Want a suggestion? How about Florida?
You get a tan, meet the Swedish bikini team,
you know, swim with the dolphins.
What about Alaska?
Alaska. Okay, well, that's a different vibe.
I never figured you for a moose lover,
but whatever floats your boat. Alaska.
Alaska's good.
Anywhere you can get a fresh start is gonna be good.
You ready?
Yeah.
Take care, Jesse.
All right.
Excuse me.
Hey, man, you can't go in there!
He a no-show? Why didn't you call?
Why didn't you--?
Stop! Unh!
Code red!
Huell! No! Hey!
Hey! Get in here!
Back off!
You, stay where you are.
What? I don't know what happened here. What did I do?
You stole it off me.
You and him, you took it out of my pocket, didn't you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down. Yes. Okay. I had Huell lift your dope.
I told you I couldn't risk the guy not taking you.
No! Before. The cigarette.
You stole the cigarette.
What? The ricin cigarette!
You had him steal it off of me!
And all for that asshole Mr. White!
He poisoned Brock!
He poisoned Brock, and you-- You helped him!
Okay, Jesse, calm down. Say it again!
Tell me one more time to calm down! Come on!
I'm sorry. Yes. Okay.
I had Huell lift your cigarette, but Walt made me.
He told me he was helping you, he was saving you.
I never would've agreed to it if I'd known what he was gonna do.
Jesse, you gotta believe me. I didn't want any of this!
Back up!
Get off me! What do I pay you for?
Hey, it's me. We got a big problem.
-eighteen, 19 and 20.
Actually, you gave me a 5, not a 1.
Oh, I-- I did. I'm-- I'm so sorry.
Um, here you go.
Thank you for your honesty.
Oh, and please give this to your car wash professional.
Have an A-1 day.
God.
Hey. Hi.
What's going on? Not much.
Yeah? Nothing? Nope. Things are fine.
Good. Why?
Oh, no reason.
You know what I found the other day
is that the-- The-- The latch on the soda machine wasn't...
latching.
It's-- It's catching every time that I stock that darn thing.
So I thought I'd check it out.
Great.
Thank you.
Oh. Exact change. I like that. Thank you very much.
Okay.
And...
please give this to your car-care professional
and have an A-1 day. Thank you. Thank you.
I just remembered they gave me a prescription
to go pick up, so... I forgot. I'm gonna go
head on over to the drugstore, okay?
Yeah, okay. All right.
ï»¿1
Jesse?
Jesse!
Show yourself right now!
I'll be in touch.
Okay. Hey, Huell.
Listen, I want you to swing by the high school on your way to Saul's.
I can't believe he would go after my son, but...
You got it. And Kuby's at the car wash, right?
Parked right across the street. All's quiet. No Pinkman.
Okay. Just find him.
<i>Please leave a message.</i>
Jesse, listen.
I mean, obviously, you've changed your mind here,
and so thank you for that.
And I know you're angry.
I wanna fix this, okay?
Whatever it takes, all right?
We'll talk, and we will fix this.
Until then, just...
Just sleep it off, okay?
And then call me.
Be safe.
How's it coming?
I replaced the doorjamb and the striker plate.
Switch this out, we'll be good to go. Good.
Do you want separate keys for the different locks
or do you want one working both? No, no, no. No re-key.
Same exact keys as before.
Usually with a break-in, people like to get new keys.
No, same keys, same locks.
The old keys have to work here, okay?
Okay. All right.
Good.
Good. Good, good, good.
Oh, no, no. Hey, guys, guys, guys.
Cut that. Yeah, this... That area's still pretty bad.
Right. We'll have to go over this a lot more.
We've made three passes already.
Like I say, gasoline's tricky.
No, no, no. The smell has got to be gone completely.
My wife is coming home, and I can't have any odor, any stain,
any sign that anything happened here.
Understand?
I-- I know. This is short notice, and I really appreciate it.
Sir, we'd love to take more of your money,
but you've got gas soaked through to your subfloor.
Until you pull this up and get new carpet, new padding,
this is as good as it gets.
Is that gasoline?
Ask Dad. Hey. Over here.
What happened? What happened is that
I should sue someone. That's what happened.
So I'm on my way to the drugstore, and I have to stop to get some gas
and there is this total pump malfunction.
You know what? She shouldn't be in this room.
I mean, this is supposedly green, but you know how it is.
You can close the windows in the nursery
because it's really only out here.
This is as good as it gets.
So, uh...
pump malfunction?
Yeah. I'm standing there filling up like I've done a thousand times
and I hear a chunk. You know, the pump's nozzle.
The metal thing. The thing you squeeze?
I hear a chunk. So I suppose, in my naivetÃ©
I took to understand that gas is no longer coming out of the nozzle
so I pull out the hose to put it back and whoosh!
Yeah, I am suddenly soaked in gasoline.
I mean, on my arms and my legs and my groin.
So now I am in a panic. I race home, I run inside the house,
and I'm stripping off my clothes as fast as I can.
I jump in the shower.
It's not until after I get out of the shower
that I realize my gas-covered clothes
have been soaking in the living room rug this entire time.
I mean, it's-- It's-- The whole thing is just so stupid.
I could have rinsed off at the station.
Halfway home, I started to realize,
wait a minute, there's a water hose right there next to the air pump.
You know, for tires.
Anyway, so that was my day.
How was yours?
Dad? Yeah.
Please, can you just tell the truth?
Tell-- What do you mean?
You fainted, didn't you?
Because you're sick again?
You were pumping gas, and the fumes,
they made you pass out again.
Just-- Just admit it.
No, the-- No.
It was the pump.
All right, I...
Maybe I did get a little swimmy at one point
but I did not faint. Okay?
I'm fine, and that's the truth.
However, in the best interest of all of our continued good health,
I don't think we can stay here.
I mean, not until we get new carpet.
Yeah.
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie, they got plenty of space.
Hey, what about a hotel?
A hotel. That could be sweet.
A good one.
I like the way you're thinking. Yes.
Could be a little family vacation.
Might be fun. What do you say?
Why don't you put some clothes together.
Yeah. All right.
I'm sorry. It's not my finest hour.
I'll go pack a bag.
Okay. Okay.
Think this'll leave a scar?
I never should have let my dojo membership run out.
Jesus. Jesse did that?
Yeah, but you gotta understand, deep down he loves me.
So where is he?
Still looking. Where have you looked?
His place, his folk's place, this Brock kid's place.
Crack shacks at Siesta Hills, the Indigo, the Crystal Palace,
go-kart joint on Copper Ave,
AA meeting off the 40.
His buddies, Beaver and what's-his-name?
Badger and Skinny Pete. Yeah, no, he's not with them.
They could be covering for him.
I posed as a meter reader. I put a bug on the tall kid's mom's place.
For three hours straight, all he talked about was something called <i>Babylon 5.</i>
I checked with my gal at A.P.D.
Pinkman's not in their system
so the cops don't have him. Yet.
Maybe he changed his mind about leaving,
called your guy back.
Somebody misses their first chance with my guy, there's no second.
Well, keep looking.
What then?
What do you mean?
I mean, Pinkman's like a bad penny.
Sooner or later, he'll turn up.
I'm wondering what you wanna do when he does.
Jesse is upset about the boy.
I just need to explain to him why that had to happen.
Okay, but say, you know, just for the sake of argument,
the kid's not in the mood for a nuanced discussion
of the virtues of child poisoning.
His plans are running more towards stabbing you to death
with a pointed stick. In that scenario, then what?
You have a suggestion?
We were wondering if maybe this isn't an Old Yeller type situation.
Old Yeller?
Yeah, Old Yeller was the best, most loyal dog there ever was.
I mean, everybody loved that mutt
but one day he showed up rabid
and little Timmy, for Old Yeller's own sake,
had to, uh...
Oh, you-- You saw the movie.
You're full of colorful metaphors, aren't you, Saul?
Belize, Old Yeller...
Just brimming with advice.
Do not float that idea again.
Find him.
Sorry. Ah. Sorry.
Room key wouldn't let me into the ice room
so I had to go down to the front desk.
But here we are.
Checked in on Junior.
Heh. Pay-per-view and room service. He's in heaven.
Hey, I thought you were gonna take a bath.
How's Saul doing?
Saul? Goodman?
No idea. No?
You were just out talking to him in the parking lot.
I'm sorry. Were you spying on me?
Yes.
And I feel just awful about it too.
You know, I played along
with your pump malfunction bullshit
because Junior was standing right there,
but now I would like to know what's going on.
First of all, it's no big deal.
Coming here is just me being overly cautious.
Jesse Pinkman, you know?
He came over to our house that time for dinner, remember?
Well, he... He got upset over this...
Something he thinks I did.
I did do it.
But I did it for very good reasons. And it's just-- It's complicated.
Wait, are you...?
Are you telling me that he tried to
burn our house down?
That was...
probably, for a brief moment, his intention,
but, obviously, he changed his mind.
And how does that work?
Him--? Him changing his mind?
Ah, God.
Look...
You've got to understand that with Jesse,
there are emotional issues, personal issues, some drug abuse.
But he has always been more of a danger to himself than anyone else.
He has a tendency to fly off the handle, that's all.
So he has never hurt anybody?
No.
I can't believe you got her down so fast.
So...
what's your course of action here?
Saul's guy, Kuby, tracks him down, which shouldn't take long,
and when he does, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna talk to him.
Make him see reason.
Talk to him?
Make him see reason?
So I'm clear...
these are just euphemisms
you're using here, right?
No.
What?
Wh--? What does that mean?
My God. I knew this was going to happen.
I knew it. I told you that someday,
someone was going to come to our door and try to hurt us.
And now here we are.
No.
Jesse didn't go there to hurt anyone.
He poured gasoline all over our house, Walt.
He tried to set our house on fire.
He changed his mind. He didn't do it, did he?
What if he changes it back?
Walt, you need
to deal with this.
How much have you had to drink? Heh, heh.
Not nearly enough.
I don't know how we got off
on whatever it is we're talking about here...
but, clearly, I haven't explained the situation well enough
because this is a big overreaction.
We all need to just take a deep breath and calm down
because Jesse isn't just some...
Some-- Some rabid dog.
This is a person. A person that is a threat to us.
I mean, my God, where we are now with Hank and Marie
and that awful tape we made.
After everything we've done,
you can't just talk to this person.
You're saying...
that I just...
What--? What exactly are you saying?
We've come this far.
For us.
What's one more?
Jesse!
Stop what you're doing and turn and face me!
You wanna--? You wanna know what he did?
You wanna hear about it?
Jesse, put out the lighter.
He poisoned a little kid.
An 8-year-old boy.
Just because, you know--
Just as a move!
Walt's a bastard. Secret's out.
We'll talk about it.
But I need you to put out the lighter, okay?
Look, Jesse...
Jesse, I don't wanna kill you.
And you don't wanna be killed.
So put it out.
He can't keep getting away with it!
He can't keep getting away with it!
He won't.
You really wanna burn him down?
Let's do it together.
You were following me?
Yeah. Since Goodman's.
Where we going now?
DEA. Downtown.
What, I'm, like, arrested?
Yeah, you know how this works.
Be a good witness for me,
it'll go better for you.
Yeah, sitting around MDC,
waiting to be a witness against Mr. White.
It's... Heh.
It's gonna go great for me.
So...
you're angry.
I can't sleep. I'm not eating.
Last night, I was online for six hours looking up untraceable poisons.
This close family friend
had been keeping a secret from you and Hank,
and somehow this person's secret became known,
and now you're sad and hurt and angry.
I'm--? I'm in the ballpark?
To be this wrong about someone.
This off.
We all lead double lives to some extent, don't we?
We all have our secrets. Yeah. Not like this.
Not like him.
Marie, I think it's time you filled me in on some more details here.
Who and what are we talking about?
I said I can't do that.
It'd be bad for Hank.
Our friend made that clear in his little movie.
Those kids...
under his roof. That baby.
I'm sick just thinking about it.
How could I have not seen this?
If I weren't being such a...
idiotic-- Stupid idiot, I could've--
We could have...
Blackjack winnings.
Nothing suspicious about that at all.
Tell me about this movie.
Dave, can we simply
just focus on my feelings here?
The details don't really matter, do they? There's nothing to be done, okay?
He screwed us and he won.
Can we just...?
Can we talk about something else, please?
Yes?
How's work?
Last week, you were upset about the new parking rules.
Marie?
Saxitoxin.
Derived from shellfish.
Produces a flaccid paralysis that leaves the victim conscious
through a progression of symptoms.
Death occurs from respiratory failure.
That is definitely a contender.
Marie,
you're not ready to fill me in here,
that's fine.
But I want you to listen.
There is no problem, no matter how difficult
or painful or seemingly unsolvable,
that violence won't make worse.
I know, I...
Don't worry. I wouldn't hurt anybody.
I just...
It just feels good to think about it.
Hey, babe. What's the story here?
Oh, well, something's come up.
I thought you might wanna get out of the house for a day or two.
You thought I'd pack up and move out of my own house.
Why? What's going on?
Look, I don't wanna get into it now.
But you know that thing with Walt, there's...
There's been a development.
What happened? Are you in danger? No, no, no, not at all.
Just-- It's a fluid situation.
I think it might go a little smoother if you're not here.
So I... It's gonna be great, you know?
I booked you a spa package at La Posada.
You can do that river-stones thing. Hank, what the hell is going on?
Hank?
We have a guest.
He was a little keyed up. Gave him a couple sleeping pills.
Okay. Okay, so listen.
I bring that kid in, put him in the system,
Walt's gonna find out five minutes later. You know?
My last 10 witnesses died in jail, remember?
And I can't use a DEA safe house without writing him up.
I can't risk a motel.
I know it sounds crazy, but this is the best place.
For now. Just a day or two, tops--
Okay, just answer me this one question:
Is this bad for Walt?
Yeah. Very.
Good. I'm staying. I'll heat up lasagna.
Phone's ringing.
<i>You have one new message.</i>
<i>Jesse, listen. Uh...</i>
<i>I mean, obviously, you've changed your mind here</i>
<i>and so thank you for that.</i>
<i>And I know you're angry.</i>
<i>I wanna fix this, okay?</i>
<i>Whatever it takes, all right?</i>
<i>We'll talk, and we will fix this.</i>
<i>Until then, just...</i>
<i>Just sleep it off, okay?</i>
<i>And then call me.</i>
<i>Be safe.</i>
Hey.
Hey.
What are you still doing up?
Couldn't sleep.
Ah. You and me both. Here. Have a seat.
Everything okay? Oh, yeah.
Just business stuff.
Going over some options.
You guys still think you might buy another car wash?
Oh, uh-- Yeah. Well, maybe.
See how it goes.
How it goes now that--
Now that you're-- You're sick again, right?
No. That's not what I mean.
Hey. Told you not to worry, remember?
How--? How can I not worry?
Come on. You think I came all this way
just to let something as silly as lung cancer take me down?
Not a chance.
I'm not going anywhere.
Should've brought our suits, huh?
It's okay.
It's all right.
I'll be up in a minute.
Okay.
See you in the morning. Okay.
Would you like some coffee?
Morning.
You want some coffee?
No. The lady, um...
I think your wife...
You take cream and sugar?
Uh-- Black's-- Black's good.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thanks.
This is probably gonna take a while.
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll run some errands. Okay.
All right.
Uh... You remember Agent Gomez?
How you feeling? Your head clear? Yeah.
This-- This can't be what you mean by burning him to the ground, right?
I got stories that'll make your toes curl,
but, you know, it's just "my word against his word" kind of stuff.
So, you know, I don't really have any, like, proof or anything.
Gomey, can you grab the curtains over there?
There's a glare thing happening here.
You know he's retired, right? He's...
He's not even in the business anymore.
So you're never gonna catch him with a camcorder.
We're gonna catch him. We gotta do this first, okay? Come on.
Just tell us everything you remember.
Any business dealings, any personal dealings,
any criminal activity you were a witness or a party to.
Anything and everything.
Just tell us your story, okay?
Start from the beginning. When did you first meet Walter White?
Right. Okay, uh...
I first met Mr. White--
Walter White.
-in junior year chemistry.
He was my teacher.
You believe him?
Yeah. I do, unfortunately.
And I hate to admit it, but I think the kid is right.
There is no physical evidence, not that I heard.
Yeah, well, no weapons, no bodies, no working lab.
Just the word of one nut-job meth-head
against Mr. Rogers-Has-a-Lung-Tumor.
So do we take a run at Lydia Rodarte-Quayle?
Vamonos Pest? Follow up with the Drew Sharp killing?
Where do we start?
I say we start with this.
<i>Jesse...</i>
<i>I'm gonna be at Civic Plaza tomorrow at noon.</i>
<i>I hope you'll give me the chance to explain myself</i>
<i>and talk through everything once and for all.</i>
<i>I'll be alone and unarmed.</i>
<i>So if you wanna come and shoot me in the head, that's up to you.</i>
<i>Either way...</i>
<i>I'm in your hands.</i>
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go and talk to that asshole?
You can't be serious.
Go and listen. He wants to explain himself.
We put a wire on you and let him explain.
So your plan is to do his plan?
You seriously think that this--?
This whole "once and for all in the plaza" thing
is so he can talk to me?
Why not?
I-- I-- I can't believe you two.
The dude wanted me out of town before I came to burn his house down,
and now I'm more of a threat to him.
And he's got a zero-tolerance policy on threats, you know?
If I go to this plaza, I'm a dead man, is why not.
Hey, Walt's ruthless.
He'll do just about anything to protect his interests.
I agree. Except when it comes to you.
He cares about you. Heh.
Can't you see?
Oh, yeah. You mean when he's not ripping me off or calling me an idiot
or poisoning people that I care about?
Yeah, no, Mr. White's gay for me. Everyone knows that.
No, I mean it. Based on everything you told us.
Uh, he paid for your rehab,
ran over those two drug dealers with his car.
Sounds like he saved your life.
Made you a 50-50 partner. He didn't need to do that.
Yeah, he sort of did. I'm the only one near as good as him.
I don't know. The way you tell it,
sounds like he's manipulating you to stick around.
Like he doesn't wanna lose you. All those numbers he runs on you
over and over, helping you find the ricin cigarette.
Look how far he'll go to show you--
To convince you that he's not such a bad guy.
That's what this is. What if it's about, um,
killing me, you know?
You know, getting me out in the open,
hire some, uh-- Some clock-tower guy
or have me sit on a poisoned needle or something, you know?
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
The plaza's one of the most wide-open public places in all of Albuquerque.
It's the middle of the day.
And Agent Gomez and I will be right there with you.
Look, you two guys are just guys, okay?
Mr. White, he's the devil.
You know, he is. He is smarter than you,
he is luckier than you.
Whatever-- Whatever you think is supposed to happen,
I'm telling you, the exact reverse opposite of that
is gonna happen, okay?
Jesse, Jesse, we're not brainstorming here.
This is not asking.
Unless you know another way to get the man or you wanna take your chances
with the banger boys over in MDC, then this is it.
This is what's happening.
I gotta piss. Can I piss? Yeah. Down to the left.
You got another SD card?
What? What if the kid's right?
What if it's a trap?
The kid?
Oh, you mean the junkie murderer
that's dribbling all over my guest bathroom floor?
Well, then, he's right.
Pinkman gets killed,
and we get it all on tape.
Remember, you're hurt, angry, but you're here for answers, okay?
But don't... Don't push the questions.
Okay? Let's not get him suspicious, all right?
You let him do the talking, right?
Just relax. That's what matters most.
Don't cross your arms, if you can help it.
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.
<i>Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek. You getting that?</i>
Loud and clear, <i>idiota. How's it looking, Gomey?</i>
No change.
<i>He's just sitting there.</i>
<i>Are we doing this, or what?</i>
Ready to kick some ass, partner?
All right. Time to go.
Okay.
Hey, Hank, you got eyes on this? What's with the kid?
He's just standing there.
<i>What the hell is he doing?</i>
He's on the move now. He's taking off. I think he's running.
Oh, no, no, no, kid. Come on.
You got him? He's at the pay phone.
Who the hell is he calling?
Oh, no, no, no. Come on, kid.
No. Come on.
Hello?
Nice try, asshole.
Jesse, where are you?
I just wanna talk.
No. I'm not doing what you want anymore. Okay, asshole?
<i>This is just a heads-up to let you know I'm coming for you.</i>
See, I decided that burning down your house is nothing.
Next time, I'm gonna get you where you really live.
Jesse, listen.
Jesse? Jesse?
Daddy! Daddy! Hey!
Get in.
Son of a bitch! Stupid, high little--
What the hell was that all about?
What were you thinking?
Thinking there's another way. What?
To get him. There's another way.
A better way.
Hey.
It's Walt.
I'm okay.
I, uh...
Todd...
I think I might have another job for your uncle.
ï»¿1
How big's the batch?
Should be about 50 pounds, give or take.
Uncle Jack, that mask,
I think you should...
Mr. White said the fumes aren't good to breathe.
Let me worry about what I breathe, kid.
Just hurry this up so I can grab a smoke. Ahem.
Seventy-six percent. Ha.
Nice going, nephew. Thanks, Uncle Jack.
Where's the blue?
Where's the what? The blue color.
Does it come later, when this hardens?
Where is it?
I am correct in assuming this should be blue?
See, I'm thinking the headline here should be "76 percent."
Yeah. Whole lot more than it was.
That dude who looked like Wolverine? He couldn't crack 70.
Fine. Yes, percentage-wise, it's marginally improved.
And congratulations, Todd.
But blue is our brand, all over Europe.
It's what our buyers pay top dollar for.
If we're down a bit in purity from the Heisenberg days,
maybe they'll let us slide on that, but not if it's not blue.
I don't know. To my eye,
it's kind of blue. Yeah, a little.
It's bluish.
Todd, you're the chef. What do you think?
Yeah, kind of.
If it catches the light just right,
I could see how you'd think there's a touch of blue,
blue-green in there.
Aquamarine.
Hell, we'll put food coloring in it. Make it any damn shade you want.
Yeah, like they do farm-raised salmon. Yeah.
I mean, Jesus, you ever see how pink they make that crap?
Like, flamingo pink.
It sure as hell don't come out the ocean looking like that.
All right. Let's make some money.
Here you go, Ms. Quayle. Lydia.
Thank you.
Is the tea okay? I made it just like you asked.
Mm-hm.
You sure? If it's too weak or something, I can go put another bag in it.
I'm sure.
Look, about the product,
I'm really sorry about the color.
For a minute or two, it just got a few degrees too hot
in the mixing kettle, I think.
I might've just cooked the color right out of it.
You burned it, like a cake.
Yeah, sort of, I guess.
But the point is I think I can fix it,
and I think I can bring the purity up too.
I mean, I'm doing everything just like Mr. White taught me, so...
You know, it's bound to get better, right?
I appreciate you making every possible effort
because, as you know, my buyers expect a certain threshold,
a continuity.
Yeah. Yeah, totally.
About your buyers,
I could ask my uncle to smooth things over with them,
if you want.
I'll pass. Thanks.
I've put a lot of faith in your abilities, Todd.
I believe in you.
Please do make the cook better.
It's very important to me.
I've got a flight to catch.
Hello. <i>Hey. It's Walt.</i>
Hey, Mr. White. How you doing?
<i>I'm okay.</i>
<i>I, uh...</i>
<i>Todd, I think I might have anotherjob for your uncle.</i>
Oh, okay. You want me to set up a meeting?
<i>I-- Yes. Please. Let's do that.</i>
Any heads-up I should give him, like
which jail, how many targets, stuff like that?
Mr. White? <i>Just one target.</i>
<i>Not currently in jail.</i>
<i>Jesse Pinkman.</i>
You got it.
I'm surprised you didn't strangle him. So now what? Book him?
I'm sure the AUSA will have plenty to say about how to play him against Walt.
Knowing what we know about how Walt deals with rats behind bars?
Punk has to be safer with the marshals
than out here where it's open season.
What does that mean? What are you thinking?
The kid's got an idea.
What kid? That kid? Timmy Dipshit there?
The one that screwed up our sting? I'm all ears.
Just hear him out, would you?
Okay, genius, what's the idea?
You guys need evidence to put him away.
Only he's too smart to leave any out there, right?
So you say.
Well, I know some evidence
that greedy asshole would never destroy.
His money.
You know where he keeps his money? No.
But I know someone who might.
Oh, hey. How'd it go?
Trailed him to the Dog House, picked him up there.
Seemed to be looking for someone. Had a lot of questions.
No calls though, right?
You got his phone? Yeah.
He's on ice? Safe house off Rio Bravo.
We've got Van Oster babysitting him.
Yeah. What about Van Oster? Did he have any questions?
Probably, but he knows better than to ask.
Good job.
I gotta tell you this up front, Hank.
If this guy decides he wants to lawyer up,
I don't care if you are my boss, I'm gonna put a stop to this.
He won't lawyer up.
What the hell, man?
You're up.
Hey there. You mind taking it outside for a minute?
No, sir. You got it. All right, thanks.
Huell Babineaux.
Know who I am?
I'll take that as a yes.
Thanks for your patience.
Uh, as Agent Gomez said, you're not under arrest.
Why am I here?
Well, you're here, um, for your own protection, sir.
How you figure that?
Well, we both know how dangerous my brother-in-law can be.
Nice poker face.
Look, uh, relax.
There's not much new you can tell me about Walter White.
Multiple murders,
ties to a white-power prison gang,
ran the largest meth racket in the entire Southwest.
I'm not asking, you're not answering,
whoop-de-do. Let's cut to the chase.
We have a wire on Walt's phone.
We intercepted a call between him and a certain Saul Goodman, Esq.
You know, your employer?
Anyway, in the call, Walt said that he was going to, quote:
"Take care of one Jesse Pinkman," unquote,
and that you were next on the hit list. That's why you're here.
Bullshit. That don't make no sense.
I got the recording. I can-- I can let you hear it.
Your associate, Goodman's fixer-- What's his name?
Some carrottop named Patrick Kuby.
Boston P.D. ran him out of Beantown a few years back.
Came out here for the sunshine.
Walt said he was gonna do this Kuby guy the same way he does you.
In fact, Kuby's already missing.
Sorry to say, things are looking grim for your-- Your redheaded buddy.
Believe us, don't believe us. Suit yourself.
Whatever you do, I would not call Goodman.
He sold you down the river bigtime.
The hell you talking about?
Don't take it personally.
Goodman's next on the chopping block if he doesn't do what White says.
To be fair, your circus clown of a boss did try to spare you for all of, what,
about, uh, 15 seconds,
before he decided to help Walt track you down.
You see, Goodman's got a trace on your phone,
and as soon as you call him,
Walt will find out where you're hiding.
Then it's just a matter of time before you end up like this.
Oh, man. Oh, man. I swear to God, I didn't know he was gonna kill him, man.
I didn't know he was gonna kill him. Relax.
If we thought you did, you'd be in lockup
for conspiracy to commit murder instead of under our protection.
Tell us everything you know so we can get him before he gets you.
Why would he wanna kill me?
I ain't do nothing. Who knows with this guy?
From what he said, it may have to do
with him tying up loose ends regarding poisoning some kid named Brock.
Or maybe it's because you know where his money is.
I don't know where his money is.
That ain't what we heard.
You ain't listening to the people in the know.
Me and Kuby rented a van for the dude,
loaded his cash up in a self-storage unit,
handed over the keys to him at Goodman's.
Who knows where he took it from there?
A van, huh? How much money we talking?
Seven barrels' worth.
Seven barrels?
When you say "barrels," you mean "barrels" barrels?
Barrels, man. You know, plastic, black, 55-gallon type.
I got them at Home Depot.
Filled up every last damn one of them too.
And, uh, where did you rent the van?
Lariat. The one on Candelaria and Monroe.
Lariat on Candelaria? Yeah.
Kuby rented the van. Mr. White dropped it off.
He had us wash it good before Kuby took it back.
Wash the rental? Why?
It was filthy, man, like he went off-road with it.
After we had hosed it down, he grabbed a shovel out the back,
handed over the key, and that was it.
That's all I know.
All right, Mr. Babineaux.
Agent Gomez and I are going to do everything we can
to find this son of a bitch.
Like I said, you're free to go.
But if I were you, I wouldn't take one step out that door.
And remember, no phone calls.
Oh, actually, I almost forgot.
Uh, I took the liberty of removing the battery
so Walt can't track you by GPS.
So don't put that back in.
Agent Van Oster will stay here with you.
You're in good hands. He's our best man with a gun.
Uh, don't discuss the case with him because the less you distract him,
the better he can protect you.
How long you gonna be?
As long as it takes to keep you safe.
So just one guy this time.
Not even in lockup.
Some former partner, Todd says?
Yeah.
So, what are we talking, rat patrol?
Rat p--?
No, no.
Rat patrol? No. No, he's not a rat.
He's just...
He just won't listen to reason.
Okay. He's just angry.
He's not a rat.
All right.
Angry non-rat. Got it.
How angry we talking, by the way?
Like, Hulk angry?
Like, Rambo-James Bond badass individual?
Not something you'd do yourself, huh?
Jesse is like family to me.
Look, I want what you do to be quick and painless.
No suffering, no fear.
Bullet to the back of the head. Something he doesn't see coming.
I respect that.
There's too many savages out there. Let's just talk about the money.
No, we don't want your money.
We want you to cook for us.
You know I'm out of the business.
Just a couple times to tutor my nephew here, that's all.
Get him on track to bringing the purity up.
Get the color right too.
Apparently that blue touch you put on it,
it's all the craze with those Slavic types.
So I'm told. No.
Absolutely not.
Look, what was the price per head last time? I'll triple it.
A drop in the bucket compared to what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.
Don't skimp on family, that's what I always say.
You want us to do this job?
Do it right? That's the price.
One cook,
after the job is done.
Time is of the essence. Do you understand?
Do him tonight if you want.
Just tell me where he is.
I don't know where he is,
but I know how to flush him out.
You want string cheese or yogurt squeezers with your PBJ?
Both.
I didn't hear you. Both, please.
Hold on, honey.
Hi, Andrea. I don't know if you remember me.
I'm Walter White, Jesse's friend.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. Hi. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, hi. Hi.
I'm sorry to just barge in on you like this,
but, uh, I was hoping that I could have a moment to talk with you.
It's about Jesse.
Um, sure. I'm sort of rushing around right now.
Wanna talk inside while I get my boy ready?
Oh, well, yeah. If it's-- If it's okay, yeah, sure.
Thank you.
You met Brock before, right? Yes. Yes, I have. At Jesse's.
How you doing, Brock?
Brock, he asked you a question.
I'm good. Good.
Froot Loops.
That's good stuff.
So Jesse...
Yeah, I...
I don't wanna alarm you,
but I've been trying to reach him for days.
I've stopped at his house,
I've left all kinds of messages on his voicemail,
and he won't return my calls. I can't find him anywhere.
Have you heard from him?
No, not since the last time he called to check on Brock.
That was, I don't know,
two weeks ago, maybe.
Andrea,
Jesse's using again, and I...
I have a bad feeling about this.
Have you tried calling the police?
Or a better idea.
Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman. I have his card somewhere.
I mean, he may have ways of finding Jesse without getting him in trouble.
"Better call Saul." Yeah. I-- I did that.
He was able to verify that Jesse's not locked up,
but, otherwise, very little help.
You see, the thing is,
is that Jesse and I had this argument recently.
And I won't bore you with the details, but he's...
He's-- He's pretty upset with me and, um...
And I'm hoping that's the reason he hasn't called me back
instead of him being...
Well...
Well, I'll try him right now.
I mean, if that's it, he's mad at you,
maybe I'll have better luck. That would be such a help. Yes.
What--? What--? What number are you calling him on?
His cell. You know, he recently got a new one.
And there. That--
That's his new number there, the highlighted one.
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.
Your friend Walter just dropped by. He's here at the house right now.
We-- We're thinking of you.
Call me back as soon as you get this message.
I really need to hear from you.
It's important.
Thank you, Andrea.
I appreciate that.
Well, I better-- I better be going.
You're welcome to stay a few minutes to see if he calls back.
No, no, no. You're trying to get your son off to school.
If he does happen to call back, would you call me?
Better yet, I've got your number. I'll call you back, okay?
And thank you.
See you, Brock.
We on?
Yes. It should be any time now.
<i>Copy that.</i>
Remember, fast and painless. And take him away from here.
I don't want the mother or the boy to know.
<i>You got it.</i>
<i>Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.</i>
<i>Your friend Walterjust dropped by. He's here at the house right now.</i>
<i>We-- We're thinking of you.</i>
<i>Call me back as soon as you get this message.</i>
<i>I really need to hear from you.</i>
<i>It's important.</i>
Nice try, asshole.
How'd it go at the rental place? Van have GPS?
No GPS. Nope.
They used to have GPS until about six months ago
when the ACLU or somebody sued them
and they had to get rid of it.
Well, that's it. Game over.
Yo, man, you can't just give up on this.
Who said we're giving up? What do you got?
Just thinking about what Babineaux said
about the van being dirty
and the shovel that Walt had with him.
I'll bet you 10-to-1 he buried that money.
No kidding. So what?
There's a whole lot of desert out there. How we gonna find the spot?
You said it yourself, there's no GPS on the van.
Yeah. But Walt doesn't know that.
All right.
Here's your change.
Oh, count it out, please. Here.
Uh, three. That makes 15.
Plus 5, that is 20.
Give this to your car wash professional. Thank you.
Say it.
Have an A-1 day. Oh, you too.
Good. Why--? Why do I--?
Who do I gotta say that?
Because it reinforces our brand.
So getting the hang of it?
It's, uh-- It's pretty basic.
Mom, it's Saturday.
Can--? Can I go?
Go where? Home.
Pick up a few things, maybe chill for a little bit.
I'm sure the smell is gone by now.
Why don't you just stick around here for a while longer?
I need you. Hi.
Uh, who do I give this to? Um...
You know what? I'll take care of it. Excuse me, son.
That'll be 14.97, please.
Hey. How you doing?
You're on our billboard. You're--
You're the lawyer guy, yeah. "Better call Saul!"
Heh, heh.
Okay.
So 3 makes 15, and 20, 25, 30,
35, 40, and 10 makes 50. Thank you.
I like your commercial.
What--? What happened to your face?
Oh, this is a-- I guess you'd call it an occupational hazard.
Thank you, and please give that to your car wash professional.
Very good. Thank you very much. Good to meet you.
Yeah. Don't drink and drive.
Okay. But if you do, call me.
Ahem. Have an A-1 day.
Mom, you forgot to say it.
Yeah. Yeah, I did. Okay.
Make sure you get in there between the cushions, all right?
That's it. Way in there. Attaboy.
What the hell you doing here?
I swear to God, the kid left so much booger powder in there
my Caddy is a K-9 unit's wet dream.
Is your phone broken? All 200 of them?
Huell's gone.
Huell's gone where?
No idea. AWOL. Nobody's seen him. He's not answering his phone.
So, what about Jesse?
He hasn't shown up yet.
He will, Saul. He's probably high as a kite
and hasn't gotten our message yet.
Or he got it loud and clear, figured out it's a setup.
The kid is not as dumb as you think.
Are you wearing a bulletproof vest?
Did you miss the part about my bodyguard has gone missing?
Look, I had him watching the Dog House,
figuring the kid might show up.
Next thing I know, radio silence.
You're the math whiz. Add up two and two.
Jesse is not on some killing spree.
It's me he wants.
It's just me.
Well, then where the hell's Huell?
Any news? Not yet, but soon. I promise.
Have an A-1 day.
Next,
inventory lists.
These are the inventory lists. Every day, after close of business,
you tally the total of every item sold
and you mark it under the appropriate column.
So say we sold, I don't know, 10 pine-scented air fresheners.
You mark "10" under this column
and then you subtract 10 from the stock column.
Okay? Why don't you try that?
Jesse?
<i>Got my photo, bitch?</i>
<i>That barrel look familiar?</i>
<i>Because I just found six more exactly like it.</i>
<i>That big bastard who works for Goodman,</i>
<i>I pistol-whipped that melon he calls a head</i>
<i>till he gave up what he knew, which led me to your rental van,</i>
<i>which, it turns out, had GPS.</i>
<i>How do you like that, genius? Guess you didn't think of everything.</i>
Look, Jesse, I don't know what you plan on doing here, but--
<i>Well, I'll give you a hint, Walt.</i>
<i>It involves a couple of five-gallon cans of gasoline and a lighter.</i>
No, no, no! Jesse, please, listen to me.
<i>No, you listen to me, bitch.</i>
<i>You get your ass out here as fast as you can.</i>
Yes, I'm coming. Okay! Okay!
<i>And don't even think about calling anyone for help, all right?</i>
<i>You hang up on me, put me on hold,</i>
<i>lose my call for any reason,</i>
<i>as soon as you do, I'm burning all of it.</i>
<i>All right? One big bonfire. You get the picture?</i>
I get it, I get it. Okay. <i>All right. You better hurry,</i>
<i>because I'm burning 10 grand a minute</i>
<i>till you get here, starting right now.</i>
I said, I'm coming! Don't you touch my money!
<i>Fire in the hole, bitch. There goes 10 G's.</i>
<i>Oh, nice orange flames.</i> No, no, no!
Jesse-- Jesse, please.
I'm dying. My cancer is back.
You're not hurting anyone but my family. Okay?
I can't spend this money.
It's not for me. I won't be around long enough to use it.
It belongs to my children.
<i>Oh, you're gonna talk about kids.</i>
<i>You're seriously gonna go there?</i>
I am sorry about Brock.
<i>No, you're not.</i>
I am. <i>You're not, but you're gonna be.</i>
Yes, I am sorry about Brock!
But he's alive, isn't he?
He's fine, just as I planned it!
Don't you think I knew exactly how much to give him?
That I had it all measured out? Come on!
Don't you know me by now? <i>I know you're a lying, evil scumbag,</i>
<i>that's what I know.</i>
<i>Manipulating people,</i>
<i>messing with their heads.</i> Open your eyes!
Can't you see that I needed you on my side to kill Gus?
I ran over those gangbangers!
I killed Emilio and Krazy-8! Why?
I did all of those things to try to save your life
as much as mine.
Only you're too stupid to know it!
Jesse.
Jesse!
Jesse, talk to me.
Jesse!
Jesse, I didn't hang up! Jesse!
Jesse?
Jesse, I'm here. Where are you?
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch!
No. No. No, no, no.
Come on, come on.
Yes.
Yeah?
It's me. I've got Jesse in sight,
and he's coming for me right now.
<i>He knows I'm alone.</i>
Let's go, boy. <i>I'm guessing he's got backup.</i>
How many guys? <i>I do-- I-- I don't know.</i>
Where are you? <i>To'hajiilee.</i>
<i>An Indian reservation west of town.</i>
<i>Get a pen.</i> Go.
Okay.
Okay.
"Thirty-four, 59, 20,
<i>106, 36, 52."</i>
Those are coordinates.
<i>If you want me around to cook for you,</i>
you get here now. <i>You got it.</i>
As fast as you can. Okay. Wait.
They're coming.
Looks like there could be three men total.
Wait a minute.
What? What is it?
Stay in the car.
Oh, my God.
<i>Walter, what is it?</i>
<i>Walter, you still there?</i>
<i>Walter?</i>
<i>Walter, you got eyes on him?</i>
<i>What do you see?</i>
<i>Walter, talk to me.</i>
Forget it.
Don't come.
What do you mean, "don't come"?
<i>It's off.</i>
Do not come.
Walt!
Come on out!
Walt!
Walt!
I know you're out here!
It's over!
Walt!
Come on out, Walt!
Got him.
Drop it!
Hands up!
Walk towards me slowly!
Stop.
Turn around.
Lace your fingers behind your head.
Walk backwards to me.
Stop.
Get on your knees.
How'd you like my barrel photo, huh?
Took it in the backyard by the barbecue grill.
You know, where we used to cook out with the family.
Gomey thought the dirt might not match. But me?
I bet your greedy ass would be so worked up
about the prospect of losing your cash
that you wouldn't catch it.
Looks like I was right.
He's clean.
Yo, I remember this place.
It's the very first place we cooked, like, ever.
It is, isn't it?
Hey, what say you save us the busywork, Walt,
and point out the spot where you buried your money?
No?
No matter.
I'll get a search team out here. We'll find it.
Agent Gomez, should we flip a coin for the honors?
No way, man. It's all yours.
Walter White,
you have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you
in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an attorney
and have an attorney present during questioning.
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you at the government's expense.
Do you understand these rights as I have just recited them to you?
Coward.
Get-- Get over here!
Bring it!
Get in the truck, will you? Bring it, bitch!
Put him in the car! Come on! Come on!
Get in the car! Hurry up!
Get in the car, kid. Come on.
Gonna take him down for booking, okay?
You should stay here till I come back with a search team.
You got it. I'd take the kid with me,
but they'd probably kill each other on the way.
Congratulations, buddy. Hey.
I'll call the tribal police, let them know we're here.
Gonna make a phone call.
Hank, why is there what looks like brains in our garbage can?
Hey, baby. I got him.
Dead to rights.
You got Walt? <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>I got him in handcuffs as we speak.</i>
<i>Want me to wave to him for you?</i>
Heh, heh. Well, he's not--
He's not feeling too friendly.
Oh, my God.
You did it.
Thank God.
Things are gonna be a little rough for the next couple weeks,
but they'll get better.
Baby, you okay?
I'm much better now.
I gotta go.
It may be a while before I get home.
I love you.
I love you too.
Who the hell is this?
Tribal police?
Hank! Hank! Hank!
No--
Police! Drop your weapons!
Jack, don't do it!
Jack!
Drop your weapons!
You heard the man! Put them down!
How do we know you're cops?
Show us some ID!
Damn straight! Let's see some badges!
Jack!
Jack, don't do it!
Jack!
No, Jack, it's off! Jack!
We'll give ourselves up, you show us some badges!
Simple as that!
How about it?
No!
Jack!
Jack, it's off! Forget it!
Jack!

Yo, so, what's next?
We wait.
We don't got like eight more anal things we gotta do first?
The reaction has begun.
Yeah, I know. So how long?
Well, if we had a freezer, the condensed liquid would cool more quickly
because, of course, this is an exothermic reaction, which means
"giving off heat."
And our desired product is...
Put me into a coma, why don't you?
What did you just say?
What? What? Nothing.
Huh.
No, no, no. Not in here.
Duh. Like I'm an idiot.
Yeah. Like you're an idiot.
Dick.
Aah.
God. Jesus. God.
Shut up.
Oh, wow.
Bogdan. Bogdan says I'm not doing the receipts right.
Well, he's got a bug up his butt.
He's got a stick up his butt?
He's got a bug up his butt about the receipts, anyways.
So anyway, he's insisting that I--
He's demanding that I stay
and look over his system
and I cannot get out of it.
Yeah.
Hello. <i>Hi, honey. It's me.</i>
Hey, you. What's going on? <i>Nothing much.</i>
I was just calling to say I'm sorry
but I'm gonna be late tonight.
Bogdan. He's got a bug up his butt.
That's okay. I wasn't planning anything special for dinner, so...
In fact, you could take pity on us and bring a pizza home.
They're having a two-for-one at Venezia's.
At this point, I could eat a whole one by myself.
Yeah, yeah, sure. I can pick up a pizza.
Hopefully Bogdan won't keep me too late.
He better not. Trust me, he does not want to piss off a hungry pregnant woman.
Ooh, what's that sound? <i>I just sold your favorite piece.</i>
The hideous crying clown. <i>Wow.</i>
Yeah, and I got 9 bucks more than I paid for it.
Shows what I know about art.
<i>Hey, what do you think about Holly?</i>
<i>For the baby's name.</i>
Do you like it?
I think I really like it.
Holly. Yeah, it's nice.
Let me think about it.
Just feels right, you know? It's my new favorite.
Well, it's a front-runner, for sure.
Listen, I was thinking, um, maybe we can have a little family time this weekend.
<i>Oh, yeah?</i> Yeah.
You know, just take a drive.
The almost four of us. Ha-ha-ha.
<i>Maybe we can head up the Turquoise Trail,</i>
<i>stop at Tinkertown, maybe grab some lunch in Madrid.</i>
Oh, my God. We haven't been there in forever.
<i>I know.</i> Yeah.
<i>So why don't we just do that? Take a little break?</i>
<i>Sold. Sounds fun.</i>
Holly. It's growing on me.
Yep. Me too.
All right, well, I had better go and get this in the mail.
<i>Why don't you call me when you're on your way home?</i>
Will do. Love you. <i>Love you too.</i>
Whoa, simmer down there, sparky.
What the hell did we just walk into?
Hey, Uncle Jack, I don't see Jesse Pinkman.
He was right here before.
Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?
No.
What do you figure? He maybe headed down that gully there?
That's the way I'd go.
Frankie, Lester, go find him.
Jack.
These guys are DEA.
No! Jack, no!
Jack! Jack! Jack!
No! No, don't!
Jack, don't. No.
No, Jack, Jack, Jack! Jack, no!
Jack, no. Don't kill him. Uh-uh-uh. Back it up.
Don't kill him, Jack. Get back here.
The hell not? He's DEA.
No, he's family.
Say again?
He's my family.
He's my brother-in-law.
Didn't cross your mind to maybe tell us
you had a DEA agent for a brother-in-law?
Did you know about this? I called you off, remember?
I told you not to come. Well, it seems to me we did you a solid.
You weren't supposed to be here.
Too late now.
How's about you telling me what was going down out here? Hm?
You and your brother-in-law don't seem to be getting along too well.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't concern you.
We just wasted his partner here, and he's wearing a bullet,
so, yeah, I'd say it does concern me.
This is between him and me.
No cavalry coming?
No.
You bet your ass the cavalry's coming.
No, no, no! Jack--
Jack! No, the DEA doesn't know about this.
Not yet.
Hank.
Nothing can change what just happened,
but you can walk out of here alive
if you just promise us that you'll let this go.
Yeah, I thought as much.
Sorry, man. Just no scenario where this guy lives.
No, no, no, listen! I have money!
I have money! It's buried out here. It's...
It's $80 million.
Eighty million.
Hm. So that's what got this party started, huh?
But this money of yours won't do me much good in prison.
You can go anywhere. You can do anything. Think about it.
You can have any future that you want.
Jack.
Eighty million.
And all you've got to do
is let him go.
That's a hell of an offer.
What do you think, fed?
Would you take that deal?
It's Hank.
His name is Hank.
How about it, Hank?
Should I let you go?
My name is ASAC Schrader.
And you can go fuck yourself.
Hank, listen to me.
You gotta tell him.
You gotta tell him now that we can work this out.
Please. Please.
What? You want me to beg?
You're the smartest guy I ever met.
And you're too stupid to see...
he made up his mind 10 minutes ago.
Do what you're gonna do.
Pretty specific directions.
Most people tell me to be somewhere, they say, "West on the 40,
this or that exit, second gas station on the left." You know?
This here? This is a whole other story.
That fancy phone of yours, where does it say this is exactly?
Yeah.
Look at this. They even brought a shovel.
Jack, no sign of Pinkman.
All right.
Says this is it right here.
Dig.
What's that? A barrel? Couple barrels?
Oh, Jesus.
Hell, yeah!
Oh, Jesus. Would you look at that? Ha-ha-ha.
Hell, yeah!
Goddamn.
Whoo!
What are you waiting for?
Yeah, boss. Hell, yeah.
Let me get on this side. Get that out of there, man.
Okay. Pull a barrel off the truck and load it in the Chrysler.
Seriously? Jack.
That's like 10 or 11 million right there. You sure you wanna do that?
You gonna make me say it again? Go, go.
Chop, chop.
Jesus, what's with all the greed here?
It's unattractive.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm leaving you a barrel.
Boys are gonna load it for you.
You got the keys to these cuffs?
I'm sorry for your loss.
My nephew here, he respects you.
He would never forgive me if things went another way.
Also you caught me in a good mood.
So here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna get in your car,
and you're gonna drive out of here, all right?
No hard feelings.
Understand me?
We square?
Hey, man, I gotta know we're square, or we're gonna have to go that other way.
Pinkman.
Pinkman.
You still owe me.
If you can find him, we'll kill him.
Found him.
No!
Get off me!
Get off!
No, no.
Good to go?
Hey, Uncle Jack.
Well, he was out here with those feds.
Right? Working with them. Should we maybe find out what he told them first?
Because, I mean, he had to have told them some stuff
that might not be too good for us.
And I'll bet we could
get it out of him back home.
I mean, I can do it.
Me and him, we got history.
And then, you know, we'd take care of the job after that.
Works for me. Work for you?
Let's go, pal. No.
No!
No!
No!
Wait.
I watched Jane die.
I was there.
And I watched her die.
I watched her overdose and choke to death.
I could have saved her.
But I didn't.
Hi. Hello.
That truck belong to you?
It does.
I'd like to buy it.
It's not for sale.
Hey, Walt, it's me. Um,
just thought I'd try you again.
We were just wondering when you thought you'd be back,
so just give us a call whenever you can.
Bye.
Hey, Aunt Marie.
Hey, sweetie.
Haven't seen you for a while. What have you been up to?
Oh, you know. This and that.
Your mom and I need to talk, so thought I'd stop by.
Well, I, uh, wish you'd called first.
This isn't the best time.
Well, Flynn looks like he can hold down the fort.
Why don't we go into your office?
I got it.
Okay, honey. Thanks.
Marie, I have nothing to say. Well, I do.
So you can just sit there and listen.
I got a call from Hank. He arrested Walt
three hours ago.
It's over.
"Dead to rights" I believe is the expression.
Hank and Steve Gomez are working with a former associate of Walt's,
Jesse Pinkman, whom I know you know,
and Pinkman has supplied them with everything they need.
Hank is booking Walt as we speak.
And I, for one, could not be happier.
I almost didn't come here.
Christ, I barely even know who you are,
and I sure as hell don't know if I can ever trust you again.
And then I think about how you were so upset with Walt
and how you wanted the kids out of the house,
and all of this makes me believe that there has got to be hope for you,
that whatever he did to you can be undone.
All I know, all I have been forcing myself to remember,
is that you are my sister.
And so I'm here.
Marie-- Everything changes now.
And you have got to prepare yourself.
Hank will help you as much as he can. I know he will.
And I will support you through this.
But I have conditions.
Give me every single copy of that obscenity
that the two of you made to discredit Hank.
That DVD. Every single copy.
You understand me?
Answer me. Do you understand me?
Yes.
Good.
Now dry your eyes and get Flynn in here.
You are going to tell him everything, and I mean everything.
He deserves to know the truth from his family.
Not a bunch of uniformed strangers.
No. No. No, he cannot know. You tell him,
or I will.
There's no way around this.
He needs to know, and he needs to know now.
No.
Look, I gave you what you wanted.
Come on, please.
Hey, please.
I told you where to find the tape, okay? Yup.
Hey, just go.
Just go there. Just go to his house and get it.
We're on it. Get it!
No one else knows about it. Just me and his partner.
Okay. No one else knows, I swear!
Let's cook.
You're completely out of your mind.
It's the truth. It is, Flynn.
Then both of you are out of your minds.
You're full of shit, is what you are. Both of you.
If this is true, then how could you keep this a secret?
I mean, why? Why would you go along?
I'll be asking myself that for the rest of my life.
So you're saying all this time you were lying about this?
I mean, so you're saying you're a liar.
You just admitted it.
So were you lying then, or are you lying now?
Which lie is it?
Flynn, honey,
your mother is telling you the truth.
Right here, right now. Believe it.
You know what? This is bullshit. This is bullshit.
Baby-- I wanna talk to Dad.
Your dad's in custody. You can't talk to him for a while.
I'm calling Uncle Hank. I've tried. He's not answering.
He's probably in the thick of it
with your father. Honey, I know this is a lot to process, Flynn,
but if you could just breathe, just try to breathe
and just trust-- Really? Really? Try to breathe?
Oh, my God.
Go home.
Just take the kids home, okay? Go home and regroup.
I'll stop by later.
Flynn?
Could you put your seatbelt on, please?
Please. It's not safe.
You're shitting me, right?
If all this is true and you knew about it,
then you're as bad as him.
Whose truck is that?
Dad?
Listen, I need you to come inside and pack right now.
Mom, Aunt Marie,
they said that you were arrested? No, just--
You're some kind of drug dealer?
No, just come inside, please. Now.
Come inside. Come on.
Go, go, go.
Dad, stop. Just talk to me, please. Our priority right now is to pack.
Uncle Hank, they said he arrested you? I will discuss all of this later, okay?
Just tell me what--
Just listen to me!
Go into your bedroom now, grab anything important.
You understand? Go. Now. Both of you. Go.
Walt.
Why are you here?
Skyler, please, will you just go get your things?
For you and the kids. Now. This is our priority.
Hank had you in custody. He wouldn't just let you go.
Where is he? I--
Where's Hank? I...
I negotiated--
Negotiated? Yes.
What does that mean?
It means we're fine, okay?
We are. We're fine. Everything is gonna be fine,
but we need to leave right now.
All right? Can we do that?
What happened?
Where is Hank?
Why do we need to leave?
I need both of you to trust me.
Right now, okay?
Please, just work with me here,
and I promise I will explain everything later, okay?
Where is Hank?
Skyler.
I have $11 million in cash right outside.
We can have a fresh start.
Whole new lives.
All we have to do is go.
We have to go right now.
That's all we have to do.
You killed him.
You killed Hank.
What? No, no, no.
You killed him. Aah! No, no, no!
I tried to save him.
Uncle Hank is dead? I--
Mom, it can't be true. It just can't be true. Just stop, please.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise, but we need to leave right now.
Dad, what's going on? Talk to me.
Just stop for one second.
Look, I told you to get your things.
Stop walking away.
There is no time.
Tell me about Uncle Hank.
No, just drop it!
But what's wrong with you?
We're going. We're going right now.
You have to tell me. Dad, wait.
What happened to Uncle Hank? What--?
Get out.
Skyler, I promise you, we will figure this out.
Enough. Mom,
what are you doing?
Skyler, put the knife down, please.
I promise you, everything-- Don't say one more word.
Get out of here now.
Skyler-- Get out!
Stop it! Just stop! Just stop!
Let go! Let go! Get away from us!
Just stop! Stop!
Dad, stop it! Stop!
Mom, stop it.
Stop, Dad. Stop it now. Stop.
Stop! Just, please, stop!
Stop it! Stop! Stop it!
What the hell is wrong with you?! We're a family!
We're a family.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Yeah, I need the police.
My dad, he pulled a knife on my mom.
He attacked her. He's dangerous.
I think he might have killed somebody.
Yeah.
He's still here.
Yeah, he's still in the house.
We're at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.
308 Negra Arroyo Lane! You've gotta come quick.
Hurry, hurry. Oh, God, no, no!
Oh, my God. No.
Walt, no! Walt! Mom!
Walt, please, no!
No! No! No!
Walt, no! Let her go!
You can't take her!
Let her go, please! You can't take her!
Let her go! Walt!
Walt, please, no!
Walt, no! Walt, please!
Walt, no!
Walt, please, no!
Walt, please!
Please, stop! Walt!
Say, "Da-da."
Da-da. You say, "Da-da"?
There. Get rid of that stinky old diaper, huh?
Don't be sad. Where's your belly button?
Where's your belly button?
There. Now, don't you feel better?
You're all nice and dry. Huh?
That feels good? Oh, I know.
You were so wet and so cranky, but now you feel better, don't you?
Next order of business is to get you a brand-new car seat.
Won't that be nice, Holly?
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
Confirming the abduction.
Amber Alert. Holly White.
Female, 18 months.
Blond hair, blue eyes.
Was last seen wearing a pink and white jacket, pink pants.
Abductor is the father...
He was in handcuffs. Hank had him in handcuffs.
Bald head, goatee, gold, wire-framed glasses.
Are you expecting a call?
<i>Hi, you've reached the White family. Please leave a message.</i>
<i>Skyler, it's me. Pick up. Pick up.</i>
That's him. That's my husband. <i>I need you to pick up the phone.</i>
Start a trace on the landline.
The number's 505-177-8987. <i>I know you're there, so pick it up.</i>
<i>Skyler, you hear me?</i>
Need the location of an incoming caller.
<i>Answer the pho--</i>
Walt, where's Holly?
<i>Are you alone?</i>
<i>No police?</i>
No. No police.
Where are you? Where's Holly?
Walt! <i>What the hell is wrong with you?</i>
<i>Why can't you do one thing I say?</i>
What? <i>This is your fault.</i>
<i>This is what comes of your disrespect.</i>
I told you, Skyler.
I warned you for a solid year.
You cross me, there will be consequences.
What part of that didn't you understand?
You took my child.
<i>Because you need to learn.</i>
You bring her back.
Maybe now you'll listen. Maybe now you'll use your damn head.
You know, you never believed in me.
You were never grateful for anything I did for this family.
<i>"Oh, no. Walt. Walt, you have to stop.</i>
<i>You have to stop this. It's immoral. It's illegal.</i>
<i>Someone might get hurt."</i>
<i>You're always whining and complaining about how I make my money,</i>
<i>just dragging me down, while I do everything.</i>
<i>And now--</i>
Now you tell my son what I do,
<i>after I've told you and told you to keep your damn mouth shut.</i>
You stupid bitch.
<i>How dare you?</i>
I'm sorry.
You have no right
to discuss anything about what I do.
What the hell do you know about it anyway?
<i>Nothing. I built this.</i>
<i>Me. Me alone. Nobody else!</i>
You're right.
You're right.
You mark my words, Skyler.
Toe the line
or you will wind up just like Hank.
Walt.
Tell me what happened.
Where is Hank?
Please.
We need to know.
You're never gonna see Hank again.
<i>He crossed me.</i>
<i>You think about that.</i>
<i>Family or no.</i>
You let that sink in.
<i>Walt.</i>
<i>I just want Holly back.</i>
<i>Please, Walt.</i>
<i>Just come home.</i>
I've still got things left to do.
Hey.
ï»¿1
You can come on out.
It's an actual store. Mm-hm.
I guess I figured "vacuum cleaner repair" was a term of art.
If you would step right here on this blue spot.
Leave your luggage where it is for the moment.
That good?
Sure. What about this?
I'll Photoshop that out.
Oh, Nebraska. What's in Nebraska?
You. From now on.
It's gonna take me some time to get your new situation fixed.
Until then, you're gonna be staying here. I got a place downstairs, out of sight.
It's not the Ritz-Carlton, but it's comfortable enough for short-term.
How short-term?
Considering you got your face up on buses and billboards all over town,
I'm thinking, uh, two days.
Maybe three.
Only thing is,
and I don't like to do this,
but, uh, you'll have a bunk mate.
Oh, yeah? He's still here?
For the moment.
He's a special case. Gonna take some doing.
How's he holding up?
You be the judge.
We will find Hank.
Steve too.
They're out there, and we're gonna find them.
You have my word.
Sir.
Call it in, get her out of here. Move.
<i>I, uh, get to his door,</i>
<i>and I could hear music inside.</i>
<i>Like squeaky voices.</i>
<i>And I thought, you know, maybe, uh...</i>
<i>I knocked on his door.</i>
<i>The music stopped, and then he was right there.</i>
<i>When he saw the gun, he thought...</i>
Hey, Kenny.
Does this pussy cry through the entire thing?
Just watch.
<i>He kept saying that, you know, "You don't have to do this."</i>
<i>His eyes were so big.</i>
<i>They high-fived because it worked.</i> Such a bitch. He won't quit.
<i>Then, you know, we turn around</i>
<i>and there is this kid on a dirt bike</i>
<i>looking at us.</i>
<i>Drew Sharp.</i>
<i>That kid that went missing up in White Horse.</i>
<i>It's him.</i>
<i>And then out of nowhere,</i>
<i>Todd, that Opie, dead-eyed piece of shit,</i>
<i>pulls out a gun and shoots the kid.</i>
<i>This is Todd Alquist we're talking about?</i>
<i>He killed Drew Sharp?</i>
<i>Boom. Like it was nothing.</i>
Hey, Uncle Jack. Hold up.
We should keep him for a while, get a couple of cooks under our belt.
You seriously giving me this turn-the-other-cheek crap?
He ratted you out, personally. We still got 600 gallons of methylamine.
Meth? Who gives a shit about meth? We won the lottery here.
We've got all the money in the world. You're talking to me about selling crank?
I mean, this is millions, Uncle Jack.
No matter how much you got, how do you turn your back on more?
You little...
son of a bitch.
It's that Lydia woman.
You're sweet on her, you little bastard. Ha, ha, ha.
Hey, Kenny, you believe this? Hey, it's all about this right here, huh?
Come on.
You can do better.
That one's so uptight, probably got a wood chipper for a coochie.
Stick it in down there, you're pulling back a stump.
Oh, what the hell?
Heart wants what the heart wants, right?
Let's go back and watch some more of that crybaby rat, huh?
How thick is it?
This is mild steel?
Uh-huh.
No, this would be cash.
What?
Nothing.
Hey, you know what?
Make yourself useful.
Give me a list of hitters, mercenaries.
Yes, yes, I remember. You've got "concerns."
Don't worry. We'll take the time to vet them.
Make sure there are no undercover cops on the team.
Five should do it, providing they're the right men for the job.
I'm gonna hate myself for asking, but who are we hitting?
Jack Welker and his men.
They murdered Hank. They stole my life's work.
I don't know any hit men.
You know a guy who knows a guy.
Just get me the contacts. Anybody in that world.
I'm paying top dollar. We'll find them.
You mind if I give you a nickel's worth of advice?
Just for old time's sake?
You're worried about your wife and kids?
Don't leave.
The way things are now, some people-- Not me, mind you,
but some people might say you're leaving her high and dry.
Some people would be ignorant on the facts.
Some people wouldn't know that as far as the police are concerned,
Skyler is a blameless victim.
No, no, no. Go ahead.
Get it off your chest.
Go on.
The phone call was a smart move. Kudos to you.
Odds are it was recorded. It'll play great for a jury.
It might even buy her a mistrial.
In a year and a half. Until then, if they don't have you, they go after her.
There's no point. She knows nothing. Well, too bad. She's got nothing to trade.
I hate to be a downer here,
but there are two DEA agents missing, presumed dead.
Think the feds will let that go because you hit the ejector seat?
First thing they're gonna do, they will RICO your wife and kids out of the house.
That condo is gone.
Your bank accounts, they're frozen.
Her picture is probably on TV right now, next to yours. Who's gonna hire her?
Money is no problem. Well, I don't mean to contradict you,
but getting it to her, impossible.
The feds are praying that you'll make contact.
The Internet, the phone, it's all tapped.
Hey, Mike was no dummy.
But every time he tried to get his nest egg to his granddaughter,
it ended up in Uncle Sam's pockets.
So you propose what?
Stay. Face the music.
I mean, how much time have you got left? You walk in with your head held high,
be the John Dillinger of the Metropolitan Detention Center. How bad is that?
And you bring a barrel full of drug money.
Maybe that soothes some troubled waters.
Maybe they let your family stay in the house.
After all, the house predates the criminal enterprise.
God, you think I want to run?!
This is the last thing that I want.
This-- This changes nothing.
What I do, I do for my family.
My money goes to my children.
Not just this barrel. All of it!
I'm going to kill Jack and his entire crew,
and I'm gonna take back what is mine and give it to my children.
And then, and only then...
am I through.
Do you understand?
Everything good?
Define "good."
You're set. Time to go.
You'll be a little longer.
I'm still working on transportation.
Change of plans.
He's coming with me.
No. No, that's not-- We're going together. I can use him.
I'll give you two a minute.
Hey, I'm a civilian. I'm not your lawyer anymore.
I'm nobody's lawyer. The fun is over. From here on out, I'm Mr. Low-Profile.
A douche bag with a job and three pairs of Dockers.
If I'm lucky, month from now, best-case scenario,
I'm managing a Cinnabon in Omaha. You're still part of this,
whether you like it or not. Sorry. I don't think so.
You remember what I told you?
It's not over until--
It's over.
Do you want us to cuff her now? Would that make you feel better?
Your client admits to...
Her day of reckoning is now.
-by the time this goes to trial.
Is she even listening?
Mrs. White?
Are you following all this?
Do you understand what's happening here?
Yes.
I understand.
I understand I'm in terrible trouble.
I understand that you will use everything in your power
against me and my children unless--
Unless I give you Walt.
But the truth is, I can't give you what you want.
I don't know where he is.
All right, go and discuss this with your lawyer here.
Rack your brain.
And hope you can come up with something we can use.
<i>Four-seventeen?</i>
Four-seventeen. No activity.
Ma'am, is there anybody else in the house?
What about your son?
If I go look in his room, am I gonna see him?
He's not gonna pop out and surprise me?
If this guy takes his hand away, are you gonna scream?
He's at his friend's house.
He's been there all week.
Please, please, don't hurt my baby.
Please-- Please. Ma'am.
We got a lot of respect for your husband.
There's just something that we gotta straighten out.
Okay, we know that you've been talking to the police,
and that's okay. You gotta do that.
But you've seen some people.
Like that lady who came into the car wash.
The one with the black hair.
You said anything about her?
No.
You sure about that?
I didn't.
The police don't need to know anything about her.
Okay, ma'am, I'm gonna need you to say it.
I will not
say anything about her. Ever.
I swear.
Okay.
When we leave, you're not gonna go running to those police officers out front?
No.
Okay.
Okay.
Because you really don't want us coming back.
Uh-huh. Sure.
Don't. Stay where you are.
We'll talk like this.
Okay.
So that thing that we talked about, I went to Mr. and Mrs. White's house--
You don't have to say the name.
Sure. And it went really good.
I mean, the message was received loud and clear.
The message? Yeah.
Look, I know you did your best. I just think--
Hi. What can I get you?
Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.
And I'll need more stevia. Sure.
The person we're discussing saw my face.
You're not Western Union.
We can't just settle for you sending messages.
Really, if you'd been there, I think you'd see it different.
We threw a real scare into her.
She seems like a nice lady watching out for her kids.
So you're not going to have a problem with her.
I can pretty much guarantee it. I wish I had your certainty,
but I'm not like you and your uncle. I'm just-- I'm not used to this kind of risk.
We're gonna have to take a break.
I have 50 pounds vacuum-packed and ready to go.
And I wish you all the luck in the world with it.
It's 92 percent.
I'm sorry?
Ninety-two percent.
Truly? Tested it twice.
And it's blue, just like before.
Ninety-two. That's Heisenberg level.
He's not with you?
Well, next best thing. Pinkman.
They're looking for Pinkman.
Well, they're not going to find him. He's with us and he's not going anywhere.
Ms. Quayle, this is what your guys in Europe have been begging for, right?
I just think we work together good.
We make a good team.
I think it's kind of
mutually good.
Ninety-two percent.
Unh.
Unh.
Mr. Lambert, welcome to New Hampshire.
All right.
Let's have a look at this place.
You got about a month's worth of food on hand.
Most of it is canned goods, but there's steaks in the freezer.
You got a generator outside, works on LP.
Ought to be enough in the tank to last the winter.
It's only 15 amps, but that ought to do for the lights, the TV and the freezer.
That's a wood-burner.
Ought to warm the place up pretty good.
Plus you can cook on it.
On the TV front, the reception's pretty much nil.
You got some mountains in the way.
Weather is right, you might be able to catch Montreal,
but mostly you'll be limited to DVDs.
<i>Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.</i>
Two copies. Hm.
I'm not much of a movie guy.
I'll make a supply run next month.
You want something else to watch, put it on the list.
Supply run. Heh.
Fifty thousand dollars for a trip to Costco.
It's risk.
And risk is what you're paying me for, not toilet paper.
Risk and a 4400-mile round trip.
Mr. Lambert,
my clients and I don't usually have an ongoing relationship.
Normally you and I would have already gone our separate ways,
but you're you.
Where's the phone? No phone.
Up here, ice storms equal service calls, equal you in cuffs.
Internet? Same deal.
Also satellite, cable TV, drop phone, car.
You want news, I'll bring the Albuquerque papers.
Whatever you need, just put it on the list. Put it on the list. Yeah.
Look, I have business to conduct.
Your business is your business.
My business is keeping you out of custody.
You are the target of a nation-wide manhunt.
Your face is all over TV.
You are the hottest client I have ever had, by far.
It stands to reason you've got to keep out of sight.
And what's keeping me from walking out that gate?
Nothing.
There's a little one-horse town eight miles down the hill.
There's not a thing on God's green earth
that I can do to stop you going down there.
All I'm saying is...
if you leave this place, you will get caught.
And I gotta tell you,
if I find out that you've left the reservation,
I won't be coming back.
That is for my own safety. You understand?
Sure.
Know how to work the stove?
The flue can be tricky. Yeah, I got it.
You paid good money for this.
You got two acres up here, lots of woods, nice, warm place.
Seems to me just the spot for a man to rest up and think on things.
If you look around, it's kind of beautiful.
You've been very helpful. Thank you.
See you in a month.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Oh. Huh.
Come--
Oh, so you're just too good to eat with the rest of us, huh?
It's not for me.
Damn, man, seriously.
That's not my chocolate chip, is it?
You're gonna spoil him.
Hey, you awake?
Uh, yeah.
We had some Ben & Jerry's.
There's peanut butter cup and AmeriCone Dream.
I didn't know what you liked, so I got you some of each.
There you go.
So that batch that you just cooked was 96 percent.
Kind of figured you deserved a little something.
Thanks.
Well, better get some sleep.
Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.
Got a whole new batch.
Hey, Todd. Yeah?
Would you mind leaving the tarp off tonight?
Well, might get cold.
No, I don't mind. I just...
I just wanna see the stars.
Sure. Okay.
Thanks.
Well, good night, Jesse.
Night.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Okay.
Come on, bitch.
Go ahead! Do it!
Just kill me now and get it over with, because there's no way
I'm doing one more cook for you psycho fucks!
Yes? Hi, ma'am. How you doing tonight?
You're Andrea, right?
How can I help you?
You know Jesse Pinkman?
Right? Well, I'm a friend of his. My name's Todd.
I'm sorry to bother you so late, but it's nice to meet you.
How is Jesse? Is he okay?
Yeah, he's okay.
Actually, I brought him with me.
Jesse's here?
Yeah, he's right over there in that truck.
Where?
No!
Just so you know, this isn't personal.
No!
Whoa, hey, settle down.
Settle down.
Hey, remember.
There's still the kid.
I brought you a couple of cases of Ensure. Maybe put a little weight on you.
Jesus.
I can barely read this.
Ah. Almost forgot.
Without a prescription, I had to take an educated guess and shotgun it.
One of these ought to come close. Oh.
Did you check on them?
Is Skyler in a better place?
No, she's still at that place off of Eubank.
Kids are both still with her for the moment.
There's no court date yet.
The news was talking about a grand jury, but they didn't say when.
I saw her public defender on TV.
Looks like a deer in the headlights.
Think I got socks older than him.
What are they doing for money?
She's doing taxi dispatch, part-time.
Leaves the baby with a neighbor when she goes in.
I saw her shopping one time.
She looks pretty good.
And she's using her maiden name.
I wouldn't take that personally, under the circumstances.
Those working for you?
Yeah, yeah.
I took a run by your old house.
The auction's still pending.
They put a fence up around it.
They put up a fence?
Seems like the place got to be kind of a tourist attraction. Kids breaking in.
The neighbors complained, so the bank put up a fence.
You ready? Hm?
Yeah.
Sorry about last time.
It should go better now. I watched a couple of YouTube videos.
It's all about finding the vein.
Give it to me. I'll do it.
Here, you do it.
Make a fist. Tight. There we go.
All right, it's just...
Stick.
That's it. Okay. Hey.
Pretty good. There you go.
Think I had worse my last physical.
I will see you on...
Let's see.
Afternoon of the 15th.
Stay a little longer?
Yeah, I got a long trip ahead of me.
Two hours?
I'll give you another $10,000.
Please.
Ten thousand.
One hour.
Cards?
All right, well...
The game will be seven-card.
I'll deal, since you are encumbered.
One of these days, when you come up here,
I'll be dead.
My money over there.
What happens to it then?
What if I ask you to give it to my family?
Would you do it?
If I said yes...
would you believe me?
You wanna cut the cards?
No.
A king.
Two kings.
<i>Flynn White to the principal's office, please.</i>
I'm sorry to pull you out of class.
It's your aunt Marie.
It sounds very important.
You can take it in here, okay? Okay.
Here he is.
Thank you.
Hey, Aunt Marie.
What's--? What's going on?
Hold on a sec, honey.
<i>Look at those numbers for Denver.</i>
<i>Things haven't gone their way.</i>
Son, it's me. Please, don't let on.
<i>Carmen is nearby, right? She cannot know.</i>
<i>Son, are you there?</i>
Yes.
It's so good to hear your voice.
I, uh...
Son, the things that they're saying
<i>about me.</i>
<i>I did wrong. I made some terrible mistakes.</i>
But the reasons were always...
Things happened that I never intended.
I never intended--
Listen, son, we don't have much time.
Is Louis' family still at 4848 Newcombe?
<i>Son, your friend, Louis Corbett,</i>
<i>does his family still live in that same place up on Newcombe?</i>
Yes. <i>Okay, good.</i>
Okay, he's a good kid. He's like you. He'll understand.
<i>I'm sending Louis a package.</i>
<i>Now, it's addressed to Louis, but it's for you,</i>
<i>your mother and your sister.</i>
There's money inside.
About $100,000. Okay?
I think.
<i>It was all that I could fit into the box.</i>
<i>It has to be a secret.</i>
If anyone says a word, the police will take it.
<i>I wanted to give you so much more.</i>
<i>But this is all I could do.</i>
Do you understand?
Son?
Can you hear me? Do you understand?
You want to send money?
Yes. Good.
Good, good.
So you'll talk to Louis, right?
You killed Uncle Hank.
You killed him! Listen. Wait. Wait, son.
No. What you did to Mom-- You asshole. <i>Please--</i>
You killed Uncle Hank.
Listen to me. You've got to listen to me. Just shut up. Just stop it. Stop it.
<i>I don't want anything from you.</i>
I don't give a shit.
You need this money. <i>You killed Uncle Hank.</i>
<i>You killed him!</i> Your mother needs this money.
It can't all be for nothing. <i>What you did--</i>
Please. Please. <i>Just shut up. Shut up.</i>
<i>Will you just--? Just leave us alone.</i>
You asshole!
Why are you still alive?
<i>Why won't you just die already?</i> Please--
Just-- Just die.
<i>Wagner hasn't had to be really stellar tonight.</i>
<i>Made solid saves back in the first period.</i>
<i>You know, Michael, that's probably-- Going back, look at Wagner's numbers,</i>
<i>you know, it seems like he's one of the last goalies in the league.</i>
<i>They don't wanna put pressure on this guy.</i>
<i>Kevin Granato looks to make a move, had the puck taken.</i>
<i>Denver comes back out the other way.</i>
<i>--by Graham Melanson off Rycroft. Who else?</i>
<i>Boy, he's been all over the ice tonight.</i>
<i>DEA, Albuquerque District Office.</i>
<i>How may I direct your call?</i>
I'd like to speak to the agent
in charge of the Walter White investigation.
<i>Who may I say is calling?</i>
Walter White.
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>
<i>Sir? Sir, are you still there?</i>
<i>--this is notjust a goalie that's out there, it's a whole team.</i>
<i>Two forty-nine remaining in the third period.</i>
You ready for that drink now?
Dimple Pinch. Neat.
You got it.
<i>--and Melanson, with a good look, makes the save.</i>
<i>That's why you need good, solid breakout passes.</i>
<i>Matt Peterson-- Win the draw, Englehart wins the draw, back to Peterson,</i>
<i>goes behind the net, makes a terrible breakout pass, goes right to Hackard.</i>
<i>He just winds up, puts it on net here. Turnovers, turnovers.</i>
<i>When you get turnovers in the offensive zone, chances happen.</i>
<i>Hopefully it won't happen again.</i>
<i>Turnovers generally--</i>
<i>- I wasn't sure you'd come.
I'm not staying--</i>
<i>- Is this transfer good on the--?
Darker than a normal rosÃ©--</i>
<i>For us, it's always been science first, and--</i>
Wait, would you--? Would you--?
Would you go back, please?
<i>- ShamWows--
More of a by-product.</i>
There. <i>Exactly.</i>
What, this? Yes.
<i>Butjust yesterday, your charity,</i>
<i>the Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz Foundation,</i>
<i>announced a $28 million grant</i>
<i>for drug-abuse treatment centers throughout the Southwest.</i>
<i>Charlie, the Southwest is our home</i>
<i>and we couldn't just ignore what's going on in our own backyard.</i>
<i>But I'm sure you're aware that there are people who suggest other motives.</i>
<i>Andrew Ross Sorkin of</i> The New York Times
<i>wrote a column suggesting</i>
<i>that the grant was a kind of publicity maneuver</i>
<i>to shore up the stock price of Gray Matter Technologies</i>
<i>because of your association with Walter White.</i>
<i>That's not exactly the way--</i>
<i>To cleanse yourselves, so to speak,</i>
<i>of having a methamphetamine kingpin as cofounder of your company.</i>
<i>Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up.</i>
<i>I have to believe that the investing public understands</i>
<i>we're talking about a person who was there early on,</i>
<i>but who had nothing to do with the creation of the company</i>
<i>and still less to do with growing it.</i>
<i>So, what was Walter White's contribution?</i>
<i>You know, to be honest... Honey?</i>
<i>The company name. The company name.</i>
<i>We came up with it by combining our names.</i>
<i>"Schwartz" means "black."</i>
<i>Black plus white makes gray. Hence Gray Matter Technologies.</i>
<i>Exactly. As far as I can recall, his contribution begins and ends there.</i>
<i>There are continuing reports of blue methamphetamine,</i>
<i>considered his signature product, throughout the Southwest</i>
<i>and some evidence of reaching as far as Europe.</i>
<i>So my question is, is Walter White still out there?</i>
<i>No, he's not.</i>
<i>You sound very sure.</i>
<i>I am.</i>
<i>I can't speak to this Heisenberg that people refer to,</i>
<i>but whatever he became,</i>
<i>the sweet, kind, brilliant man</i>
<i>that we once knew long ago, he's gone.</i>
<i>But to be absolutely clear...</i>
Police! Hands! Show us your hands. Show us your hands.
What's going on?
Let's see your hands!
ï»¿1
Just get me home.
Just get me home.
I'll do the rest.
Yes, hello, this is David Linn from <i>The New York Times.</i>
May I speak with Susan, please? Thank you.
Hi, Susan, it's David again.
I was just calling to see if we can set--
Well, yes. Well, I figured we'd have to do the interview by phone,
since they've already left New York.
But what we'd really love to get is a photo of Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz
to go along with the article.
When are they scheduled to get home?
Oh, so they'll be home tonight. Gotcha.
Now, the address I have on them is Upper Canyon Road. Is that still...?
No, it isn't. They've-- Oh, let me get a pen.
Where do they...?
Tesuque. I see.
And the address?
Is that up near the opera house? I hear that's nice.
Well, I'll be in contact with my photographer
to check on his schedule.
No, no, it's their call.
I know how busy Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz are.
Thank you.
This should make one hell of a story.
Goodbye.
<i>I'm just saying, it's apples and oranges.</i>
Listen, I maintain,
if I want pizza,
I go to a pizza place. Yeah.
If I want Thai, I go to a Thai place.
What is the point in comparing Did I marry you?
pizza to Thai? What has happened?
This is different.
They're completely--
Oh, come on, are you the man I married?
I am the guy who wants to end this ridiculous conversation,
kick off my shoes, and have a very large glass of wine.
Well, I'm gonna tell you to be my guest.
All right, wait.
The answer is 21.
No. Yes.
Yes, because it has history.
Come on.
Prohibition.
The <i>Sweet Smell of Success.</i>
And Per Se has Thomas Keller.
Game, set, and match.
The whole vibe is so Yountville.
You transplant it to Manhattan--
Transplant it to Islamabad, I would eat there.
Oh, there's a good thought.
What, Islamabad?
No, Napa. We have to go to Napa.
Oh, my God, all this talk of food. Do you think Juana left us anything?
She doesn't think we're coming back until Wednesday.
Unless you told her. No, I haven't talked to her.
Oh, look, here.
Just a pear, that'll be perfect. Yeah.
You wanna get us a nice bottle of wine?
Mm-hm.
Do you think we have any of those--?
What are those crackers with, like, the sun-dried tomato,
and they were slightly peppery, but not too peppery.
We don't have them?
No.
Ask Juana.
We haven't had them in forever.
I don't know why she doesn't get those. Why don't you talk to her?
She's got that thing with her daughter.
Anyway, Napa? Yeah.
How long since we've been? Two years.
Jesus, that's two years.
Yeah, too long, right? Is this okay?
Oh, that looks <i>p e r fe c to.</i>
You wanna get the fireplace?
Is it good? Mm-hm.
Is it ripe? Mm-hm.
Yeah.
We could invite George and Delores. They could come up from Marin.
And Bill and Miriam Cohen.
We could have a little spa action, right?
And then we could do some sort of wine, and then--
Hello, Gretchen.
Elliott.
I really like your new house.
Walt.
This...
Are we looking east?
Oh...
My God, you must have one great view of the Sangre de Cristos.
Walt,
what are you doing here?
I saw you on <i>Charlie Rose.</i>
You looked great.
You both did. If you are here to--
To hurt us--
Walt, whatever it is you're planning--
Actually, I'm here to give you something.
It's out in my car.
How about the three of us take a walk to it? It's just parked down the road.
I couldn't get it past your gate.
Elliott, if we're gonna go that way,
you'll need a bigger knife.
Keep stacking. It'll all fit.
That's all right.
Yeah, just throw it on top.
Gretchen, would you mind? We don't want to lose any under the furniture.
All right.
That is $9,720,000.
Where did it come from? And why is it here?
I earned it, and you're going to give it to my children.
What? Why? Walt, I don't think we--
On my son's 18th birthday,
which is 10 months and two days from today,
you will give him this money,
in the form of an irrevocable trust.
You will tell him that it is his to do with as he sees fit,
but with the hope that he uses it for his college education.
And for the betterment of his family. Walt, I'm not sure that we follow.
Why...?
I mean, why, in particular, would we--?
If you wanna give your kids drug money, go do it yourself.
I can't.
My wife and son hate me.
They won't take my money.
Even if they did,
the federal government wouldn't let them.
But two rich benefactors who are known for their charitable endeavors,
who would think nothing of, for instance, writing a $28 million check,
to help victims of methamphetamine abuse?
I have to think that your money would be very welcome.
It wouldn't make any sense coming from us.
It certainly would.
My children are blameless victims of their monstrous father.
A man who you once knew quite well.
Call it a beau geste, call it liberal guilt,
call it whatever you want, but do it.
And you are not to spend a single dime of your own money.
If there are taxes or lawyers' fees owed, you will take it right from here.
They use my money, never yours.
Okay, Walt, sure.
That sounds reasonable.
So, what happens next?
I guess we shake on it, and I leave.
I can trust you to do this.
Yes.
Absolutely, you can.
Don't move. Don't-- Don't dare move a muscle.
You don't want them to think that you're trying to get away. Just breathe.
Just this afternoon, I had an extra $200,000
that I would have loved dearly to leave on top of this table.
Instead, I gave it to the two best hit men west of the Mississippi.
Now,
whatever happens to me tomorrow,
they'll still be out there.
Keeping tabs.
And if,
for any reason,
that my children do not get this money,
a kind of countdown will begin.
Maybe a day or so later, maybe a week, a year,
when you're going for a walk in Santa Fe or Manhattan or Prague, wherever,
and you're talking about your stock prices
without a worry in the world.
And then suddenly,
you'll hear the scrape of a footstep behind you,
but before you can even turn around:
Pop!
Darkness.
Cheer up, beautiful people.
This is where you get to make it right.
Oh, yeah, right.
You know, I don't exactly know how to feel about all this.
For real, yo.
Whole thing felt kind of shady, you know, like, morality-wise?
Totally.
How do you feel now?
Better. Yeah, definitely improving.
What's this I hear
about blue meth still being out there?
What do you mean?
Have you heard anything?
Is it still being sold?
Yeah.
By whom?
It's you, right?
I mean, aren't you still cooking?
Damn, man.
We were sure it was you,
because that shit is choice, yo.
Better than ever.
I mean, um, you know.
Jesse. Seriously?
You said he moved to Alaska. That's what I heard.
Right on, Jesse.
Passing the torch.
Damn, man, couldn't he at least throw a brother a bone?
Whoa, what happened there?
It's my birthday.
Yeah? Well, happy birthday.
It's easy money. Till we catch you. Say the word, I'll take you on a ride-along.
You can watch us knock down a meth lab.
Get a little excitement in your life. Heh, heh.
Yeah, someday.
Welcome. Would you like a menu? No, thank you.
Chamomile tea with soy milk, please. All right, you got it.
Hey, how you doing?
Good.
How's things?
Hey, I like your...
Shirt.
My blouse? Nice. Yeah, I like the color.
That's a nice color on you.
It's kind of a--
I don't know exactly what you'd call it. It's kind of a cornflower blue.
Before you say or do anything, just hear me out.
Todd. Nobody knows that I'm here.
Just listen for two minutes, and then I'll leave. Please.
No. Please.
Just two minutes of your time. That's all I ask.
Please.
You're running out of methylamine, aren't you?
I can do the math.
You've been at it long enough. You must be running low.
I have a new method
that requires no methylamine.
It's easy, and it will keep you in business. And, Todd, I could teach it to you.
How did you know to find us here?
Ten a.m.
Every Tuesday morning, you and I met here.
You're rather schedule-oriented, I guess.
Sorry.
I need the money.
I've spent almost all of mine already,
just trying to stay one step ahead of the police.
Mr. White, I don't think there's--
How much would it cost us?
Nothing short of a million.
And believe me, for this,
that is giving it away.
I think Jack should hear this.
Yeah, I don't know.
Now, listen, I can come up there tonight and talk to him.
He'd get it.
This is a win-win situation.
Hi, what can I get for you two? He's just leaving.
Good seeing you again. Take care.
For you?
I'm good.
And I need more stevia.
Okay, no disrespect to the man, but doing business with him?
Right now, that's not--
Of course we're not doing business with him.
Todd, please.
Don't make me walk you through this.
Jesus. Did you look at him?
You'd be doing him a favor.
<i>Hello, please record after the tone.</i>
<i>Truce, all right?</i>
<i>Skyler, I have news about Walt, and you need to hear it,</i>
<i>so if you're there, pick up.</i>
<i>Skyler--</i>
Hey.
What's up?
<i>Walt's in town.</i>
Yeah?
That car they thought he stole in New Hampshire,
they found it in a Denny's parking lot right on Central.
<i>And your next-door neighbor, on the right-- What's her name, Becky?</i>
Becky's on the left. Carol's on the right. <i>Becky, Carol, whatever.</i>
<i>She saw him at your old house.</i>
Just this morning, plain as day.
He's there, walking out of your house, and he calls her by name.
He didn't hurt her, did he? He didn't--? No, he's just like, "Hey, Becky!"
Or Carol, whatever.
<i>She said he looked exactly like the Unabomber.</i>
But she's positive it was him. They're getting calls from all over town.
He's here, he's there, he's going to blow up city hall.
He has some sort of manifesto. He wants to be on the news.
Who's making these calls? Him? <i>There are two or three voices.</i>
<i>They're not sure if they're crank calls or people he's put up to it,</i>
<i>or if they're actual anonymous tips.</i>
<i>It's stretching them thin, which is maybe the point.</i>
<i>As far as I'm concerned,</i>
there are three places that he would go: To you, to me, or Flynn.
<i>Right.</i>
They're watching the high school.
They're probably watching your place too.
I mean,
I know that's what Hank would do.
There is no way Walt's getting to you. They are absolutely going to catch him.
No doubt about it.
That arrogant asshole thinks he's some criminal mastermind, but he's not.
<i>But on the off chance...</i>
Yeah.
On the million-to-one chance,
you be on the lookout, okay?
Thanks.
You got it.
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
You didn't kill anybody sneaking in here, did you?
You didn't hurt anybody? No.
Didn't have to.
You look terrible.
Yeah.
But I feel good.
So talk.
Why are you here?
It's over.
And I needed a proper goodbye.
Not our last phone call.
So you're going to the police?
They'll be coming to me.
If you're in custody,
what stops those people from coming back?
When--
When I still had the house,
three men came in the middle of the night,
wearing masks, threatening Holly and Flynn and me.
They told me not to talk about that woman at the car wash,
and if you're in custody--
They're not coming back. Not after tonight.
What's tonight?
We don't want your money, Walt.
I thought Flynn made that clear.
He did.
And I don't have any to give you.
I spent the last of it getting here.
All I have to give you
is this.
Call the DEA once I leave.
Tell them I was here. That I forced my way in.
Tell them...
Tell them I wanted bacon and eggs on my birthday,
and that I gave you that ticket.
Those numbers are GPS coordinates.
For what?
A burial site.
That's where they'll find Hank and Steve Gomez.
It's where I buried our money.
And the men who stole it from us,
the men who still have it,
they murdered Hank and Steve
and put them in that hole.
Now, you trade that
for a deal with the prosecutor.
You get yourself out of this.
Skyler.
Skyler.
All the things that I did,
you need to understand-- If I have to hear
one more time
that you did this for the family--
I did it for me.
I liked it.
I was good at it.
And
I was
really...
I was alive.
Flynn will be home soon.
Before I go,
may I see her?
Whoo.
Damn, man, this thing's a classic.
What block you got in it?
The 500 or the 425?
Couldn't tell you.
Well...
Five hundred.
That's the one you want.
No replacement for displacement.
Where to?
To the clubhouse.
Go ahead, just park it right in front over here.
No, no, no, just straight in, man. Just-- What are--?
All right, fine, here, whatever.
Hey, how you doing?
Turn around, put your arms out like this.
While you're at it, why don't you lift your shirt up,
give us a spin?
Christ, I'm not wearing a wire.
Okay?
My wallet and keys? Yeah, you'll get them back. Just relax.
Stay here.
Keep your eyes open.
Jesus, look at you with that head of hair. Is that real?
Yes.
That's not a wig? Seriously? No.
What were you doing before, shaving it?
Yes.
Christ, that is one fine head of hair.
I mean, otherwise, you look like shit, but--
Hello to you too, Jack. Now, can we talk business?
I don't think so, no.
Did Todd tell you what I'm offering? Yeah, he told me.
The thing is we're not really in the market.
You're low on methylamine. What happens then?
No, we'll get more.
That Quayle woman's got her own setup. The heat's off her.
She can break loose a barrel. It ain't broke, so why fix it?
Todd, please, would you explain things to your uncle?
Explain to him the benefit of what I'm offering.
You really shouldn't have come back, Mr. White.
I'm sorry.
Wait. Jack. Where do you want it?
I don't know, anywhere but my living room?
Take him out back. Jack, look, you owe me.
You owe me. Hey, hey, hey.
Let's go. I owe you, what for?
Jesse Pinkman. You promised you would kill him, and you didn't.
Instead, you partnered with him. All right.
You're his partner now-- Whoa, stop.
Partners? What are you talking about?
He's alive, isn't he?
He's cooking for you.
What, are you gonna lie?
Him being alive is not him and me being partners.
Not by a damn sight.
What, you think I'd partner with a rat?
Where is that little piece of shit?
He's finishing up a batch.
Go get him. Bring him here.
Uncle Jack-- No. No, no, no.
This one here, calling me a liar?
He just insulted you, he insulted me, all of us.
Jesus. Hustle it up. Come on. Let's get this over with.
I'm gonna show you just how wrong you are.
Then I'm putting that bullet in your head myself.
Yeah, you see what I'm talking about, you son of a bitch?
Now, does this look like a partner to you?
Come here. Take a look.
Come here!
Take a look at him.
Have a gander.
This is my partner.
Right, partner? Right, buddy?
Hardworking, good partner. Fifty-fifty partner.
Can you hurry this shit up?
Make it quick?
Toddy, get him off, would you? Yeah, Toddy, get them both off.
Uncle Jack.
Jesus.
Mr. White.
Wait. Wait.
You want your money, right?
You wanna know where it is?
You pull that trigger, you'll never--
Do it.
You want this.
Say the words.
Say you want this!
Nothing happens until I hear you say it.
I want this.
Then do it yourself.
Pick up the phone.
<i>Hello?</i>
Is it done?
Is he gone?
<i>Yeah, it's done.</i>
<i>He's gone.</i>
<i>They're all gone.</i>
Todd? Who is this?
It's Walt.
How are you feeling?
Kind of under the weather?
Like you've got the flu?
That would be the ricin I gave you.
<i>I slipped it into that stevia crap that you're always putting in your tea.</i>
Oh, my God.
Well,
goodbye, Lydia.
