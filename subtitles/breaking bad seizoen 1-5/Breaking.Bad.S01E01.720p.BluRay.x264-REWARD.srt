1
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:12,780
Oh, my God. Christ!

2
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,661
Shit.

3
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,378
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

4
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,840
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Think, think, think.

5
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,511
Oh, my gosh.

6
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,210
Okay. Come on,
come on, come on.

7
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,212
Come on.

8
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,302
My name is
Walter Hartwell White.

9
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,222
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,

10
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,974
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

11
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,476
To all law-enforcement entities,

12
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,020
this is not an admission
of guilt.

13
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,649
I am speaking to my family now.

14
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,907
Skyler.

15
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,243
You are the love of my life.

16
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,370
I hope you know that.

17
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,915
Walter Jr.

18
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,334
You're my big man.

19
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:53,089
There are... There are going
to be some things...

20
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,925
Things that you'll
come to learn about me

21
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,802
in the next few days.

22
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,307
I just want you to know
that no matter how it may look

23
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,269
I only had you in my heart.

24
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,485
Goodbye.

25
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,898
Money before the panel earlier this year.

26
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,566
Happy birthday.

27
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,902
Oh.

28
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,320
Look at that.

29
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,657
That is veggie bacon.

30
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,575
Believe it or not.
Zero cholesterol

31
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,661
and you won't even
taste the difference.

32
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,079
Mm.

33
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,747
What time do you think
you'll be home?

34
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:32,957
Same time.

35
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,584
I don't want him
dicking you around tonight.

36
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,422
You get paid till 5,
you work till 5. No later.

37
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,965
Aha.

38
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,259
Hey.

39
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,511
Hey, happy birthday.
Well, thank you.

40
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,596
You're late again.

41
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,349
There was no hot water again.

42
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,393
I have an
easy fix for that.

43
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,894
You wake up early,

44
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,148
and then you get to be the first
person in the shower. Hm.

45
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,025
I have an idea.

46
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,447
How about buy
a new hot-water heater?

47
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:09,201
How's that idea?
For the million-billionth time.

48
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,164
Did you take your echinacea?

49
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,373
Yeah.

50
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,459
I think it's getting better.

51
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,128
What the hell is this?

52
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,504
Hey.
It's veggie bacon.

53
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,632
We're watching our cholesterol,
I guess.

54
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,470
Not me. I want real bacon.
Not this fake crap.

55
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,305
Too bad. Eat it.

56
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,975
Phew.
This smells like Band-Aids.

57
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,019
Eat it.

58
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,359
So how does it feel to be old?

59
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,320
How does it feel
to be a smart-ass?

60
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,989
Heh. Good.

61
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,242
Eat your veggie bacon.

62
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,930
You're all set?
Yeah, I'm fine.

63
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,432
All right, see you at home.
Okay, see you.

64
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,438
Chemistry.

65
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,399
It is the study of what?

66
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,152
Anyone?

67
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,906
Ben.
Chemicals.

68
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,866
Chemicals.

69
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,452
No.

70
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,080
Chemistry is...

71
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:41,460
Well, technically, chemistry
is the study of matter.

72
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,755
But I prefer to see it
as the study of change.

73
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,550
Now, just...
Just think about this.

74
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,301
Electrons.

75
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,554
They

76
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,222
change their energy levels.

77
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,266
Molecules.

78
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,686
Molecules change their bonds.

79
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:03,607
Elements. They combine
and change into compounds.

80
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,443
Well, that's...
That's all of life, right?

81
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,238
I mean, it's just...
It's the constant, it's the cycle.

82
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:14,243
It's solution, dissolution,
just over and over and over.

83
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,829
It is growth, then decay,

84
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,373
then transformation.

85
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,254
It is fascinating, really.

86
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,760
Chad.

87
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,098
Is there something wrong
with your table?

88
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,477
Okay, ionic bonds.

89
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,656
Are you done?

90
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,495
Ionic bonds. Chapter six.

91
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,343
One, two, three makes 10,
and 10 makes 20.

92
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,719
There's your receipt.

93
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,305
Just hand this claiming disc
to your car-wash professional.

94
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,266
Thank you. Come again.

95
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,656
He's not coming.
He says he quits.

96
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,407
I'm gonna run the register.

97
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,327
Bogdan, no.
We talked about this.

98
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,080
I'm short-handed, Walter.
What am I to do?

99
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,001
Walter?

100
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,879
What am I to do?

101
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,027
Hey, Mr. White.

102
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,904
Make those tires shine, huh?

103
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,031
Oh, my God.

104
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,784
You will not believe
who's cleaning Chad's car.

105
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,828
Mr. White.

106
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,288
From chemistry.

107
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,560
Surprise!

108
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,145
Happy birthday, Dad.

109
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,564
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

110
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,485
Oh, you're so very late.

111
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,321
Really, I'm serious, Skyler.

112
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,614
I mean, you're flat
as a washboard.

113
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,326
Oh.
You look awesome.

114
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,369
She's not showing at all,
is she?

115
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,413
She's showing a little.

116
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,250
Carmen, this is my sister,
Marie.

117
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,502
Nice to meet you.
Hi.

118
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,631
Glock 22,
that's my daily carry, okay?

119
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,634
I mean, unless you're talking,
what, Plus P Plus loads,

120
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,428
you can forget the 9 mil,
all right?

121
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,431
Shit, I seen one of those bounce
off a windshield one time.

122
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,932
Yeah, with you shooting.
Hey.

123
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,602
If you're gonna bring a gun,
baby,

124
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,145
you gotta bring enough gun.

125
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,355
Forty caliber.

126
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,939
Uh...

127
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,691
This is awesome.
Nice, isn't it?

128
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,652
Yeah. Dad,
come check this out.

129
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,862
Yeah, I see it.

130
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,448
- Come on, take it.
- Yeah. Check it out, Walt.

131
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,200
Ooh.

132
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,077
No, no, it's just heavy.

133
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,453
That's why they hire men.

134
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,040
Hey, it's not gonna bite you.

135
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,918
Looks like Keith Richards with a
glass of warm milk, doesn't he?

136
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,798
Hey, Walt. Everybody, listen
up, listen up, listen up.

137
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,007
I'm gonna give a toast,

138
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,760
a little toast to my brother-in-law.
Come here.

139
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:04,139
Walt, you got a brain
the size of Wisconsin

140
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,058
but we're not gonna hold that
against you.

141
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,436
But your heart's
in the right place, man.

142
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,147
Your heart's in the right place.
We love you, man. We love you.

143
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,857
Everybody, to Walt.

144
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,157
Oh, shit. Turn on channel three.

145
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,828
At which point, we
apprehended three individuals

146
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,955
and placed them into custody.

147
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,666
I'm proud to say
the outstanding professionalism

148
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:34,169
of my fellow agents at the
Albuquerque District Office

149
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,005
resulted in a substantial
amount of methamphetamine

150
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,674
being taken off the streets.

151
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,634
- Were any shots fired?
- No, ma'am.

152
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,469
Our agents took the suspects
by surprise.

153
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,556
Damn. The TV does add 10 pounds.

154
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,057
Ten pounds?

155
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,852
Hey, sit and spin, both of you.

156
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,521
Hank.
What?

157
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,982
Sorry. You didn't see that.

158
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,650
So charming.

159
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:00,362
- Clearly an ongoing operation.
One which was well-organized...

160
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,948
- Hank, how much money is that?
- It's about 700 grand.

161
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,533
It was a pretty good haul.

162
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,785
As I say, it's a good day
for the citizens of Albuquerque

163
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,203
Wow.

164
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,081
When we can put this big a dent
in the local drug trade.

165
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,334
Well, that's unusual, isn't it?
That kind of cash?

166
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,420
Mm. Well, it's not the most
we ever took.

167
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,881
It's easy money,
till we catch you.

168
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,382
Heh-heh.

169
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,885
Walt, just say the word and
I'll take you on a ride-along.

170
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,220
You can watch us knock
down a meth lab, huh?

171
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,890
Get a little excitement
in your life.

172
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,809
Yeah, someday.

173
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,320
Which one's this?

174
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,573
Um, that faux-Lalique vase
I picked up at the Super-Swap.

175
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,325
Oh.

176
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,788
How's it doing?

177
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,250
Well, I met my reserve
and there's still two minutes.

178
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,377
Oh.

179
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,968
What's up?

180
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,429
You tell me, birthday boy.

181
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,226
Oh, hey, so, what's up
for Saturday?

182
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,355
Mm. Car wash.
Bogdan says he needs me.

183
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,023
Till what time?
Noon, 1 -ish?

184
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,859
Probably 2, more like it.

185
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,946
And then what after that?

186
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,282
Um, actually,

187
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,285
ahem, I was thinking of
driving up to Los Alamos.

188
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,870
They've got this...

189
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,455
The visitor center
has an exhibit on

190
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,958
that's really supposed to be...

191
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,294
You're not gonna paint?
No, I'll paint.

192
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,964
It's just that this...

193
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,590
You know, this exhibition

194
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,719
on the Mars-rover
photographs are...

195
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,139
I mean, the detail really is
just supposed to be amazing.

196
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,976
It's just that I really need you
to paint at some point.

197
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,103
The sooner that back bedroom
gets finished...

198
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,521
I know.

199
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,816
And I'd do it myself, except you said you
don't want me standing on the stepladder.

200
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,318
I will paint.
Okay.

201
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,324
What is going on down there?
No, it's...

202
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,118
Is he asleep?

203
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,703
No, it's...

204
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,497
No, it's nothing. He's just...

205
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,834
You know. Well, you gotta be
careful about the baby and...

206
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,254
Well, don't worry about
the baby. This is just for you.

207
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,717
We are just doing you tonight.

208
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,928
So just close your eyes,

209
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,723
relax, and let it...

210
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,353
Close your eyes.
Oh, okay.

211
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,230
Okay.

212
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,692
There you go.

213
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,030
That's it.

214
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,866
There you go.

215
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:58,874
Keep it going.

216
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:03,795
Keep... Yes! Fifty-six. Oh.

217
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,391
This is so embarrassing.
I am fine, honestly.

218
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,935
It's just some bug going around.

219
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,521
First, my wife had it,
then my son, and now me.

220
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:06,942
It's just...
It's just like a chest cold.

221
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,568
Could be some low
blood sugar as well.

222
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,821
I didn't have the greatest
breakfast this morning.

223
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,489
Honestly, I didn't.

224
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,617
Hey, listen, can you do me
a favor? Can you just, uh,

225
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,869
drop me off at a corner
somewhere?

226
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,164
Uh, no, sorry.

227
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,292
It's just that I don't have
the greatest insurance.

228
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,336
Take a couple of deep breaths
for me.

229
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,137
Is there anybody
you want us to contact for you?

230
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,556
Ha. No. God, no.

231
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,975
Lean forward for me,
would you?

232
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,604
Mr. White, are you a smoker?

233
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,357
No, never.

234
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,485
Why do you ask?

235
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,694
Mr. White?

236
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,696
Mr. White?

237
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,199
Yes?

238
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,494
You understood
what I've just said to you?

239
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,704
Yes.

240
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,624
Lung cancer. Inoperable.

241
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm sorry.
I just need to make sure

242
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,881
you fully understand.

243
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,550
Best-case scenario, with chemo,

244
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,970
I'll live maybe another
couple years.

245
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,432
It's just

246
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,310
you've got mustard on your...

247
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,773
Right there.
You got mustard there.

248
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,483
Right there.

249
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,577
So my records show
that I paid it

250
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,789
and I certainly don't feel
that we owe any late...

251
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,582
Yeah, all right. Um...

252
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,127
Well, I'll check with the bank
and maybe the post office

253
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,588
if they lost it or something.

254
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,800
Yeah, let me look into that.
Okay.

255
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,176
Thank you.

256
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,516
Hey.

257
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,935
Um,

258
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,729
did you use the MasterCard
last month?

259
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,608
Uh,
fifteen eighty-eight at Staples?

260
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,575
Um... Oh, we needed
printer paper.

261
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,745
Walt, the MasterCard's
the one we don't use.

262
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,206
Okay.

263
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,376
So how was your day?

264
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,379
Oh, you know.

265
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,632
I don't know. It was, um,

266
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,636
fine.

267
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,207
Hey, Walter.

268
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,834
Walter.

269
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,086
Walter. Tomorrow night
I'm shorthanded.

270
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,796
I need you outside
to do wipe downs.

271
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,089
Come on.
What?

272
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,258
I said I need you outside
to do some wipe downs.

273
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,719
Are you here to work,
or to be staring at the skies?

274
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,763
Come on. Let's go.

275
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,183
Come on, man.

276
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,851
Fuck you, Bogdan.

277
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,102
What?

278
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,897
I said, "fuck you."
And your eyebrows.

279
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,445
Wipe down this!

280
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,589
Yo.

281
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:25,051
Uh, Hank?
Hank, it's Walt. Hey.

282
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,762
Oh, listen. I didn't wake you,
did I?

283
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,265
Oh, good, good.

284
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:34,060
Oh, no, no.
Nothing's wrong. I just...

285
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,896
I've been, uh, thinking about
that offer

286
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,233
of that ride-along.

287
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,902
It's the last house
on the right. See it?

288
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,988
Not the two-story one,
the one next to it.

289
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,657
Kind of, uh, I don't know
what do you call that? Um,

290
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:48,867
green?

291
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,202
Sage.

292
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,662
"Sage?"

293
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,123
Do you work at the fucking
Pottery Barn? Jesus.

294
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,500
Sage.
That's the word for it.

295
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,628
My fault the only word your
dumb ass knows is "green"?

296
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,340
"Cheese-dick." I know that one.
How about that?

297
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,968
Anyway, it's the, um,
sage one. See it?

298
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,512
So, what tells
you it's a meth lab?

299
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,722
Just our snitch.

300
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,975
Says some dude who
goes by "Cap'n Cook"

301
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,810
lives up to his name in there.

302
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:20,023
Says he always adds a dash
of chili powder. Heh-heh.

303
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,442
Ah, you exuberant Mexicans.

304
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,528
Uh-uh. "Cap'n Cook?"
That's a white boy's name.

305
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,821
Dopey as hell too.

306
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,990
Yeah? I'll tell you what.

307
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,326
I got you 20 bucks
that says he's a beaner.

308
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,329
All right.
You're on.

309
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,583
All right. Come on,
come on, come on.

310
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,714
All right. School bus is clear.
You got the green light.

311
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,466
Copy that.

312
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,725
Watch this. Makes them shit.

313
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,523
Go, go, go, go!

314
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,910
Meth labs are
nasty on a good day.

315
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,371
You mix that shit wrong
and you got mustard gas.

316
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,207
Phosphine gas.

317
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,584
I think.
Yeah, exactly.

318
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,379
One whiff will kill you.
That's why the respirators.

319
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:15,013
House is clear.
One suspect in custody.

320
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,599
Copy that.
The suspect,

321
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,934
might he be of
the Latino persuasion?

322
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,937
Driver's license
says "Emilio Koyama."

323
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,772
Asian. Pay up, sucker.

324
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,609
Hey, hey. First name, Emilio.

325
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,444
That's at least half a beaner.

326
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,571
Tell you what,
I'll let you off for a 10.

327
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,781
Whoa. Heh, heh.

328
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,116
Cheer up, Gomey.

329
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,535
You people still got J. Lo.
Hank.

330
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,622
Do you think I might
get to go inside?

331
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,749
See the actual lab?

332
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,793
Uh,

333
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,128
yeah.

334
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,881
Yeah, I'll tell you what, we're
gonna go peek our heads in

335
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,050
check it out first.

336
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,928
Stay here a minute.
Let's go, Frank.

337
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,324
Oh, God.

338
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,917
Oh, God.

339
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,759
Oh, my God.

340
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:37,679
Pinkman?

341
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:38,031
Hey. Uh, it's me.
I'm alone.

342
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:45,913
How'd you find me?

343
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,916
You're still
in our filing system.

344
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:55,256
So your... Your aunt
owns this place, right?

345
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,674
I own it.

346
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,804
Look, no one's looking for you.

347
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,098
Why are you here?

348
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,184
I was curious.

349
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:09,937
Honestly, I never expected
you to amount to much...

350
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,231
but methamphetamine?

351
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,649
L...

352
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,902
I didn't picture that.

353
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,863
There's a lot of money in it,
huh?

354
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,823
I don't know what you're
talking about.

355
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,825
No?
Not a clue.

356
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,954
Cap'n Cook?

357
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,956
That's not you?

358
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,298
Like I said,
no one is looking for you.

359
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,550
Look, I don't know what
you think you're doing here,

360
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,135
Mr. White.

361
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,513
I mean, if you're planning
on giving me some

362
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,141
bull-winder about getting right
with Jesus or turning myself in.

363
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,186
Not really.
High school was a long time ago.

364
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:54,857
You ain't Welcome Back, Kotter,
so step off. No speeches.

365
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,984
Short speech.

366
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,405
You lost your partner today.
What's-his-name.

367
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:04,325
Emilio?

368
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,661
Emilio is going to prison.

369
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:11,791
The DEA took all
your money, your lab.

370
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,669
You've got nothing.

371
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:17,046
Square one.

372
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,340
But you know the business

373
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,677
and I know the chemistry.

374
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,015
I'm thinking

375
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,393
maybe you and I
could partner up.

376
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:45,533
You, uh...
You wanna cook crystal meth?

377
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,119
You.

378
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,789
You and, uh...
And me.

379
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,541
That's right.

380
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,085
Wow.

381
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,045
Either that,

382
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,715
or I turn you in.

383
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,351
What the hell is this?

384
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,561
Damned if I know.

385
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,897
I described it
as mosaic folk art.

386
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,273
And somebody bought it?

387
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,733
Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis.

388
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,319
Fourteen dollars plus shipping.
Yes.

389
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,572
At this rate, in 50 or
60 years you'll be rich.

390
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,116
So how goes the novel?

391
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,744
It's not a novel, actually,
which I...

392
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,454
You're not writing a novel?

393
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,748
You told me you were.
No. Short stories.

394
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,459
I said that if eventually
I have enough good ones,

395
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:38,377
that maybe I'll try

396
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,130
and publish another collection.

397
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,841
Those really didn't sell.

398
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,929
I just thought a novel
would be easier to sell.

399
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,140
Yeah, well, maybe so.

400
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,101
Ever want me to read anything,
I could critique it for you.

401
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,354
Oh.

402
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:57,980
No.

403
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:03,861
I mean, I'm just not
at that stage where I...

404
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,071
No.

405
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:08,658
Open offer.

406
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,326
So, what's up with Walt lately?

407
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,370
What do you mean?
He's fine.

408
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,455
He just seems,

409
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,541
I don't know.
Quieter than usual.

410
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,293
Well, turning 50 is a big deal.

411
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:23,172
I mean, I'm sure as hell
not looking forward to 40.

412
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,968
You're gonna be a
complete basket-case.

413
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,473
So it's a mid-life crisis.

414
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,976
No. He's just quiet.

415
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:36,894
How's the sex?

416
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,105
Marie, Jesus.

417
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:40,982
I guess that answers that.

418
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,026
You just gonna sit there?

419
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,745
Look at this. Look at this.

420
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:40,583
Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 milliliters. Very rare.

421
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,544
You got your usual
paraphernalia, Griffin beakers,

422
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:47,673
there's your Erlenmeyer flask.
Butthe pièce de résistance,

423
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:53,054
a round bottom boiling flask,
5000 milliliters. Huh?

424
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,392
I cook in one of those.
A big one.

425
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,854
One of these?

426
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,564
No, this is a
volumetric flask.

427
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,232
You wouldn't cook
in one of these.

428
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,817
Uh, yeah. I do.

429
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,444
Uh, no, you don't.

430
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:12,490
A volumetric flask is for
general mixing and titration.

431
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,493
You wouldn't apply heat
to a volumetric flask.

432
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,578
That's what a boiling flask
is for.

433
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,081
Did you learn nothing
from my chemistry class?

434
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,334
No. You flunked me, remember?

435
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,795
No wonder.
Prick.

436
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,465
And let me tell you something else.
This ain't chemistry.

437
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,634
Okay, this is art.
Oh, ha.

438
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,427
Cooking is art,

439
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,722
and shit I cook is the bomb,
so don't be telling me.

440
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,350
Shit you cook is shit.
The shit.

441
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,602
I saw your setup. Ridiculous.

442
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,438
You and I will not
make garbage.

443
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,358
We will produce a chemically
pure and stable product

444
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,777
that performs as advertised.
No adulterants.

445
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,487
No baby formula.
No chili powder.

446
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,781
No, no. Chili P's my signature.

447
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,282
Not anymore.

448
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,370
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

449
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,621
What the hell is this?

450
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,456
Lab safety equipment.

451
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,751
We're also gonna have
an emergency eye wash station.

452
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,546
These chemicals and
their fumes are toxic.

453
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,381
In case you didn't know that.

454
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,843
Well, you can dress up like
a faggot if you want. Not me.

455
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,642
Listen, this stuff

456
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,061
doesn't stay more than a day.

457
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,938
What? I thought we
were gonna cook here.

458
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,481
No, we're not
gonna cook here.

459
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,651
Okay, this is my house.
I don't shit where I eat.

460
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,403
Well, then where
are we gonna work?

461
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,322
You tell me.
This is your deal, man.

462
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,491
You wanna smoke it up,
smoke it up at your house.

463
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:41,996
No, I didn't think so.
Oh, well.

464
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,499
Well,

465
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:49,003
what if we rented one of those
self-storage places?

466
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:52,006
You know, those little orange garages?
Worked out of there?

467
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:56,093
No, they're onto that. They've
got dogs that sniff around.

468
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,723
RV, that's what you want.

469
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,350
What, like a Winnebago?

470
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,104
Yeah.

471
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,192
I know a dude
who wants to sell his.

472
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,444
He just goes camping with it.

473
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,030
But a mobile meth lab?
That'd be the bomb.

474
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:20,034
I mean, you can drive
way out in the boonies.

475
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:21,744
Be all evasive.

476
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:51,357
Dude, this isn't even
seven grand, all right?

477
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:52,733
My guy wants 85.

478
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,903
This is all the money
I have in the world.

479
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,489
You're a drug dealer. Negotiate.

480
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,576
You are not how I
remember you from class.

481
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,203
I mean, like, not at all.

482
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,538
Yeah, well, I gotta go.

483
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,747
Wait. Wait. Hold up.

484
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:11,836
Tell me why you're doing this.
Seriously.

485
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,671
Why do you do it?

486
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,298
Money, mainly.

487
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,551
There you go.

488
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,512
Nah, come on, man.

489
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,056
Some straight like you,
giant stick up his ass

490
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:27,685
all a sudden at age, what, 60,
he's just gonna break bad?

491
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,271
I'm 50.
It's weird, is all.

492
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,606
Okay, it doesn't compute.
Listen,

493
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,442
if you've gone crazy
or something,

494
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,446
I mean, if y... If you've gone
crazy, or depressed.

495
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,532
I'm... I'm just saying.

496
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,702
T... That's something
I need to know about.

497
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,162
Okay, I mean, that affects me.

498
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,879
I am awake.

499
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,050
What?

500
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,180
Buy the RV.

501
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,101
We start tomorrow.

502
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,817
How's it coming in there?

503
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,986
Fine.

504
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,620
Do you want me or your dad?

505
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,582
Dad.

506
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:50,225
So how are those feeling in the waist?
Are they too tight?

507
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,686
You don't want to get them
if they're too tight.

508
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:56,106
They're...
They're pretty shrunk.

509
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,984
Are you sure you don't want to get the...?
Like a different kind?

510
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,903
Like, you know,
the skinny jeans,

511
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,614
because those are in style.
The skaters wear them.

512
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,283
Do I look like a skater?

513
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,493
All right.

514
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:10,704
Mom, get them, my big boy pants.

515
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:15,125
Mommy, could you zip up
my big boy pants?

516
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,259
- Don't.
- What?

517
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,053
Don't.

518
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,513
Walt.

519
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,101
Where...?
I have no idea.

520
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,729
No, you know what?
Don't even look at them.

521
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,899
They're obviously very stupid.
Yep.

522
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,234
Yeah.

523
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,406
I think that, um... I think those
jeans look really good on you.

524
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,409
I think you should get them
if you like them, okay?

525
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,203
You know what? Why don't you hang out
here for a second. I'll be right back.

526
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,705
Fine.

527
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,957
Hey, Mommy,
I think I pinched a loaf

528
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,710
in my brand new big boy pants.

529
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,176
What are you doing?

530
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,179
What's wrong, chief?
Having a little trouble walking?

531
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,265
Get off me! Get off me!

532
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,103
I'll mess you up, man.

533
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,772
You'll have one shot.
You'd better make it good.

534
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,275
What, are you waiting for
your girlfriends? You better go.

535
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:24,486
You'd better go. Take it.
Take your shot. Take it!

536
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:28,198
Come on. Come on.

537
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,909
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's go.

538
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:34,038
Psycho.

539
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,201
Yeah, nothing but cows.

540
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,704
Got some big cow house way out
that way, like two miles,

541
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,499
but I don't see nobody.

542
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,167
"Cow house"?

543
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,170
Yeah. Where they live.

544
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,713
The cows.

545
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:30,177
Whatever, man.
Shit, yeah. Let's cook here.

546
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,181
Cow house.

547
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,724
God help me.

548
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,196
Uh, what are you doing?

549
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:52,449
These are my good clothes.

550
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,827
You can't go home
smelling like a meth lab.

551
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,871
Uh, yeah, you can. I do.

552
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,748
Those?

553
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:03,710
Wow. Those, uh... You're
keeping those on, right?

554
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,513
Come on. Daylight's burning.

555
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,640
Oh, my God.

556
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:27,401
Wow, this is... This
is a good look for you.

557
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,904
I mean, you're maybe only
the world's second-biggest homo.

558
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,740
Would you shut up and help me?

559
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,243
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

560
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,996
Work it. Baby, work it.

561
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:40,998
Turn that off.

562
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,484
This is glass-grade.

563
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:51,985
You got...

564
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:56,031
Jesus, you got crystals in here
two inches, three inches long.

565
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,908
This is pure glass.

566
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:02,162
You're a goddamn artist.

567
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,123
This... This is art, Mr. White.

568
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,668
Well, actually,
it's just basic chemistry,

569
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,671
but thank you, Jesse.
I'm glad it's acceptable.

570
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,674
Acceptable?
You're the goddamn Iron Chef.

571
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,593
Every jibhead from here to
Timbuktu's gonna want a taste.

572
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,888
Man, I... I gotta try this.

573
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:23,350
No. No.

574
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,019
No. We only sell it.
We don't use it.

575
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,523
Okay, since when?

576
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:32,192
Listen, you've been watching
way too much Miami Vice.

577
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,694
That ain't happening.

578
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,575
So, what now?

579
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,704
How do we proceed?

580
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,836
We cook more tomorrow.

581
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:53,088
Meantime,

582
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,674
I know just the guy to talk to.

583
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,845
Get him. Come on.

584
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:08,145
Hey, yo. Kraze,
how you doing, my man?

585
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:14,526
Hey, you got a new dog.
Right on, man.

586
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,653
What's his name?

587
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,573
Yeah, I had a dog like that
once,

588
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,742
except maybe like twice as big.

589
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,577
Super-purebred.

590
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,037
Now, me personally,

591
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,372
I would train him to go
straight for the nutsack.

592
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,583
Just shut your mouth
and show me your money.

593
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,251
I ain't buying, ese.

594
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,087
I'm selling.

595
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,600
Tell me that ain't the finest
scante you ever laid eyes on.

596
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,936
Go ahead. Try it.

597
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,273
Hey, poochie. How you doing?

598
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,567
Jesus Christ.

599
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:59,071
Yeah. Booya! See, what'd I say?

600
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,698
It's all right.
It's all right?

601
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,617
It's all right?
Yeah, it's all right.

602
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,243
So what?
You're back in business?

603
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,079
Hell, yeah, I'm back.

604
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:10,791
With a vengeance.
Vato loco gotta make a living.

605
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,794
You know, with your cousin
gone away and all...

606
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,297
And listen, homes,
about that...

607
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,802
Really broke me up about Emilio.

608
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,137
That dude is like my brother.

609
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,931
You okay? You talk to him?

610
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,265
Yeah, I talk to him.

611
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,642
Said when the feds came,

612
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,478
you were out sticking it in
some neighbor lady.

613
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,814
Hey, you know,
I got lucky twice.

614
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,857
I don't know, man.

615
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:37,067
Emilio...

616
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,406
he thinks maybe
you dimed on him.

617
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,660
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
That is bullshit.

618
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:48,954
That is bullshit, Krazy-8.

619
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:51,748
I should kick his punk ass
for even thinking that.

620
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,000
You know what?
Next time you talk to Emilio,

621
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,753
you tell him for me, all right?

622
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,885
Why don't you tell him yourself?
Made bail this morning.

623
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,846
Go ahead, pendejo.

624
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,014
Kick my ass.
Hey, listen...

625
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:13,979
Where did you get this?

626
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:15,522
Hm?

627
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,025
Because I know your little
punk ass didn't cook it.

628
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:51,892
Damn, man. What are you,
some kind of nudist?

629
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:57,147
Yeah, that's some stone-fine tick-tick
you been cooking there, ese.

630
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,982
How about you come
work for me?

631
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,737
I'd be willing to sell it to you

632
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:05,280
if... If the price is right.

633
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,418
Out here all by yourself, huh?

634
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:30,055
Hey, I know you. He was
there when I got busted.

635
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:32,265
He's with the DEA.
No.

636
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:35,602
You rata snitch motherfucker.

637
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,312
Run, Mr. White! Run!

638
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:40,524
Ah.

639
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,199
I say we cap them both.

640
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,667
You really cook up that batch?

641
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,419
Yeah.

642
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,463
You an artist.

643
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,633
It's a damn shame.
Wait.

644
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,970
Wait a minute.

645
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:14,808
Listen to me.
I'll teach you my recipe, huh?

646
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:17,143
What do you say?
You wanna cook like me?

647
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,440
You let us both live,

648
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:27,404
and I will teach you, huh?

649
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,019
Put the cigarette out.

650
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,064
Please...

651
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,111
Move it, homes. You got all day?

652
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,990
Okay.

653
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:14,631
Shit.

654
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,470
Shit!

655
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,951
What happened?

656
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:12,332
Hey, what'd you do to them?

657
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,877
Red phosphorus in the
presence of moisture

658
00:54:16,045 --> 00:54:17,962
and accelerated by heat

659
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,423
yields phosphorus hydride.

660
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:23,718
Phosphine gas.

661
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:27,764
One good whiff and poof.

662
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,288
We gotta...

663
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,710
We gotta clean this up.

664
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,634
Where were you?

665
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,602
Walt...

666
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,774
I don't know what's
been going on with you lately

667
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,694
but...
Nothing, honey. I'm fine.

668
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:09,490
Whatever it is,
I'll tell you this.

669
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:12,869
I do not like it
when you don't talk to me.

670
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:17,248
The worst thing you can do
is shut me out.

671
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:05,004
Walt...

672
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:10,885
Oh, Walt, is that you?
