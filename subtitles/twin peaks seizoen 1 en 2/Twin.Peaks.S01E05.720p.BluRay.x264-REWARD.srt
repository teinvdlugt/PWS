1
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,692
Yeah.

2
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:57,032
Yeah, his hair was long.
Filthy, gray-on-gray, long hair.

3
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:14,716
I saw him, at the foot of Laura's bed.

4
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,010
He looked like an animal.

5
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,973
- Had you ever seen this man before?
- No, never.

6
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,893
His face. My God, his face.

7
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:29,064
Sarah, did you tell them
about the necklace?

8
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,067
- You're gonna love that one.
- What necklace?

9
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,155
She's had two visions.

10
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,699
Go ahead, Sarah.

11
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,703
Leland.

12
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,455
Sarah.

13
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,418
It's night.

14
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,506
A flashlight beam
moves across the ground.

15
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,467
Then a hand,

16
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,804
a gloved hand,

17
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:06,018
lifts a rock
and takes out a necklace.

18
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,896
Broken in half.

19
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,815
It was Laura's.

20
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,320
Invitation to Love.

21
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,786
Don't fight it, Chet.

22
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:28,582
You know as well as I
there's still something between us.

23
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,376
There always will be.

24
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,629
For God's sake, Emerald.

25
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,883
That may be true,
but I'm married to your sister now.

26
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,176
It's wrong.

27
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,512
Well, you always said
you could never tell us apart, so...

28
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,806
Morning, Lucy. What's going on?

29
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,435
Uh, thanks to Jade,
Jared decided not to kill himself.

30
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,647
And he's changed his will, leaving the
Towers to Jade instead of Emerald,

31
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,524
but Emerald found out about it,
and now she's trying to seduce Chet

32
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,069
to give her the new will
so that she can destroy it.

33
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,987
Montana's planning
to kill Jared at midnight,

34
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,782
so the Towers will belong
to Emerald and Montana,

35
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,702
but I think she's going to double-cross
him and he doesn't know it yet.

36
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,162
Poor Chet.

37
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,706
What's going on here?

38
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:13,293
Uh, Agent Cooper's in
the conference room with Dr. Jacoby.

39
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,962
Thank you.

40
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,800
Lucy, why couldn't I spend the night
last night?

41
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,345
Will you be having coffee,
Deputy Brennan?

42
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,571
Was Laura Palmer seeing you
because she was addicted to cocaine?

43
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,078
Agent Cooper, I'd like to help you,
but, uh, I got a little problem here.

44
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,081
Look, maybe there's some
sort of hula we can do

45
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,043
around my doctor-patient
confidentiality, huh?

46
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,463
It is safe to say she came to you
because she was having problems?

47
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,674
Oh, my, yes.

48
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,135
Were her problems
of a sexual nature?

49
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,928
Agent Cooper,

50
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,766
the problems of our entire society
are of a sexual nature.

51
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,106
Tibet. Hm.

52
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,401
You know, my abiding interests
lie to the east as well,

53
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,237
but only as far as, uh, Hawaii.

54
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:28,327
Ancient Hawaiians often turned to the
soothing rhizome of the ginger plant

55
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,495
to ease the pain
of profound confusion.

56
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,499
Which, more often than not,
was sexual.

57
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,295
Ginger is nonaddictive. Cocaine is.

58
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,090
Look, the fact that Laura Palmer
sought medication,

59
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,844
no matter how dubious,
was actually a positive sign.

60
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,264
Dr. Jacoby, I understand
you cared deeply for Laura Palmer.

61
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,141
Why is it that you won't help us?

62
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:57,731
My own personal investigation,
I suspect,

63
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,443
will be ongoing for the rest of my life.

64
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:07,240
Laura had secrets.

65
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:12,662
And around those secrets,
she built a fortress that...

66
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,250
Well, that in my six months
with her I was not able to penetrate,

67
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:21,338
and for which I consider myself
an abject failure.

68
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:25,175
Doctor, did Laura ever discuss
Bobby Briggs

69
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,594
or James Hurley with you?

70
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,722
Yeah, they were boys.
Laura was a woman.

71
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,309
She had sex with three men
the night she was murdered.

72
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,853
- Were you one of them?
- Heh.

73
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,106
No.

74
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,691
Who killed her, Dr. Jacoby?

75
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,277
The night after Laura died,

76
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:49,199
I followed a man that, uh,
Laura had spoken to me about.

77
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,952
He was driving a red Corvette.

78
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,248
I followed him to the Old Sawmill Road
and then I lost him.

79
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,583
And that, gentlemen,
is all I can tell you.

80
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,044
Agent Cooper,

81
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,421
there's a Gordon Cole on the phone.

82
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,132
He says you're expecting his call.
Should I put him through?

83
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,467
Yes, Lucy, put him through.

84
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,344
Thank you, doctor. That will be all.

85
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,141
You'll be in town, doctor?

86
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:18,311
Well, I'm planning a pilgrimage
to Pebble Beach,

87
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,314
but that's not till
the end of the month.

88
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,025
Hang loose, haoles.

89
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,902
Does Leo Johnson
drive a red Corvette?

90
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,237
Yes.

91
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,824
- How we doing on Jacques Renault?
- There's an APB on him.

92
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,786
His brother made bail this morning.
I got an all-points on him too.

93
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,581
Harry, this is my supervisor.

94
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,293
Good morning, Gordon.
How are we doing?

95
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,794
Cooper, where do we start?

96
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:47,007
The Palmer girl or Albert's
new best friend, Harry Truman?

97
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,968
- Laura Palmer.
- Albert has been very busy.

98
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,847
The twine he found on her upper arms
is a common household variety.

99
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,640
Finley's Fine Twine.

100
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,895
- And the twine on her wrists?
- Definitely not a match. No ID yet.

101
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,521
And those marks on her shoulders?

102
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,732
- Bird bites.
- Bird bites?

103
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,650
He'll also be faxing a reconstruction

104
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,903
of the plastic fragment
from her stomach.

105
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,530
Great, tell Albert
we're anxiously awaiting his results.

106
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,324
Now for the bad news, Coop.

107
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,452
I've got an O.O.J. and an A.F.O. here
from Albert

108
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,205
concerning his mano a mano
with the local Sheriff Truman.

109
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,457
Albert wants this guy's badge, Coop.

110
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,628
Gordon, here's how it is.
You know Albert.

111
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,255
In my opinion, Sheriff Truman
displayed the patience of a saint

112
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,174
not clocking him
a day earlier than he did.

113
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,009
He wants it filed
with the U.S. attorney.

114
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,345
- File it under F for "forget it."
- Cooper.

115
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,889
- Tell Albert if he wants to pursue this...
- Coop.

116
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,016
- I'll fight him
all the way to Washington.

117
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,770
- Don't get excited and hang up, now.
- I'll talk to you later, Gordon.

118
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:47,025
Thanks. Uh, I didn't get
a whole lot of sleep last night.

119
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,611
Harry, the last thing I want you
to worry about while I'm here

120
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,740
is some city slicker I brought into
your town relieving himself upstream.

121
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,162
- This is the man I saw in my dream.
- You saw this man?

122
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,333
I had an intuition that my dream and
Sarah Palmer's vision were connected.

123
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,294
I didn't go with you this morning
because I didn't wanna influence her.

124
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,714
I'm a strong sender.
The eyes were a bit closer together.

125
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,218
Deputy
Hawk calling in for Agent Cooper.

126
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,013
Hawk.

127
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,474
Right. Stay there.

128
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,935
Follow him if he moves.

129
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,604
Traveling east on Highway 12,
how long will it take us

130
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,273
to reach the Timber Falls Motel?

131
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,482
- Half an hour.
- Ten minutes.

132
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,820
- Depends how you go.
- Hawk's found our one-armed man.

133
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,874
I wish I could have seen
Josie's face.

134
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,168
Opening the safe
for her lawman Romeo

135
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,838
to show him the double set of books,

136
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,842
and all she finds
is the one I've been slowly cooking.

137
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,386
Where's the book
that spells bankruptcy?

138
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,847
Mm, I have more than one
hiding place.

139
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,557
Life goes on, trust me.

140
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,684
My desk upstairs.

141
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,272
There's a drop panel
in the top drawer.

142
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,026
Not even Pete the poodle
knows about that one.

143
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,238
I'm famished.

144
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,282
Let's get one thing straight.

145
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,492
I didn't spend 18 months
up the Amazon

146
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,620
dodging blow darts for my health.

147
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:28,418
I suppose room service is too much to
expect of this rusticated mildew farm.

148
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:33,298
You would prefer the Lumber Baron
Suite at the Great Northern?

149
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:37,135
I'd prefer getting on with setting
the torch to that damn mill.

150
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,771
Harry, he's here at the motel.
Room 101.

151
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,397
Last name's Gerard.

152
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:55,362
Now, when the mill goes up in smoke,
the headline that we're after is:

153
00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:00,116
"Josie Packard torches
bankrupt mill in insurance fraud."

154
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,662
Not "Giant weenie roast
in the woods."

155
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,830
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
- Hm? Hm?

156
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,927
Mr. Gerard, it's the police. Open up.

157
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,264
What...? Jeez...

158
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,062
Gunplay? Sounds serious.

159
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,775
Mr. Gerard.

160
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,779
- Don't move.
- Oh, my God.

161
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,281
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

162
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,711
You, uh, let me know
if there's any bloodshed.

163
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:57,298
I'm going to give little Elvis a bath.

164
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,237
What do you mean, you don't
know him? You know this man.

165
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,157
Oh, no, sir. I've never seen
that man before in my life.

166
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,453
But you know something, he kind of
looks like somebody, doesn't he?

167
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,830
Mr. Gerard,
do you have a friend named Bob?

168
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,332
Bob Lydecker's just about
my best friend in the world.

169
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,752
Why have you been
at the hospital the past two days?

170
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,961
Bob's in a coma.

171
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,756
There was a Lydecker
assaulted three days ago outside a bar

172
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,591
in Lotown.

173
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,094
- That's Bob.
- Is your friend Bob a doctor?

174
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,889
He's just about the best
darn veterinarian in these parts.

175
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,515
Thanks.

176
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,519
He's clean. No record, no warrants.

177
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,564
Take a look at his car.

178
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,983
Your middle name is Michael.

179
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,443
Named after my uncle.

180
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,030
- How'd you lose the arm?
- Car accident.

181
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,200
I was on the road
from Memphis to, uh...

182
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,495
Someplace. Selling pharmaceuticals.

183
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,746
Pretty good job.

184
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,669
That's what I'm selling these days.
Everybody needs shoes.

185
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,215
- They're all for the right foot.
- That's my sample case.

186
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,259
Yeah. Two-day delivery, guaranteed.

187
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:26,304
We could certainly take care of
all your departmental needs.

188
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,641
The arm you lost,
did it have a tattoo?

189
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,060
What's this all about?

190
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,313
- I'm a shoe salesman.
- Settle down, Mr. Gerard.

191
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,065
He just asked you a question.

192
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,692
If you won't tell us, we can find out.

193
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,986
What did it say?

194
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:48,785
It said "Mom."

195
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,212
Harry.

196
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,174
What do you got?

197
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,844
Car was already staked out
when I got here.

198
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,388
It was Josie Packard.

199
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,282
I've been doing some research.

200
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,245
In real life, there is no algebra.

201
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,665
Maybe you should run away
and join the circus.

202
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,459
Escape.

203
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,378
I got a better idea.

204
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:46,009
A tall, dark and handsome stranger
falls madly in love with me,

205
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:50,930
takes me away to a life of mystery
and international intrigue.

206
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:55,143
You mean the FBI agent?
Dream on.

207
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,978
Maybe.

208
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,024
Or maybe he'll realize
that I'm the woman of his dreams

209
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,860
because I'm gonna help him
figure out who killed Laura.

210
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,154
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

211
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,489
And you're gonna help me.

212
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:12,160
Fact: Laura was seeing James Hurley
behind Bobby's back.

213
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,664
- What if she was?
- So it is true.

214
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,501
Fact: Laura had a sweet tooth
for nose candy.

215
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,629
Well, I guess
that's not such a big secret.

216
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,507
I didn't know Laura half as well as you,
and I knew the score.

217
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,259
Laura was wild.

218
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,346
Come on, will you help me?

219
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,849
What else have you figured out,
Sherlock?

220
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,603
The morning of the funeral,

221
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,732
Jacoby's talking to my brother Johnny,
trying to get him to go to the funeral.

222
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,985
So he tells Johnny that Laura's
in a better place now, blah, blah, blah.

223
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:51,199
And he knows that
because Laura was his patient.

224
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,121
Laura was seeing Jacoby?

225
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,874
It gets better.
You ever heard of One-Eyed Jack's?

226
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,752
Isn't that that Western
with Marlon Brando?

227
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,632
It's a place across the border.
They have girls working there.

228
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,134
Are you saying you think Laura
was one of them?

229
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,554
I don't know. But if it's true,
wouldn't you wanna know about it?

230
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,723
Well, it sure would explain
a few things.

231
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,186
You know, I think about it.

232
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,982
I think about Laura being in a place
like that and I get all shivery.

233
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,566
But it's like a hot cold,

234
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,861
like when you hold an ice cube
on your bare skin for a long time.

235
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,656
Audrey, I'll help you,

236
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:36,035
but whatever we find out, we have to
promise to keep it between ourselves.

237
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,787
- Our secret.
- It's a deal.

238
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,288
And I know exactly where to start.

239
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,083
Did you know Ronette and Laura
worked in the same place?

240
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,459
No.

241
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:47,672
The perfume counter
at my father's department store.

242
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,108
I've arranged for you to have a little
chat with Hank before the hearing.

243
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,776
He's glad you're here.

244
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,738
I hope I didn't come on
too strong yesterday.

245
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:15,408
I'll be sure to tell him how helpful
you've been, Mr. Mooney.

246
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,475
Haven't seen you for a while, Norma.

247
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,769
Been kind of busy.

248
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:46,606
- So, uh, business is good?
- Yeah.

249
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,071
You gotta back me up in there,
Norma, please.

250
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,530
I gotta get out.

251
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,574
It's starting to put the zap on me,
bigtime.

252
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,369
I know I have no right to ask
and you have no reason to believe me,

253
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,581
but I'll change.

254
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,545
I swear on my life, I have changed.

255
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,509
Give me a chance to prove it to you.

256
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,512
I've replayed it
in my mind a million times,

257
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,181
and I just don't have any answers.

258
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,934
A car in perfect condition
goes out of control.

259
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:28,022
A vagrant nobody knows is killed
while sleeping by the roadside.

260
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,733
Why?
Why did fate deal me this hand?

261
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,653
You are not incarcerated
for an act of fate, Mr. Jennings.

262
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,530
I accept that.

263
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:39,659
But it was fate, maybe in an odd way
even luck, that sent me to prison.

264
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,870
- Just as much as the car accident.
- What is your point?

265
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,666
I know I have a lot to make up for.

266
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,836
For the life I destroyed,

267
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:55,133
and for another life
I very nearly destroyed.

268
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,345
Mrs. Jennings, your husband
would be facing a difficult reentry.

269
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,055
How would you help him?

270
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,392
I own the Double R Diner
in Twin Peaks.

271
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,936
I can give him a job.

272
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,690
The boss is tough but fair.

273
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,360
And you would live together
as man and wife?

274
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,780
Well, he is my husband, isn't he?

275
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,867
Well, we have what we need here.

276
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,370
We'll make our decision
without the inmate present.

277
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,167
We'll let you know by 5:00 today.

278
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,970
Catch you later.

279
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:02,700
In my dream, Mike said he and Bob
lived above a convenience store.

280
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:07,496
Cooper, I'd think you'd be afraid
to go to sleep at night.

281
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,465
Hey, Hawk.

282
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,220
Andy, could you go into the One Stop
and get me some twine?

283
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,930
Okay.

284
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,657
No, that's not Dr. Lydecker.

285
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,494
- Does Dr. Lydecker treat birds?
- Why, yes, of course.

286
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,624
- Rhetta, we're ready for you.
- There are other vets in Twin Peaks.

287
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,168
Yes, but only one
has a best friend with one arm.

288
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:58,631
Harry, in the heat
of the investigative pursuit,

289
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,551
the shortest distance between two
points is not necessarily a straight line.

290
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,847
Andy, hand me that spool
of Finley's Fine Twine.

291
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,518
Ms. Loomer, we're gonna have to
confiscate your files.

292
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,019
What?

293
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,146
Harry, as clear as the signs
on the turnpike,

294
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:18,276
the bird that attacked Laura Palmer
is a client of this office.

295
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,919
I feel so bad for you.

296
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,257
I was watching you at the funeral
and my heart was aching.

297
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,385
I wanted to hold you so much.

298
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,265
That James Hurley.

299
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,727
He was seeing Laura
behind my back.

300
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,482
- I'm gonna fix him.
- Fix me first.

301
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,698
When is Leo due back?

302
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:11,620
Don't worry, bad boy.
I can hear his Vette a mile away.

303
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:17,084
Don't mess around with this, Shelly.
Where is he?

304
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,797
He's with his friend,
that creepy Jacques.

305
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,470
Jacques who?

306
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,015
That Canuck guy
that works at the Roadhouse.

307
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,852
- Leo and Jacques?
- What's the matter?

308
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,233
Gotta think. I gotta think...

309
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,069
Um, well, think later, Bobby.

310
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:46,072
I have to go back to the diner
in a half an hour.

311
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,492
I gotta tell you something.

312
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,619
What? What is it?

313
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,580
I've been onto this for a while.
I've been checking it out.

314
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,707
- It's pretty bad.
- Tell me.

315
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:01,253
Leo and Jacques are running drugs
across the border.

316
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,965
Cocaine. And they've been
selling them at school.

317
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,636
I knew it. I knew Leo
was messed up in something.

318
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:12,431
I think it's even possible
they were giving drugs to Laura.

319
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,559
Bobby,
I have to show you something.

320
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:25,027
This was in Leo's truck
two days after Laura was murdered.

321
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,822
You sure this is Leo's?

322
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,992
It has his initials sewn in the collar.

323
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,829
He makes me sew them
into everything.

324
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,833
Shelly, this...

325
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,628
This could be the answer
to our prayers.

326
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,422
What do you mean?

327
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:51,387
You don't need to know.
I'm gonna take this, okay?

328
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,056
You never saw this.

329
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:58,102
Say it. "I never saw it."

330
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,062
I never saw it.

331
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,441
Leo's not gonna be
a problem for us anymore.

332
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,527
Stay clear of him and keep quiet.

333
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:16,078
- I bought this.
- You know how to use it?

334
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,667
I thought you could teach me.

335
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,295
Teach me, Bobby.

336
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,554
Fellas, take them
right into the conference room.

337
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,973
Lucy, I need you
to go through these files

338
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,142
and pull out all the people
who own birds.

339
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,897
- How will I know they own birds?
- It'll say so on the cards.

340
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,818
Okay, I'll start going
through the files, then.

341
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,575
Agent Cooper, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.

342
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,744
My gun just slipped out of my hand.

343
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,246
Andy, have you ever used
your weapon in the line of duty?

344
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,166
No, sir, I haven't.
I can't explain what happened.

345
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,126
I've been feeling a little high-strung.

346
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,087
Well, it was lack
of preparation. We'll take care of that.

347
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,131
Andy, get some ammunition
from the lockbox,

348
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,759
meet us downstairs
at the pistol range.

349
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,936
Lucy, did you hear what happened?
I feel so dumb.

350
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,647
I dropped my gun and it went off.

351
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,650
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah, I guess so, but...

352
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:31,153
I would like to chat, but I am now
under orders to examine these files,

353
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,240
so if you'll excuse me, please.

354
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,829
Laura Palmer's murder
was vicious and calculated.

355
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,791
There's no telling what we'll encounter
bringing a suspect to ground.

356
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,544
After Andy's mishap at the motel,
I wanna make absolutely certain

357
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,963
each of us is comfortable
and confident with our firearms.

358
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,172
Nice piece.

359
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,300
Actually, it's standard issue.
I made a few modifications.

360
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,470
How long has Lucy
been upset with Andy?

361
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,805
Body language?

362
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,182
In this case,
it was yelling through a megaphone.

363
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,811
- Six rounds apiece to start with, Andy.
- Okay.

364
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,356
Care to tell us
about you and Lucy, Andy?

365
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,108
Jeez, you can tell?

366
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,318
Not too many secrets
left around here.

367
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,322
She won't speak to me,
and I don't know why.

368
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,950
And I don't know why she's doing
what she's doing.

369
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,286
I just can't figure her out.

370
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,372
Well, there's no logic at work here,
Andy. Let that one go.

371
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,582
In the grand design,

372
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,126
women were drawn
from a different set of blueprints.

373
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,670
- Amen to that.
- Amen.

374
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,006
Hawk, Andy.

375
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,468
Rapid fire.

376
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,236
Hawk. Six for six, two kills.
High marks.

377
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,238
Andy.

378
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,199
Andy, what we need is practice
and lots of it.

379
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,454
One hour, three times a week.
Harry, you'll supply the ordnance?

380
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,664
Whatever it takes.

381
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,875
Chin up, Andy.

382
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,630
- You ever been married, Cooper?
- No.

383
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:17,843
I knew someone once who
helped me understand commitment,

384
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,971
the responsibilities and the risks.

385
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,643
Who taught me the pain
of a broken heart.

386
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,951
One woman
can make you fly like an eagle,

387
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:46,246
another can give you the strength
of a lion.

388
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:50,417
But only one in the cycle of life
can fill your heart with wonder

389
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:54,046
and the wisdom that you have known
a singular joy.

390
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,258
- I wrote that for my girlfriend.
- Local gal?

391
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,845
Diane Shapiro, Ph.D., Brandeis.

392
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:09,436
Harry, one miss, five hits, three kills.
Excellent.

393
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,566
Only four hits?

394
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,070
I put four through the eyes
and one through each nostril.

395
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,655
Nice pattern.

396
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,866
Agent Cooper, I'm
looking at the files from Dr. Lydecker's.

397
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,035
And for instance,
I have here in the A's an Arky,

398
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,955
who's a part poodle, part rottweiler

399
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,207
who lives on Maple
and belongs to Mr. Rumple.

400
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,127
Then, for example, I have an Annette,
who's an otter

401
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,962
who lives with a family
near Elk River.

402
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,214
We wanted the name of birds.

403
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,092
I know, but the files
are all organized alphabetically.

404
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,261
Lucy, go through the bird file.

405
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,929
No, no, you don't understand.

406
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:48,225
They're organized alphabetically
in the names of the pet.

407
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,686
We're gonna need
some more coffee.

408
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:09,621
Thanks, Toad. I'll be sure to get this
into my retirement fund ASAP.

409
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,587
Shelly, you're gonna
scare the customers.

410
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,924
I've got one man too many in my life,
and I'm married to him.

411
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:25,471
- Sound familiar?
- You should have a little talk with Leo.

412
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,435
Leo doesn't talk. He hits.

413
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,189
He was so great at first, you know?

414
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,650
This flashy guy in his hot car.

415
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,152
Then we get married,

416
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,573
and I find out all he was looking for
was a maid he didn't have to pay.

417
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,869
I feel so stupid.

418
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,039
Look at us.

419
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,584
Two men apiece,

420
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,712
and we don't know what to do
with any of the four of them.

421
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,006
So how did Hank's hearing go?

422
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,509
They're not gonna decide
till this afternoon.

423
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,677
Have you told him
you're divorcing him for Ed?

424
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,891
When I saw him, I, uh...

425
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,519
He might not even get out
this time around.

426
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,272
Guess my plans
are a little up in the air.

427
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,820
Yeah, well,
I've definitely got plans for Leo.

428
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,912
You know what we're gonna do,
Shelly?

429
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,123
Tomorrow you and I are gonna have
a day of beauty.

430
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,919
A manicure, a facial, we're gonna have
our hair done, the works.

431
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,421
We're gonna be the knockouts
of the Double R.

432
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,590
It's my treat.

433
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,133
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

434
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,927
- Donna?
- Hi, James.

435
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,971
- Donna!
- Hold on.

436
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,390
Who the heck ever heard
of diet lasagna?

437
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,517
Just a sec, Daddy.
I'll be right in, okay?

438
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,477
- It's James.
- Hm.

439
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,938
Hi, we're having this
church potluck dinner here tonight.

440
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,440
Well, tell him
to get over here. I need help.

441
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,775
- SOS.
- Okay.

442
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,610
Mayday, mayday.

443
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,820
Would you like to come?

444
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,989
I don't think
I'd be very good company.

445
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:10,284
Well, I think we need to talk. Um...

446
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,036
I've found out some things.

447
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,498
Audrey told me some stuff
and Mrs. Palmer saw something.

448
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,376
- What?
- Well, if you come over, I can tell you.

449
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,129
I'm gonna get something to eat.
Then I'll be over in a little bit.

450
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,464
Okay. Bye.

451
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,893
Hi.

452
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,103
Who are you?

453
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,315
My name's Madeleine Ferguson.

454
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:45,652
- Laura was my cousin.
- James Hurley.

455
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,490
Laura and I hadn't
seen each other much recently.

456
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,867
I live in Missoula.

457
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:56,038
- Did you know Laura well?
- I thought I did. Heh.

458
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,040
Here you go.
I've got your order ready.

459
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,208
- Thanks a lot.
Mm-hm.

460
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:05,047
I'm picking up food
for my aunt and uncle.

461
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:09,217
Aunt Sarah can't cook right now,
and Uncle Leland's up half the night

462
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,678
listening to old music
and crying and stuff.

463
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,641
But if I was cooking for them,
they'd be doing even worse. Heh. Heh.

464
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:21,813
- Um, you think I look like Laura?
- Yes.

465
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,025
We used to come visit Twin Peaks
when I was a kid.

466
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,487
It was great.
We'd pretend we were sisters.

467
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,990
I wish I'd known her better.

468
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,701
It's so sad.

469
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:41,208
Well, it was nice to meet you,
James Hurley.

470
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,335
Nice to meet you too.

471
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,263
Thanks for calling, Mr. Mooney.

472
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,525
Are you okay?

473
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,278
Hank got his parole.

474
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,991
He's coming home.

475
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,958
What's that?

476
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:28,422
No, I don't know what you get when
you cross a Norwegian and a Swede.

477
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,091
Oh, very good, sir, very good.

478
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,094
I can't tell you how excited we are

479
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,473
about bringing Icelandic investment
to the great Northwest.

480
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,101
Would you put my brother
back on, please?

481
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:47,024
Jerry, who the hell is that joker?
You're sure that he's the boss?

482
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:51,028
Just make sure they don't start
taking eggnog in to the pilot.

483
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:56,158
Jer, I've got the jet gassed up
and on the runway in Seattle.

484
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,827
Usher these guys through customs,
make your connection,

485
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:04,624
and save me some of whatever it is
that they're having. Ha-ha.

486
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,169
Yeah.

487
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,006
Oh, Audrey.
I didn't hear you come in.

488
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,009
What is it this time?

489
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,637
Dad, are you ashamed of me?

490
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,890
Audrey, you're, uh...

491
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,642
You're my daughter.

492
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,062
I was thinking about
what we talked about the other night

493
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,938
when you were so mad.

494
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,775
It isn't that I'm ashamed of you,
Audrey.

495
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,986
It's just that I wish
I could depend on you more,

496
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,947
especially during a trying time
like this.

497
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,992
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

498
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,162
Dad, I wanna change my life.

499
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,957
I've decided I wanna help you
with the family business.

500
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,877
I mean, one of these days
you'll need someone to take over,

501
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,004
and obviously
it's not gonna be Johnny.

502
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,883
Heh-heh. Oh, Audrey,
I wish that I could believe you.

503
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,094
Daddy, please.

504
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:05,852
I saw a friend of mine cut down like
a flower that had just begun to bloom.

505
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,650
Life can be so short.

506
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,320
There isn't all the time in the world,

507
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,491
I see that now,
and I wanna change my life.

508
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,077
How, exactly?

509
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,954
I don't need to go to college.

510
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,288
You can teach me the business,

511
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,582
and I'm willing to start
at the absolute bottom.

512
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,877
All right.
We've got some guests arriving.

513
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,131
You go upstairs
and start making some beds.

514
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,591
You still don't believe me?

515
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,427
All right. Okay.

516
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:43,890
Okay. All right, all right.

517
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,643
Where would you start?

518
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,855
Well, I think I should start
at the department store.

519
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:53,191
Cosmetics or something.
Just part-time at first, till I graduate.

520
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,862
You're really serious, aren't you?

521
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:01,074
You have to start to think about
the future, Daddy, just like I am.

522
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:05,328
- The future?
- Our family's future.

523
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,291
Please let me be
your daughter again.

524
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,841
Audrey...

525
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,406
Hello, this is Benjamin Horne.

526
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,533
Uh...

527
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,286
I have to take this, sweetheart.

528
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,496
Oh, okay.

529
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,292
Thanks, Daddy.

530
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,804
Thank you, Audrey.

531
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,939
Where have you been?

532
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:18,235
Meet me down by the river
in a half-hour.

533
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,612
And be discreet.

534
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,537
Here's a bird. Louis Armstrong.
He's a parakeet.

535
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,789
Put it with the others.

536
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:31,998
Agent Cooper,

537
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,541
I've got Gordon Cole on the phone.

538
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,960
- Cooper here.
- Coop,

539
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:38,213
Albert is faxing you his reconstruction
of the plastic object

540
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,173
found in Laura Palmer's stomach.

541
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,218
He's also determined the bites and
marks on her shoulders were made

542
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,971
by a parrot or a myna bird.

543
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,890
That's it. You're up to date.

544
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,727
- Take a look at this.
- Something with the letter J.

545
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,313
Poker chip.

546
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,148
One-Eyed Jack's.

547
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,693
Waldo!

548
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,321
Harry, Agent Cooper,
it's a myna bird named Waldo.

549
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,615
A myna bird
owned by Jacques Renault.

550
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,493
I'll get his home address.

551
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,329
Gentlemen, when two separate events
occur simultaneously

552
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,374
pertaining to the same object
of inquiry,

553
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,711
we must always pay strict attention.

554
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,754
Fellas, let's make a house call.

555
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,847
Nice game.

556
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:53,204
Jacques, it's Harry Truman.
Open the door.

557
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,884
- He's headed around the side.
- Go get him.

558
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,311
Let's get Forensics
and seal this room, Harry.

559
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,272
- Harry?
- Yeah, Hawk.

560
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,941
He got away from me.
I lost him in the woods.

561
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,610
Harry?

562
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:31,868
"L.J." Leo Johnson.
Leo Johnson and Jacques Renault.

563
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,620
That's our connection.

564
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,934
Hm?

565
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,311
Nice touch, Leo, nice touch.

566
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,773
Bright-red sports car
for a secret meeting. Nice.

567
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,192
- You don't like it, get somebody else.
- Oh, no, no.

568
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,361
Hank said that you were gifted.
I believed him.

569
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:10,198
But, Leo, your whole approach,
it's misguided.

570
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,368
Major career opportunity
staring you in the face,

571
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:17,914
and all you can think about is car wax
and chicken-feed drug transactions.

572
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,709
Hey, I'm out $10,000. Maybe
that's peanuts to you, not to me.

573
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:26,256
You were in business with a couple
glue-sniffing squish-heads, Leo.

574
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,801
The Renault brothers?
I broke up their act.

575
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,886
This is Bernie.

576
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,056
Jacques is back in Canada.
We had a long talk.

577
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,517
He's staying there.

578
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,812
Jacques was the brains in the outfit.

579
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,440
Bernie made bail this morning
on possession.

580
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:49,237
Ahem. And do we know
if, uh, the late Bernard gave you up?

581
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,698
I told him if he ever did, I'd kill him.

582
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,908
Oh, and did he?

583
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:58,663
No, he shouldn't have trusted me,
but like I said, Bernie wasn't too bright.

584
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:03,877
Okay. One last chance, Leo.
Don't disappoint me.

585
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:07,172
- The mill?
- Keep it simple.

586
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:13,052
Insurance investigator should read
arson, block letters, about 6 feet high.

587
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,638
The deal as we discussed?

588
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,182
The rest on delivery.

589
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,393
Three nights, Leo. Green light.

590
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,395
Is that clear enough?

591
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,900
But if Mrs. Palmer
knows about the necklace...

592
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,068
- How? How could she know?
- She said she saw it.

593
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:33,072
She said she had a vision
and she saw someone take it.

594
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,991
Donna.

595
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,078
Donna, it's not here.

596
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,790
Somebody must have seen us.
Somebody must have followed us here.

597
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,377
How?
How could Mrs. Palmer know?

598
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,131
Laura used to say
her mother was kind of spooky.

599
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,383
She used to see things.
She had these dreams.

600
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,677
Laura did too.

601
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:05,813
- Maybe we should tell somebody.
- You mean the police?

602
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,316
Well, if it was the killer,
then he knows that we know.

603
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:12,403
James, the police didn't love Laura.
Nobody loved her but us.

604
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,325
I keep thinking I'm gonna see her.

605
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,036
I think that, you know,
I'm gonna catch a glimpse of her

606
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,996
out of the corner of my eye.

607
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,374
Sometimes it's like
I really do see her.

608
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:28,586
James, listen.
We're gonna find out who killed her.

609
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,548
This is about us.

610
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:36,594
We have to do this for us,
not just for her.

611
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:53,695
James, I wanna be with you.

612
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,548
Hello?

613
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,841
Josie, it's me.

614
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,217
Hi.

615
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:20,638
We just got a break
in the Palmer case. I can't get away.

616
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,475
- I miss you. I need to talk to you.
- I wanna talk to you too.

617
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,563
Josie, were you at the
Timber Falls Motel this afternoon?

618
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:33,151
Eh, I have to go.
Um, call me tomorrow?

619
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,444
Goodbye.

620
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,745
Blow the whistle, Josie.
It's quitting time.

621
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,705
How did the shift go, Pete?

622
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:50,543
Oh, cut some wood,
made some lumber.

623
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,839
- I'm so tired, I could...
- You could eat a horse?

624
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:59,260
- I made you a turkey sandwich.
- Oh, that's fantastic, Josie.

625
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:02,889
- Uh, is Catherine asleep?
- Yeah.

626
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,017
Good, then give me some mayo
with that.

627
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:12,565
Josie, uh, how do you feel about fish?

628
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,443
- To eat?
- No, to catch.

629
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,905
See, the Fishing Association,

630
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:23,576
their annual do is coming up,
and, uh, I'm defending champion.

631
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,955
And this year, well, they're adding
a mixed-doubles division,

632
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:33,753
and I thought, well,
if you were interested, uh,

633
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:39,175
what the heck, uh, would you like to,
uh, partner up with me?

634
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,845
Well, Pete, I don't know the first step
about fishing.

635
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:47,517
Oh, Josie, there's enough
fishing in me for the both of us.

636
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,853
- Well, what do you think?
- Sure, Pete.

637
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,523
Let's give it the run at the money.

638
00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:00,530
Josie, you're my kind of gal.
Here. I'm gonna hit the hay.

639
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:04,951
- Sweet dreams, Pete.
- Sweet dreams, Josie.

640
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,324
Hello.

641
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,744
Did you get my message?

642
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:48,953
Yes.

643
00:45:52,916 --> 00:47:00,358
Catch you later.
