1
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,765
There.

2
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,729
That's them.

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,044
Your play, Walter.
You're on your own.

4
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,851
Looks like you're about 1000 gallons
light here, Mike.

5
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,565
Where's the juice?

6
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,527
The methylamine isn't coming.

7
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,609
Why is that?

8
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,570
- And who the hell are you?
- I'm the man who's keeping it.

9
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,441
What the hell's this?

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,166
We had an agreement, right?
We got our deal.

11
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,685
So where's the tank, Mike?

12
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,605
Mike doesn't know where it is.
Only I do.

13
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,603
And you're dealing with me now,
not him.

14
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,001
Why don't you just cut
to what it is you want...

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,606
...or what you think
is gonna happen here, all right?

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,603
Because we're gonna get
what we came for.

17
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,809
That 1000 gallons of methylamine
is worth more in my hands...

18
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,850
...than it is in yours or
anyone else's, for that matter.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,561
But I need distribution.

20
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,251
Distribution.

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,164
That's right.

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,002
So if you agree
to give up your cook...

23
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,640
...and sell my product instead...

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,003
...I'll give you 35
percent of the take.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,924
Thirty-five percent?

26
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,048
Wow, are you kidding me?
Thirty-five--

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,124
Mike, please tell me this is a joke.

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,602
Know how far we had to stick our necks
out to get our hands on this cash?

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,401
Why the hell would we want you? You
know we have our own operation, right?

30
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,848
I know all about your operation.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,322
See, my partners here tell me
that you produce a meth...

32
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,768
...that's 70 percent pure,
if you're lucky.

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,210
What I produce is 99.1 percent pure.

34
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,691
So?

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,889
So it's grade school T-ball...

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,441
...versus the New York Yankees.

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,889
Yours is just some tepid...

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,442
...off-brand, generic cola.

39
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,247
What I'm making is Classic Coke.

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,882
All right. Okay.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,728
So if we just waste you
right here right now...

42
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,450
...and leave you in the desert...

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,410
...then there is no more Coke
on the market, right?

44
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,040
See how that works? There's only us.

45
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,965
Do you really wanna live
in a world without Coca-Cola?

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,363
My partner tells me
that your crew...

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,569
...switched to a P2P cook
because of our success.

48
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,207
You dye your meth with food colouring
to make it look like mine.

49
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,524
You already ape my product
at every turn.

50
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,565
But now...

51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,291
...you have the opportunity
to sell it yourself.

52
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,891
I need you to listen to me.

53
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,963
We're not gonna give up this deal...

54
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,090
...to be your errand boys,
do you understand?

55
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,489
For what?

56
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,768
To watch a bunch of junkies
get a better high?

57
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,481
A better high
means customers pay more.

58
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,565
A higher purity means
a greater yield.

59
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,122
That's 130 million
dollars of profit...

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,285
...that isn't being pissed away
by some substandard cook.

61
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,562
Now you listen to me.

62
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,841
You've got the greatest meth
cook in A-- No, the two...

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,881
...greatest meth cooks in America
right here, and with our skills...

64
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,010
...you'll earn more
from that 35 percent...

65
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,810
...than you ever would on your own.

66
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,122
Yeah. So you say.

67
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,322
Just wondering why we're so lucky.

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,570
Why cut us in?

69
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,166
Mike is retiring from our crew...

70
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,891
...so his share of the partnership
is available...

71
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,211
...if you can handle his end,
distribution...

72
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,650
...and if you give him 5 million dollars
of the 15 million that you brought today.

73
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,840
Just think of it as a finder's fee
for bringing us together.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,245
We have 40 pounds of product
ready to ship, ready to go.

75
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,123
Are you ready?

76
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,009
Who the hell are you?

77
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,280
You know.

78
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,009
You all know exactly who I am.

79
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,165
Say my name.

80
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,402
Do what? I don't have a damn clue
who the hell you are.

81
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,888
Yeah, you do. I'm the cook.

82
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,565
I'm the man who killed Gus Fring.

83
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,564
Bullshit. Cartel got Fring.

84
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,524
Are you sure?

85
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,130
That's right.

86
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,251
Now, say my name.

87
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,330
You're Heisenberg.

88
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,487
You're goddamn right.

89
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,610
I gotta hand it to you, Walter.

90
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,250
Hey.

91
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,085
I appreciate the kind words...

92
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,323
...but I'm out too, remember?

93
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,241
I know. We'll talk.

94
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,806
Maybe we should talk about how and
when I'm gonna get my 5 million dollars.

95
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,883
And we will do that.

96
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,565
Absolutely.

97
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,366
It's just, you know--

98
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,569
Look, Jesse, just give me
some time here, okay?

99
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,929
I'll need help getting things up
and running during this transition.

100
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,367
You can at least do
that for me, right?

101
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,328
Come on. Don't worry.
We'll figure it out.

102
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,762
Well, I guess that's it.

103
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,849
Parting thoughts,
of which I have two:

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,843
First, as I said...

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,162
...I'll handle the legacy costs
out of my end...

106
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,484
...so you won't have to worry about
my guys anymore. Second, the bug.

107
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,923
The DEA will do a sweep.
Can't say when, could be anytime.

108
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,966
But you need to get it out of there,
sooner rather than later.

109
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,291
All right.

110
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,207
That's it?

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,723
No "thanks for the 5 million dollars," no
"sorry for chaining you to a radiator"?

112
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,405
Just get the bug, Walter.

113
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,049
So, hey.

114
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,284
I guess

115
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,408
I guess I'll see you around.

116
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,006
No. Don't think so.

117
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,208
When I'm out, I'm out.

118
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,205
Well, I'm out too, Mike.

119
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,409
Kid, just look out for yourself.

120
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,249
- Are we good?
- You tell me.

121
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,762
Okay, Jesse. Back it up.

122
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,405
You're good. Keep it coming.
Straight back.

123
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,289
Slow it down.

124
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,324
All right. That's good.

125
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,605
Hey, Mrs. White.

126
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,089
"Vamonos."

127
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,848
I Wish.

128
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,765
All right. Let's get
this thing hooked up.

129
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,160
Walt.

130
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,084
What is this?

131
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,450
Do you really wanna know?

132
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,248
- Why are you hiding it here?
- Don't worry about it.

133
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,004
Who are you hiding it from?

134
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,845
I said don't worry about it.

135
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,126
From the police?

136
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,404
Or someone else?

137
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,209
Someone who would kill for it?

138
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,522
Why don't you go back in the office?

139
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,406
Why don't you go back in the office
and let us do this?

140
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,642
We'll get it out of your hair.

141
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,208
What'd you bring me this time?

142
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,004
They're bacon banana cookies.

143
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,209
Is there bacon in these? Oh, my God!

144
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,129
Just bits.
Just little bits of bacon.

145
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,971
Just enough to make
those suckers really pop.

146
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,006
Dan, this is too much.

147
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,321
I'm not sharing those.

148
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,403
Bad office etiquette?
I don't give a crap.

149
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,086
- They're mine.
- They're yours to do with as you please.

150
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,005
Good, because my husband's
not getting any either.

151
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,288
- How is Mickey?
- Don't get me started.

152
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,965
He wants to buy a boat.

153
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,885
I can't even get him
to start the lawnmower...

154
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,042
...and he wants to buy a boat.

155
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,168
I don't know. A boat might be nice.

156
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,163
A little one, maybe.

157
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,210
Oh, please.
Where would you even take a boat?

158
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,840
All the way down to Elephant Butte?

159
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,164
Or Caballo.
It's beautiful down there.

160
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,284
You can even leave it at the lake
if you don't want to haul it.

161
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,411
We're not buying a boat,
I'll tell you that right now.

162
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,804
- And the last one is 545.
- 569.

163
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,523
- Dang it. I almost got them all that time.
- Very good.

164
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,651
But actually, I've got an extra one
for you this week. 603.

165
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,442
- 603. Where is that?
- Right down there.

166
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,924
All right. I'll let you get to it.

167
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,730
Thanks, Dot.

168
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,766
Young Kaylee's gonna need
a second safety deposit box...

169
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,730
...if you decide to leave
one more dollar to her.

170
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,164
How's the rest of it?

171
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,362
Oh, it's empty, as usual.

172
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,251
The families are pretty reliable
with the pickups.

173
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,607
Nobody complaining
about wanting it all at once?

174
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,606
No, they get it.
Slow and steady wins the race.

175
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,366
So I guess this is it for a while?

176
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,682
Don't worry about the families.

177
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,247
They'll keep getting
their deliveries.

178
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,731
<i>I know times are tight,
but it's for the kids...</i>

179
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,611
<i>...and your sponsorship
would sure be appreciated.</i>

180
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,651
<i>Yeah, we have a silver level,
but the gold and platinum levels...</i>

181
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,647
<i>...really get your name out there
on the banners and T-shirts.</i>

182
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,251
<i>Sure. No, that's not a problem. You call
me directly if things change, you hear?</i>

183
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,601
<i>Gomey, take a brick to my head if I
ever have to make another Fun Run call.</i>

184
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,762
<i>I'm done.</i>

185
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,201
<i>What's up? Why you smiling?</i>

186
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,408
<i>Because the Ehrmantraut warrant
just came in.</i>

187
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,530
<i>Now we're talking. How quick
can you get your group together?</i>

188
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,165
<i>- Two, three hours.
- Make it two.</i>

189
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,527
<i>We're gonna nail that son of a bi--</i>

190
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,451
Police! Search warrant!

191
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,049
Police! Search warrant!

192
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,244
Coming. Hold your horses.

193
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,643
Search warrant.

194
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,404
Police! Search warrant!

195
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,643
- Police. Search warrant.
- Police. Search warrant.

196
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,326
How's that restraining order
working out for you?

197
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,323
If you want me to read that,
I'm gonna need my glasses.

198
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,124
<i>Too bad you had to make the trip out
from headquarters, sergeant.</i>

199
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,046
<i>From out of bed, you mean. When a cop
kills himself, they want a full report.</i>

200
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,283
<i>Just to say hello to who's in charge
of the Record Bureau.</i>

201
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,490
<i>A single contact wound.</i>

202
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,802
<i>Powder burn on his temple
and right hand.</i>

203
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,564
<i>Suicide, I'll bet you.</i>

204
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,768
<i>- Tell the wagon boys they can have him.
- Yes.</i>

205
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,811
<i>When I found him, he was...
He was dead.</i>

206
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,489
Hey! Perfect timing.

207
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,881
Just about to get started.

208
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,931
You know, if you can get going
on that settling tank...

209
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,128
...that would be a huge help.

210
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,002
We left that stuff in there too long
after the last cook.

211
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,401
- Mr. White--
- I mean way too long.

212
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,841
Now we have a tremendous amount
of residue.

213
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,890
You know what we need to invest in
is a power washer.

214
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,568
Mr. White, can we just take a second
and talk about all this?

215
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,849
Yeah, yeah, sure.

216
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,405
Yeah.

217
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,328
Look, you know what I think
we need to talk about?

218
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,644
Is doubling down.

219
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,569
Doubling down?

220
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,048
Cooking 100 pounds a week,
not 50.

221
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,171
As in starting a new lab,
a lab that you'll run.

222
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,482
A cook all of your own.

223
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,521
Why not? You deserve it.

224
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,331
You're every bit as good as me.

225
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,525
Well, what do you think?

226
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,801
Mr. White, I think that
nothing has changed for me.

227
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,085
I just wanna get my money
and get out.

228
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,491
Jesse, this...

229
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,322
What we do...

230
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,931
...being the best at something...

231
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,570
...is a very rare thing.

232
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,644
You don't just toss
something like that away.

233
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,928
And what, you wanna squander
that potential?

234
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,970
Your potential? Why?

235
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,770
To do what?

236
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,611
- I don't know.
- Well, think.

237
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,809
To do what, Jesse?

238
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,003
I'll-- I'll figure it out,
all right?

239
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,207
Look at you.

240
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,600
What have you got in your life, huh?
Nothing. Nobody.

241
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,564
Oh, wait. Yes.

242
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,081
- Video games and go-carts
- Mr. W--

243
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,164
And when you get tired of that,
what then?

244
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,290
And how soon will you
start using again?

245
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,162
Look

246
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,247
Look, I know how upset you are
about what happened to this boy.

247
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,920
I am just as upset as you are.

248
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,323
Are you? Really?

249
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,484
How can you say that to me? Jesus!

250
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,041
I mean, I'm the one
who's the father here.

251
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,522
What, do I have to curl up in a ball
in tears in front of you?

252
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,366
Do I have to lock myself away in a
room and get high to prove it to you?

253
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,330
What happened to that boy
is a tragedy...

254
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,687
...and it tears me up inside!

255
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,526
But because it happened, what,
am I supposed to just lie down...

256
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,327
...and die with him? It's done!

257
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,170
It makes me sick that it happened...

258
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,164
...just like everyone else
who has died in our wake.

259
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,566
What Todd did...

260
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,441
...you and I have done things
that are just as bad.

261
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,965
Yeah.

262
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,411
All the people that we've killed,
Gale and the rest.

263
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,042
If you believe that there's a hell,
I don't know if you're into that...

264
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,921
...but we're already pretty much
going there, right?

265
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,443
But I'm not gonna lie down
until I get there.

266
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,965
What, just because I don't wanna
cook meth anymore, I'm lying down?

267
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,361
How many more people
are gonna die because of us?

268
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,807
No one. None.

269
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,566
Now that we're in control,
no one else gets hurt

270
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,247
You keep saying that,
and it's bullshit every time!

271
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,568
- No.
- Always! You know what?

272
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,042
I'm done, okay?

273
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:30,082
You just give me my money,
and you and I, we're done.

274
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,724
Okay.

275
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,961
Why?

276
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,927
Why do you want this money?

277
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,451
Because it's mine. It's my cut.

278
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,007
But isn't it filthy blood money?

279
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,448
I mean, you're so pure.
You have such emotional depth.

280
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,371
No, no, no. You shouldn't touch
that dirty money.

281
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,881
I'll save you from that, Jesse.

282
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,770
Come on.

283
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,407
You want it.

284
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,040
You want it just as
much as I want it.

285
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,410
And it's not wrong to want it. Okay?

286
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,246
So stay and work with me...

287
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,643
...and you can make ten ti--
Twenty times as much.

288
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,002
Whatever, man.

289
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,368
You don't wanna pay me,
I don't care.

290
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,411
- Yes, you do.
- It's on you, all right?

291
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,086
- I'm done.
- No, you're not.

292
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,451
You're not done. You're not leaving.
Because if you leave, you get nothing!

293
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,763
Do you understand me? Nothing!

294
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,449
Jesse!

295
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,924
<i>Budget for the current fiscal year
for electronic surveillance...</i>

296
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,489
<i>...is 1.5 million, on par with
ATF and the Marshal Service...</i>

297
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,961
<i>...but still just a
fraction of FBI totals.</i>

298
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,521
<i>We're lobbying Congress
for an additional 1.41</i>

299
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,365
<i>...but we're waiting on action
reports to demonstrate...</i>

300
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,650
<i>...we 're actually getting worthwhile
results. Our undercover operations...</i>

301
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,320
<i>...reap the most successful
actionable intelligence...</i>

302
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,211
<i>...if you refer to the chart
in Appendix 4.</i>

303
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,285
<i>If ASAC Schrader can tell us about
the surveillance man-hours.</i> . . <i>.</i>

304
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,845
<i>Hank?</i>

305
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,010
<i>Hank?</i>

306
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,764
<i>Hank!</i>

307
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,331
<i>I think we're going to wrap this up.</i>

308
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,485
<i>If ASAC Schrader can stay behind
while everyone else clears out.</i>

309
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,805
<i>Thank you, everybody.</i>

310
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,204
<i>You know no one wants...</i>

311
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,727
<i>...to see you succeed at this
more than me, right?</i>

312
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,048
<i>- Yes, sir.
- I know how good you are.</i>

313
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,090
<i>I wouldn't have stuck my neck out
to get you here if I didn't.</i>

314
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,641
<i>But you're not knocking down
doors anymore, bubba.</i>

315
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,124
<i>You're in charge of a district office,
and that comes with responsibilities.</i>

316
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,604
<i>I mean, Hank, basic reports aren't
being filed in a timely manner.</i>

317
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,444
I'll work on it. It'll get better.

318
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,080
<i>Yeah, it will, because way too much
time and money...</i>

319
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,602
<i>...is being spent on the Fring case,
a case which is essentially over.</i>

320
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,164
<i>All this overtime to surveil
Michael Ehrmantraut?</i>

321
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,800
<i>That's just money that could
be better spent elsewhere.</i>

322
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,083
I understand, but I'm not making
these choices lightly.

323
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,891
We've got increased reports
of blue meth on the street...

324
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,931
...Fring's gang is still operational, and
Ehrmantraut is involved. It's that simple.

325
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,446
<i>I believe you. But so what?</i>

326
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,365
<i>It's one case out of dozens,
and you don't play favourites...</i>

327
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,444
<i>- ...with it because it used to be yours.
- I really think--</i>

328
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,246
<i>Don't play favourites.
You got a bigger job than that.</i>

329
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,528
<i>I mean, forget the financial cost.</i>

330
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,923
<i>I hear you're personally serving
search warrants out in the field?</i>

331
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,401
That was an error in judgment.
Won't happen again.

332
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,723
<i>You're damn right it won't.
I'm just gonna bottom-line this for you.</i>

333
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,441
<i>The surveillance budget for
Ehrmantraut is now zero. We clear?</i>

334
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,411
Sure. Thank you.

335
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,768
- Clear.
- Good.

336
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,689
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

337
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,930
Yeah?

338
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,651
- Hey.
- Hey.

339
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,251
So Ramey wanted
to catch up with you?

340
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,886
Talk sports and stuff, I guess?

341
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,530
Yeah, something like that.

342
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,251
No more following Ehrmantraut.

343
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,609
Not worth the financial investment.

344
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,842
Well, it's not like
the guy's going anywhere.

345
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,441
He's not even bothering
to throw our tails anymore.

346
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,322
He's just living a boring old-man life
like he has nothing left to hide.

347
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,041
- And none of Fring's crew is talking?
- Not giving an inch.

348
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,884
You sweeten the pot enough?

349
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,362
Zero jail time and an
all-expense-paid trip to Maui?

350
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,809
Not that, but close.
Nobody wants to bite.

351
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,325
Christ!

352
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,286
They're either the most loyal crew in
history or someone's paying them off.

353
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,643
- You still checking bank records?
- No one living beyond their means.

354
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,327
Nine perps, all being represented
by one lawyer.

355
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,323
Not unusual in a case like this.

356
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,690
Yeah, this guy, what's his name?
Daniel Wachsberger?

357
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,970
He represents every one of these
douche bags except for Ehrmantraut.

358
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,963
Can we find out more
about the lawyer?

359
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,327
You want me to start
tailing a lawyer?

360
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,131
Like the shit ain't deep enough
for you already.

361
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,282
Ramey said we couldn't
follow Ehrmantraut.

362
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,528
He didn't say anything
about anybody else.

363
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,127
Do it.

364
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,684
You're the boss.

365
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,121
All right. Shall we get started?

366
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,410
Now, I know that most of this,
or all of this, is gonna be new to you.

367
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,451
But did you take chemistry
in high school?

368
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,931
Just basic?

369
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,720
No.

370
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,928
Okay. That's all right.

371
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,206
As we go, I'll be as detailed as
possible without being overwhelming.

372
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,925
Yes, sir.

373
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,082
Look, Todd, I don't need you
to be Antoine Lavoisier.

374
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,241
What I do need is your full effort
and attention.

375
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,641
Listen and apply yourself.

376
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:56,489
If you do that, then we just might
have a fighting chance here, okay?

377
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,363
- Okay.
- Okay.

378
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,286
Well, here we go.

379
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,645
Slowly. Steady.

380
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,085
The aluminium helps speed up
the delivery of hydrogen chloride.

381
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,367
Gently pour it in. Don't spill it.

382
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,601
<i>You're gonna like the little Schticky,
but you're gonna love the big Schticky.</i>

383
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,240
<i>For bigger messes
like dust bunnies...</i>

384
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,882
Now...

385
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,010
...the CO2 freezes the liquid...

386
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,242
...crystallising it...

387
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,728
...which gives us our finished
methamphetamine.

388
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,206
Now all that's left...

389
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,081
...is to break it up, weigh it,
and we're done.

390
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,407
Wow, this is...

391
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,723
This is complicated. It's gonna take me
a few more times to get a grasp on it.

392
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,606
Oh, yeah. It'll take
a few more times.

393
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,083
I do all right?

394
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,924
You did fine, Todd.

395
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,084
You applied yourself.
That's as much as I can ask.

396
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,321
Now all that's left,
I guess, is to talk money.

397
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,609
We can talk money
once I get this right.

398
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,324
Morning. Guess what I have.

399
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,206
Cake pops.
They're balls of cake on a stick.

400
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,451
Very nice. Thank you, Dan.

401
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,046
See? I put little faces on them.

402
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,490
Hey.

403
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,050
Hey.

404
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,368
All right.

405
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,923
I'm working with a new guy now.

406
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,847
And I think that it...

407
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,722
I think it could
possibly work out...

408
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,689
."because""

409
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,683
I'm trying, Hank. I really am.
I'm trying, but there's... There's...

410
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,527
I mean,
it's like I don't even exist to her.

411
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,809
Well, yeah. Yeah.

412
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,807
I mean, I know she's struggling.
I know, but I just don't know what to do.

413
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,002
I mean, what can I do?

414
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,208
Such a mess.

415
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,691
I mean, we-- Both of us...

416
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,362
...we just have screwed up so much.

417
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,924
I'm just...

418
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,801
I'm sorry. I don't--
Do you have any coffee?

419
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,122
- Maybe I can--
- Coffee? You bet. Yeah, you bet.

420
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,886
- What, you take cream, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

421
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,400
- All right. Here you go, buddy.
- Oh, thank you, Hank.

422
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,649
- Yeah.
- Look, I'm sorry to waste your time...

423
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,211
- ...with all this.
- No.

424
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,489
- It's, you know-- But it's-- You know.
- Yeah.

425
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,847
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

426
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,560
Hey, could you excuse me?

427
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,007
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

428
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,168
- Tell me something good.
- You tell me.

429
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,324
Sweated the guy for 14 hours.
That should be some kind of record.

430
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,403
Quit your bragging. What'd you get?

431
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,723
He's gonna do it. He's gonna flip.

432
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,366
He's willing to give us Ehrmantraut?

433
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,121
What are you wasting your time for?
Throw a net around that son of a bitch.

434
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,248
All right.

435
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,283
<i>- Yeah?
- Mike, hey, it's me.</i>

436
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,044
- Can you <i>talk?</i>
- I can.

437
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,363
<i>Great. Look, there's a small
situation with the money.</i>

438
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,729
<i>I don't wanna do this on the phone.
Are you available?</i>

439
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,769
I can come by in a few hours.

440
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,082
<i>That's not good for me.
Where are you now?</i>

441
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,322
I'm at the park
with my granddaughter.

442
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,885
<i>Where exactly?</i>

443
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,126
Palomita.

444
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,563
<i>Oh, you know what? I'm not far.
I'll come to you. You just hang tight.</i>

445
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,369
- Yeah?
- Mike, they're coming for you.

446
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,921
<i>- Right now. They're coming.
- Slow down, Walter. Who?</i>

447
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,004
<i>The DEA. The DEA--
Somebody ﬂipped.</i>

448
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,130
<i>They have some kind of
bank surveillance.</i>

449
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,805
<i>And something about some lawyer.</i>

450
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,646
<i>Someone is talking, Mike, and
they're coming for you right now--</i>

451
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,643
How could Mike use
that clown of a lawyer?

452
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,131
Dan Wachsberger.

453
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,529
He would've had better luck with the
law firm of Moe, Larry and Shemp.

454
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,445
Always consult with me
before using outside counsel.

455
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,241
All right, Saul, enough, please.
Instead of just sitting around here...

456
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,051
- ...what can we do?
- Besides pray that he gets away...

457
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,804
...I'm open to ideas.

458
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,923
Because if the DEA
catches up with him...

459
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,209
...and he flips, it's good night,
John-boy.

460
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,446
No. No way Mike would ever flip, okay?
No way.

461
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,809
Yeah, yeah. Never say never.

462
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,170
This is the second time the DEA
has confiscated his bankroll.

463
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,971
You know? Jesus,
fool me once, right?

464
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,610
Look, he won't flip.

465
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,249
But his nine guys will.

466
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,489
Hey. It's him.

467
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,328
Mike, I got you on speaker phone
with the brain trust.

468
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,371
- The <i>what?</i>
- The... Walt and Jesse are here.

469
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,490
<i>I don't want Walt and Jesse, Saul.
I want you. I need your help.</i>

470
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,604
- What do you need?
- I got a go-bag at the airport.

471
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,161
Passports, money,
but there are eyes everywhere.

472
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,845
I can't get close.

473
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,050
I need you to pick up that bag and
get it to me as soon as possible.

474
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,521
Do you know how thick
the crap storm is out there?

475
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,762
Told you not to use that lawyer.
He's a hack!

476
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,686
- Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.
- Hey, Mike, I can get it to you, all right?

477
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,367
- Just tell me what to do.
- No, <i>kid.</i> Not you.

478
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,682
I'm paying Saul.
He can do the job just fine.

479
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,764
Yeah, you're paying me,
and the DEA knows I represent you...

480
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,760
...so they're probably sitting on my car
right now, hoping I do something stupid.

481
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,491
Mike, I can do it, okay?
It's not a problem.

482
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,444
- No, Jesse.
- Jesus, I'll do it.

483
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,130
Besides, you're out, remember?

484
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,530
Mike, tell me where to get this bag.

485
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,129
Hello, Walter.

486
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,771
Before I hand this over,
I need something from you.

487
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,561
- And what's that?
- The names of your nine men.

488
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,681
Why? You're never gonna pay them off.
What's the point?

489
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,889
The point is, Mike, it affects me.

490
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,726
It affects Jesse too.
And we deserve to know.

491
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,851
The only thing left to do now
is leave town. You understand?

492
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,082
"Leave town."

493
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,165
Yeah, I just can't up and leave
like you, Mike.

494
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,563
I've got a family,
I've got people who depend on me.

495
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,404
Yeah.

496
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,803
Goodbye, Walter.

497
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,004
You're welcome!

498
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,842
I'm sorry, what?

499
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,207
I want those names, Mike.
You owe me that much.

500
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,805
I don't owe you a damn thing.

501
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,170
All of this, falling apart
like this, is on you.

502
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,768
Oh, that's some kind of logic
right there, Mike.

503
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,730
You screw up, get yourself
followed by the DEA...

504
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,281
...and now suddenly,
this is all my fault?

505
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,205
- Why don't you walk me through this?
- We had a good thing...

506
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,331
...you stupid son of a bitch!
We had Fring. We had a lab.

507
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,325
We had everything we needed,
and it all ran like clockwork.

508
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,648
- Oh, my God.
- You could've shut your mouth...

509
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,201
...cooked, and made as much money
as you ever needed.

510
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,643
It was perfect.
But, no, you just had to blow it up.

511
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,883
You and your pride and your ego!

512
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,883
You just had to be the man.

513
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,447
If you'd done your job,
known your place...

514
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,080
...we'd all be fine right now.

515
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,281
I just...

516
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,684
I just realised that Lydia has the names.
I can get them from her.

517
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,768
I'm sorry, Mike.

518
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,648
This... This whole thing
could've been avoided.

519
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,922
Shut the fuck up...

520
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,571
...and let me die in peace.
