1
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,355
- Save Shelly.
- Huh?

2
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,774
Save Shelly.

3
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,532
Why, who in the world
let Major Briggs loose, Leo?

4
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,576
It couldn't have been you, could it?

5
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,332
No, no. No punishment, Leo.

6
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,543
It's too late for that
to do us any harm.

7
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,422
And I have a new game for you.

8
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,816
Well, here's our contribution
to the Miss Twin Peaks gala buffet.

9
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,025
Mm.

10
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,654
And I fully expect to see one of you
up there in the winner's circle.

11
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,366
- Dream on, Norma.
- Don't be so sure.

12
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,576
This is the biggest day of the year
for us.

13
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,370
And we have to have somebody
up there

14
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,122
who really deserves this title.

15
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,540
Especially this year.

16
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,126
You mean Laura Palmer?

17
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,962
It would be a good day for healing.

18
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,674
I think we need more than a day.

19
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,260
So, Norma, are they gonna
honor you tonight

20
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,722
on your 20th anniversary
of winning Miss Twin Peaks?

21
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,348
Don't remind me.

22
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,310
Come on,
if you entered today, you'd win.

23
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,979
Look at you,
you're already working on the judge.

24
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,816
Well, since you mentioned it...

25
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,651
Who are you gonna vote for?

26
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,321
Maybe you could split your vote.

27
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,709
- Hi, Daddy.
- Audrey.

28
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,837
The most intelligent face
that I've seen all day.

29
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,508
You make the rest of us
look like primates.

30
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,218
What's with all the books?

31
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,347
Ah, yes, the Koran,

32
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,433
the Bhagavad-Gita, the Talmud,

33
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,686
the Bible, Old and New Testaments,

34
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,730
the Tao Te Ching.

35
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:02,527
Audrey, I hold in my hands
those holy books

36
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,863
which constitute
the fundamental framework

37
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,532
of humanity's
philosophy of good.

38
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,120
Somewhere in here
are the answers that I seek.

39
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:17,959
And I intend to read them
from cover to cover, until I find...

40
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,544
Aw.

41
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,215
Listen to me prattling on.

42
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,134
It's Jack, isn't it?

43
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,888
It's only been a day.

44
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,392
I hope it doesn't hurt this much
in a week.

45
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,940
Honey, may I give you
a piece of ageless wisdom

46
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,193
culled from these volumes?

47
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,696
Time heals all wounds.

48
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,117
I know how it feels.

49
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,077
Believe me.

50
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,706
We barely had time
to know each other.

51
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,753
But the time that you had
was highly concentrated.

52
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,216
It's the concentrate
they make concentrate from.

53
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,764
I'm afraid I'll never see him again.

54
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,600
Jack is a man of his word.

55
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:20,105
And if he said that he'd be back,
then he will be back.

56
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,858
I promise you.

57
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:27,362
Daddy, you can't promise me,
but thanks for wanting to.

58
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,825
I actually came here
to update you on my trip to Seattle.

59
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,537
Right. Update away.

60
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,789
Okay.

61
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,667
The Packards are using
Twin Peaks Savings and Loan

62
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,128
to funnel cash
to the Ghostwood project.

63
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,590
But the bank is keeping
a very low profile.

64
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:50,093
It seems they don't want
any bad publicity.

65
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,679
Oh, they don't?

66
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,601
Well, bad publicity
is exactly what they're gonna get.

67
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,228
Audrey, have you given
any more thought

68
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,482
to, uh, the Miss Twin Peaks
Pageant?

69
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,776
Daddy...

70
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,156
From the bottom of my heart,

71
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,701
I don't wanna be
the town bathing beauty.

72
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,911
I understand.

73
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:21,291
But Miss Twin Peaks
is the ultimate local forum.

74
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,543
Audrey.

75
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,590
It would truly be inspirational

76
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,927
to have a winner
with a political sensibility

77
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,429
that extends
beyond makeup strategies

78
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:39,476
and, uh, recipes for cherry pie, huh?

79
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,728
Now, as you know,

80
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,690
each contestant gives a speech
to the, uh, assembled town.

81
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,736
This year's theme concerns
our immediate environment.

82
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,490
And what we must do to preserve it.

83
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,868
I know there's another way to do this,
Daddy.

84
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,830
Audrey, make the speech.

85
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,084
Help stop Ghostwood.

86
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:08,129
And take us to a better day.

87
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,221
Has he taken his eyes off it yet?

88
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,223
Not today.

89
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,933
And before you ask,

90
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,603
we still got people out
combing the woods for Major Briggs.

91
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:27,023
Harry, considering their mutual
connection to Project Blue Book,

92
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,317
I believe that Windom Earle
has targeted the major.

93
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,445
- What for?
- Interesting.

94
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,075
I don't know.

95
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,288
But with your permission,
I'd like to speak out loud.

96
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,457
Windom Earle has been
seeking access to the Black Lodge

97
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,710
as far back as 1965.

98
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,503
This chess game may involve

99
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,880
more pieces
than we've begun to imagine.

100
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,133
Then of course,
there's the mysterious circumstances

101
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,843
surrounding Josie's death
to consider.

102
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,470
What about them?
Consider them how?

103
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,850
When she died... I'm sorry
I didn't mention this before, Harry,

104
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,019
but I had to take into account
your mental state.

105
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,313
What is it?

106
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,399
She was trembling with fear.

107
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,861
I would go as far as to say
quaking like an animal.

108
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,489
I might venture a guess to say
that it was the fear that killed her.

109
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,199
At the moment of her death...

110
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,703
...I saw Bob.

111
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,040
As if he had slipped in
through some crevice in time.

112
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,083
Upon reflection, I believe
there's a connection

113
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,044
between his appearance
and Josie's fear.

114
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,587
As if he was attracted to it.

115
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,340
Feeding off it somehow.

116
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,260
You see a connection
between Bob and the Black Lodge?

117
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,722
Harry,
I think it's where he comes from.

118
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,933
I think that the Black Lodge
is what you have referred to in the past

119
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,853
as "the evil in these woods."

120
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,272
If Windom Earle is seeking access
to that,

121
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,609
it is imperative that we find our way in
before he does.

122
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,153
There's a source of great power there,
Harry.

123
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,366
Far beyond our ability
to comprehend.

124
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,494
Eureka!

125
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,582
Dale, I could kiss
your pointy little head.

126
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,251
Mwah. Ha, ha.

127
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,962
It's fear.

128
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,256
It's fear, Leo. That's the key.

129
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,134
My favorite emotional state.

130
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:22,097
And all this time,
it's been staring me right in the kisser.

131
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:26,017
Leo, it's marvelous, a perfect fit.

132
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,812
These night creatures that hover
on the edge of our nightmares

133
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,232
are drawn to us
when we radiate fear.

134
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,150
It's their bread and butter.

135
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,319
A perfect symbiosis.

136
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:40,532
Oh, nature,
perfect in design and aspects.

137
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,118
You do not disappoint!

138
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,412
Leo, look lively.

139
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,164
Victory is at hand.

140
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,168
We know where the entrance is.
We know when the lock appears.

141
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:57,465
Now we hold the key in our hands.

142
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,221
Forgive my hasty departure,
dear one.

143
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:08,143
The time has come
to gather my beloved queen

144
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,646
and embark
upon our dark honeymoon.

145
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,527
I haven't been this excited
since I punctured Caroline's aorta.

146
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:23,533
Leo, we must share
a final sentiment.

147
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,078
During our time together
in this verdant bower,

148
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:32,125
I must confess, I've developed
something of a fondness for you.

149
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:36,337
Sounding board, companion,

150
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,549
ever obedient and faithful.

151
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,844
An overall A for effort, Leo.

152
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:47,140
But I'm still a trifle miffed
at your release of Major Briggs.

153
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:53,396
But then, you'll have plenty of time
to reflect upon that, won't you?

154
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,276
Goodbye, Leo.

155
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,570
And good luck.

156
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:49,661
One and two and three, step four.

157
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,164
And one and two...
Let the mood carry you.

158
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,708
Don't be afraid of your vulnerability.
Show me more leg.

159
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,753
What kind of a dance
is this supposed to be, Mr. Pinkle?

160
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,465
It's a dance of nature, my friend.

161
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,468
It's a celebration.
All right, girls.

162
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:09,472
Now, turn around
and bend forward

163
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,350
like a sapling.
A sapling in the wind.

164
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:17,272
That's it. A little bit more, and hold it.

165
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,942
What exactly are we celebrating
with us all bending over like this?

166
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,072
Don't ever question the vision
of your choreographer!

167
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,200
You are but a petal on my rose.

168
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,912
Now, please, people.
On the count of one.

169
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,166
One and two and three and four.

170
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,793
And one and two

171
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,255
- and three and four...
- I love a chorus line. Ha, ha.

172
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,465
If we could just focus here
for a second.

173
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,509
I've gotta get back to the diner.

174
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:51,180
Now, what qualities do we think
best exemplify Miss Twin Peaks?

175
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:55,643
Um, beauty and power.

176
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,645
That's the way I like them.

177
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,941
Poise and, God help us,
a sophistication

178
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,152
and breeding.

179
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,572
Well, I think a major factor
should be originality.

180
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,782
Well, wouldn't that fall under talent?

181
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,160
It's always nice when it does. Ha, ha.

182
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:16,289
Personally,
I've always been big on style.

183
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,249
I think this is enough
for me to work with,

184
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,502
so I'm gonna go back
and work up the scoresheets,

185
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,630
- and I'll see you tonight.
Mm-hm.

186
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,590
- Terrific.
- Bye.

187
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,467
And three and four.

188
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,844
Okay, that's a break, team.

189
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,097
Hi, Dick. We're on break.

190
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,892
Hi, Lana.

191
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,145
Would you mind helping me
find something in the storage room?

192
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,481
- Storage room?
Mm-hm.

193
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,525
We're missing
a very important prop.

194
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,277
Come on.

195
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,960
I'm having trouble.

196
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,337
Well, just flick it.

197
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:10,134
Now, what exactly
did you need to find?

198
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,641
- Lana?
- Oh, did I do that?

199
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,644
What are you looking for?

200
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:24,816
Well, now, I don't know
the exact technical name for it, but...

201
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:31,614
Does anything...?
Does anything in here look like it?

202
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,911
Oh, I think this might be it.

203
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:42,041
Oh, by George, I think you've got it.

204
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,304
Diane, it's 1:17 p.m.
I have just concluded

205
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,473
my second meditation of the day
in lieu of sleep.

206
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,935
And I feel completely refreshed
and struck again by the realization

207
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,271
that all of us on this great big
planet Earth

208
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,481
live at only a fraction
of our potential.

209
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,527
We are working round the clock
on the cave petroglyph.

210
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,989
I am certain that the answers lie
in this mysterious etching.

211
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,782
I am also convinced
that Windom Earle

212
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,076
is searching for exactly
the same thing as we are

213
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,454
for diametrically opposite reasons.

214
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:23,041
If I'm correct in my assumptions
about the power of this unholy place,

215
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,877
God help us if he gets there first.

216
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,004
Diane, at this particular juncture,

217
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,883
I would like to make specific mention
of Annie Blackburn.

218
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,635
She is a completely original
human being.

219
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,347
Her responses,
as pure as those of a child.

220
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,768
I must be honest, I haven't felt this way
about a woman since Caroline.

221
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,228
It has taken meeting Annie
for me to realize

222
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,065
how gray my life has been
since Caroline's death.

223
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,692
How cold and solitary.

224
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,196
Although occasionally,

225
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,490
there is something to be said
for solitude.

226
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,501
Annie Blackburn,
you have almost perfect timing.

227
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,420
That's not
what our choreographer says.

228
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,882
What can I do for you?

229
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,052
Well, I need to, uh, give a speech
in six hours.

230
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,762
I haven't written a word,

231
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,306
and, uh, I don't have any idea
what I wanna say.

232
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,058
I'm in a complete
sweaty-palmed panic,

233
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,019
and I need to talk to someone,
namely you.

234
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,479
What's your topic?

235
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,065
What you can do
to save our local forests.

236
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,235
I just don't wanna stand up there
like some deranged Barbie doll,

237
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,196
saying things like,
"Make sure your campfires are out,

238
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,948
kind of like my brain."

239
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,409
- You're terrified of public speaking.
- Yes. Ha, ha.

240
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,496
All right, well...

241
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,750
...our forests need saving because
of the way people regard them.

242
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,669
Expendable.

243
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,213
If the Ghostwood development
cost thousands of lives,

244
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,258
do you think it would have
a chance of going forward?

245
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,136
Well, trees aren't the same
as people.

246
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,304
But they are alive.

247
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:05,309
Your forest is beautiful
and peaceful.

248
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,813
Part of it's been damaged.

249
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,441
I've tried to replant,
but nothing's taken root.

250
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,070
Every forest has its shadow.

251
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,658
I can see half my life's history
in your face,

252
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,119
and I'm not sure that I want to.

253
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,297
I don't wanna talk about trees
anymore.

254
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,851
All I know is,
I wanna make love with you.

255
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:14,837
And this is me with last year's
regional champion from Yakima.

256
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,424
He was cute, but a little slow. Next.

257
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,596
Oh, and this is me
with Brock Farmington,

258
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,265
triple-A champion from Spokane.

259
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,809
Superior upper-body strength,

260
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:33,272
and quads like bridge supports.

261
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:37,443
I pinned him in a minute five.

262
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,153
Next.

263
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:45,409
Oh, this is me
with all the stuff I won.

264
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,330
- That's nice.
- Way to go.

265
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,667
Thank you, Nadine.

266
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,336
Well, ahem, now,

267
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,423
I suppose all of you are wondering
just why we've gathered here today.

268
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:04,303
See, I learned that, uh, when a couple
is contemplating div...

269
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,139
Uh... Uh... Uh, breaking up,

270
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:12,645
well, um, uh, sometimes it's easier
to talk about our feelings, uh,

271
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,605
when we're around other people.

272
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:20,319
So, uh, Nadine,
maybe you'd like to begin.

273
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,154
Okay.

274
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,157
Um, well, I guess it all started

275
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:29,453
when I noticed Mike's buns
in the hall at school.

276
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,706
Yes, um,

277
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,792
well, how are you feeling now?

278
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,714
Well, a little guilty, I guess.

279
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:46,262
I mean, Mike and I are hot.

280
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,431
And Miss Twin Peaks is tonight,

281
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:52,810
and Mr. Pinkle thinks
I'm a show-business natural.

282
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:58,232
Well, I mean, because I'm so happy,

283
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,609
I worry about Ed being sad.

284
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:07,491
Ed, is there something
that you'd like to tell Nadine?

285
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,786
Nadine...

286
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,292
...Norma and I
plan on getting married.

287
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,007
Really?

288
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,053
Well, that's wonderful, Eddie,

289
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,514
because Mike and me
are getting married too.

290
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,531
Which way is the castle?

291
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,840
- I waited for you.
- Thanks, Harry.

292
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,925
Not that he's too talkative.

293
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,595
He checks out okay physically.
Doc ran some blood tests.

294
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,515
He's been shot full of haloperidol.

295
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,851
Right.

296
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,104
Garland?

297
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,731
Did Windom Earle do this to you?

298
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,692
Garland?

299
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,778
Odd name.

300
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,573
Judy Garland?

301
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,741
Was it Windom Earle?

302
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,206
It was God, I suppose.

303
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,293
Garland, where did he take you?

304
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,044
The woods?

305
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,380
Can you be more specific?

306
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,925
They were lovely.

307
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:36,557
Dark. The king of Romania
was unable to attend.

308
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,982
Harry, this is gonna take some time.

309
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,360
- How much time we got?
- Not enough.

310
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,906
Let's leave him here with us.
Maybe something will bubble up.

311
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,912
Harry, we're in trouble.

312
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,955
If the door to the Black Lodge
does exist,

313
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,416
it probably exists at a point in time.

314
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,084
Now, an object, such as a door,

315
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,712
normally exists at a point
in time and space.

316
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,422
By way of contrast,

317
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,966
a shooting star normally exists
at a point in time

318
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,593
over a continuum of space.

319
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,013
But taken from the star's point of view,
it's a completely different experience.

320
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,515
You just lost me.

321
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,935
If we're not at the right place
at exactly the right time,

322
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,103
we won't find our way in.

323
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,147
Sheriff?

324
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,317
Could the Four-H Club
have anything to do with all of this?

325
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,653
Doubtful, Andy.

326
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,077
This has to be the last box.
Look at it.

327
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,162
I can't take any more of this.

328
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,623
Boxes inside boxes.

329
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,125
Whatever is in that
better be worth a fortune.

330
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,753
Maybe it's not a box at all.

331
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,298
Maybe it's just a block
of stainless steel.

332
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,760
- Eckhardt's last little joke.
- It'd be a good one.

333
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:59,181
Let's channel
some of that high wit into the job.

334
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,183
Again.

335
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,186
I can't believe a little crumb like that

336
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:08,190
can stand up to
this Cram Jack all-duty vise.

337
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,904
On three. One, two and three!

338
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,659
I'm sorry, Andrew.
That was my fault.

339
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,501
Dumb boxes!

340
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,802
Andrew!

341
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,022
Darn boxes.

342
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,696
Nice shooting, Andrew.

343
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,240
Look at that.

344
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,118
A key!

345
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:08,959
And where there's a key,
there's a lock.

346
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,087
It should be kept safe.

347
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:16,550
Yes, in plain sight.

348
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,846
You two don't trust each other?

349
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,682
Of course we do.

350
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,935
Like brother, like sister.

351
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,898
How about here?

352
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,735
In the cake saver.

353
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,738
In plain sight.

354
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:43,118
- So we have a key.
- Yes, we do.

355
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,965
You look truly beautiful.

356
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,009
Read us your speech.

357
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,013
I'd rather talk about the truth
right now.

358
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,266
What truth is that?

359
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,144
I know something's going on
with you and Benjamin Horne,

360
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,562
and I wanna know what it is.

361
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,065
Donna,
don't talk to your mother like that.

362
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:16,860
You know, I'm really tired of you
talking to me like I'm a child.

363
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,655
I wanna know what's going on.

364
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,909
Donna, I understand your feeling.

365
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,370
But there are some things
you just have to trust.

366
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,289
You're young
and you don't know all the limitations.

367
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,166
I know the limitations of lying.

368
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,168
I know that you raised me
to tell the truth.

369
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,130
I expect the same from you.

370
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,592
If you're not gonna tell me
what I need to know,

371
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,219
I'll find out from Benjamin Horne.

372
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,555
- No.
- Then tell me.

373
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,939
All right, this is your choice,
not mine.

374
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,024
Donna.

375
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,485
Donna!

376
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,546
By heavens.

377
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,591
Andy, take a look at this.

378
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,426
What you mistook
for the Four-H Club,

379
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,345
the four and the H,
are actually astrological symbols.

380
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,223
- You mean, like planets?
- Why, yes, Andy.

381
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,142
They stand for Jupiter and Saturn.

382
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,144
Some of the others
represent planets as well,

383
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:36,190
but this particular part of the puzzle
pertains to a precise planetary position.

384
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,651
- Jupiter and Saturn in conjunction.
- What's that supposed to mean?

385
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,071
Well, historically, Harry,
when Jupiter and Saturn are conjunct,

386
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,991
there are enormous shifts
in power and fortune.

387
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,993
Jupiter being expansive
in its influence,

388
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,453
Saturn, contractive.

389
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,624
Conjunction suggests a state
of intensification, concentration.

390
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,002
What this indicates to me
is the potential for explosive change,

391
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,797
- good and bad.
- So when's the next conjunction?

392
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,257
Well, now, let's see.

393
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,510
According to the ephemeris...

394
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:09,056
...the next conjunction is due
January to June.

395
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,518
My God, Harry.

396
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,019
The door to the lodge.

397
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,064
That's when it's open.
That's what the puzzle is telling us.

398
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,650
It's telling us
when it's gonna be open.

399
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,861
Protect the queen.

400
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,865
If it's telling us when,
then it must also tell us where.

401
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:31,912
Fear and love open the doors.

402
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,498
What's he saying?

403
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:39,419
He said,
"Fear and love open the doors."

404
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,507
Two doors, two lodges.

405
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,509
Fear opens one, the black.

406
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,719
- Love, the other.
- What's that mean?

407
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,763
I don't know exactly.
It just came to me.

408
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,141
How does the queen...?

409
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,311
- Of course, the queen.
- Of Romania?

410
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,565
No. The chess game's final piece.
Harry, follow my logic.

411
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,901
- If Windom Earle takes the queen...
- Game's not over till he takes the king.

412
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,571
That depends. Maybe he takes her
to the doorway when it opens.

413
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,823
- Which queen?
- Agent Cooper.

414
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,157
Just a minute, Andy.

415
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:12,619
The queen. The queen.
The crown. The queen.

416
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,746
- Harry, the queen.
- Agent Cooper?

417
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,206
Andy, please.

418
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,585
Harry, Miss Twin Peaks.

419
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,504
- Holy smokes, that's it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

420
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,464
Agent Cooper, please.

421
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,303
Andy.

422
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,935
Coop, the plant's been bugged.

423
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,605
This bonsai isn't from Josie, Harry.

424
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,357
This bonsai's from Windom Earle.

425
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,693
He's way ahead of us,

426
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,237
and we've been working for him
from the beginning.

427
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,489
- What time does that contest start?
- Any minute.

428
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,241
Let's go.

429
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,870
Agent Cooper. Agent Cooper!

430
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,358
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

431
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,777
I hope you've had a good weekend.

432
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,655
And welcome
to the Miss Twin Peaks Pageant,

433
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,993
in which one of these lovely
and talented young citizens

434
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,538
will soon be crowned
Miss Twin Peaks.

435
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,625
And now, commencing
our talent section of the show,

436
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,502
Lucy Moran.

437
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,273
Come on.

438
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,119
Small town, man.

439
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,473
So, what,
did you bring your whole family?

440
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:49,688
We're pulling in deputies from all over
to surround the place.

441
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,189
They should be here any time.

442
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,526
Harry, it is essential whoever wins
this contest receive 24-hour guard,

443
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,444
house security, I want the works.

444
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,988
As soon as she's announced.

445
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:01,324
Our next entry
is Lana Budding-Milford,

446
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,786
who will perform a dance of, uh...

447
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,582
...contortionistic jazz exotica.

448
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,209
- Lana?
- Agent Coop...

449
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:16,816
There, my friend, is a real artist.

450
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,251
There is only one way to save a forest,
an idea, or anything of value.

451
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,754
And that is by refusing to stand by
and watch it die.

452
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,591
There is a law of nature,
which is more fundamental to life

453
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,302
than the laws of man.

454
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,180
And when something you care about
is in danger,

455
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,057
you must fight to save it

456
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,810
or lose it forever.

457
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,229
Thank you.

458
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,818
Thank you, Audrey Horne.

459
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,737
Now a brief musical interlude.

460
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,198
Thanks, Daddy.

461
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,409
I'm gonna go out there.

462
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:20,046
I wanna know what's going on
with you and my mother.

463
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,382
Donna.

464
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,217
Uh...

465
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,096
I, uh, think the wisest course
would be,

466
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,182
first of all, just to get together
and talk about this.

467
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,642
I don't think so.

468
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:37,397
Donna, I really don't think
this is the time or the place.

469
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,108
Old pictures,
Horne bearer bonds in the attic,

470
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,652
love letters to my mom.

471
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,614
I want to tell the truth.
I want to do the right thing.

472
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,159
A birth certificate
with no father's name on it.

473
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,119
What the hell's going on here,
Mr. Horne?

474
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,289
Why won't anyone tell me the truth?

475
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,548
Donna.

476
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,679
Your mother and I...

477
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,311
You're my father?

478
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,191
Donna.

479
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,651
And to illustrate my point,

480
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,196
I'd like to quote these words
from Chief Seattle,

481
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,615
leader of the Suquamish tribe:

482
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,951
"Your dead are soon forgotten
and never return.

483
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,163
Our dead never forget the beautiful
world that gave them being.

484
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,248
They still love its verdant valleys,

485
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,502
its murmuring rivers,
its majestic mountains.

486
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,421
When the last red man has vanished
from this earth,

487
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,549
these forests and shores
will still hold their spirits."

488
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,677
For the Indians love the earth

489
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,889
as a newborn loves
its mother's heartbeat.

490
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,600
Why have we all lost touch
with this beauty?

491
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,812
Maybe saving a forest starts
with preserving some of the feelings

492
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,022
that die inside us every day.

493
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,316
Those parts of ourselves
that we deny.

494
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,861
For if we cannot respect
that interior land,

495
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,240
then neither can we respect
the land we walk.

496
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,368
So let us, in walking gently
upon the earth,

497
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,495
leave behind a simple legacy.

498
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,997
That we're new warriors,

499
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,626
mystic warriors who love the earth

500
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,336
and tried to save it.

501
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,214
Thank you very much.

502
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,183
Thanks to all our contestants.

503
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:41,980
Balloting will now commence,
and we will then announce our winner.

504
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,402
Have you both forgotten
what day this is?

505
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,071
Miss Twin Peaks Day?

506
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:54,659
Today is the day
my unborn child receives a dad.

507
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,911
It was right on the tip of my tongue.

508
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,247
I have decided

509
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:04,711
that regardless of which individual
is biologically responsible,

510
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,131
that I want Andy to be the father
of my child.

511
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,175
Really?

512
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:15,013
I'm sorry, Dick, but I just have to do
what's best for little what's-his-name.

513
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,848
Oh, no, not at all. A sound choice.

514
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,684
Heartiest congratulations,
dearest Andrew.

515
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:24,230
Now, if you'll both excuse me,
I do have a vote to cast myself.

516
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,652
Here's to the children. Ha, ha.

517
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,657
Don't sound so disappointed.

518
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,951
My God, Lucy.

519
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,289
I'm so honored
you made this decision.

520
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:46,711
And I promise I'll be a great father.

521
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,757
But right now

522
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,177
I've got to find Agent Cooper.

523
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,183
Men.

524
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,899
It is time
to make the announcement.

525
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,445
The winner of the contest

526
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,448
and our new Miss Twin Peaks is...

527
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,869
...Annie Blackburn.

528
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,640
Ladies and gentlemen,
your new Miss Twin Peaks!

529
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,859
This is an outrage.

530
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:55,697
She's been living in this town
about 15 minutes.

531
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,991
And what the hell got into you?

532
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,410
She gave a beautiful speech.

533
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,120
Inherent in her message were words

534
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:05,331
even the most craven of us
can ill afford to ignore.

535
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,602
What's happening?

536
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:38,197
Everybody, please,
please, stay calm.

537
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,347
Good Lord.

538
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,892
This way.

539
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:33,836
Settle down. Everybody
settle down. Don't panic! This way.

540
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,758
- I will help you.
- Aah!

541
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,143
Annie?

542
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,901
Annie?

543
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,820
- Harry.
- What?

544
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,405
- He took Annie.
- What?

545
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,156
He got Annie.

546
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:05,702
Bastard. He won't get half a mile
from here. We'll get him.

547
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,414
Agent Cooper,
I've been looking all over for you.

548
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,667
Andy, they're gonna need you
outside.

549
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,085
This is important.

550
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:17,505
That cave painting in the office,
I finally figured it out.

551
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,800
- What?
- I knew I'd seen it someplace before.

552
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,635
I know where it's telling us to go.

553
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,554
It's not a puzzle at all.

554
00:45:24,722 --> 00:46:23,029
It's a map.
