00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,533
- Look at all this damn water.
- Don't drink that.

6
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,994
Ain't no telling
if it's gonna be poison.

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,729

Well, exactly what I expected.

13
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,886
He hasn't said a word since
we told him it was going back.

14
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,640
I, um, spoke to the dealership,
they didn't wanna take it.

15
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,391
What?

16
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,727
It's in perfect condition.

17
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,855
It's got 1 7 miles on the odometer.
I know.

18
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:32,193
I spent an hour sweet-talking
the manager down to
a restocking fee.

19
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,403
Eight hundred dollars.

20
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,073
Eight hundred dollars?
For two days?

21
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,660
Well, the law says they don't
have to take it back at all.

22
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:45,039
All right, here's the registration,
the window sticker, the receipt.

23
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,583
Oh, make sure you talk
to the general manager.

24
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,502
His name is Glenn.

25
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,087
Glenn.

26
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,966

And please just don't--

I need a cab.

64
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,430
Yes, thank you. The name is White.

65
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:37,354
Uh, I'm at the Pavilion parking lot
on University.

66
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,983
Oh, yes, that's right.
Just south of the airport.

67
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,278
Oh, that would be great,
thank you. Oh...

68
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,073
How long do you think
that would take?

69
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,496
No, I'm sure he'll see me.

70
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,164
Thank you.

71
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,461
Contrition?

72
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,922
Hey, there is total contrition here.

73
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,925
There's mountains of contrition.

74
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,470
"Fan-tan-tastic."
I will messenger them
over right away.

75
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:14,600
Oh, and, ahem, about that
other thing unrelated,
yes, l can get you in.

76
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,062
But l gotta warn you,
the eighth hole is murder.

77
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,107
Oh, yeah. You wanna
make it interesting?

78
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,150
Great. Tee time
is 7 a.m. sharp.

79
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,402
Prepare to have your ass
handed to you.

80
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,822
Okay. Bye.

81
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,616
He was headed for
destruction of property.

82
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:35,955
Since it's your property,
I sweated him down to
misdemeanor trash burning.

83
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,251
Now, the only thing is
it's not gonna be free.

84
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,838
There's a 5 grand fine,
600 for towing and disposal,

85
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,132
3 grand to steam-clean
the blacktop.

86
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,552
So bottom line,
your little joyride is
gonna set you back

87
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,512
about 52,000 bucks.

88
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,056
So was it worth it?

89
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,227
I don't need
to hear the blow-by-blow.
Just tell me it's done.

90
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,479
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did l wake you?

91
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,399
I caught this thing
before it got into the system.

92
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,277
Your record stays clean,
the wife never finds out.

93
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:10,489
I've been working magic here.
I could at least get an "attaboy."

94
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,244
Fine. Rebel without a cause, give.

95
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,177
What is it? Fring?

96
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,263
He will see me dead.

97
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,849
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

98
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:41,437
All that's left is to wait.

99
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,482
And we're sure
about this.

100
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,652
Because Pinkman says
he needs you too much.

101
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,113
"Pinkman says." Heh.

102
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,495
"Pinkman says."

103
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,127
Unless...

104
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,215
you could help me find
a third party.

105
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,592
What third party?

106
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,387
Someone who can ameliorate
the situation.

107
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,599
Let's ditch the thesaurus,
all right?

108
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,851
You talking about
a hit man?

109
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,437
Assuming that's still
what they're called.

110
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,522
Bzzt! Wrong answer.

111
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,692
That's what the kids
call "epic fail."

112
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,238
All l would need is
a phone number.
I'd do the rest.

113
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,074
Saul, there'd be
a finder's fee.

114
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,492
A big one.

115
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:40,246
If you held my feet to the fire,
I could come up with names.

116
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,332
One or two guys west of
the Rockies who do this work.

117
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,417
But guess what. These guys,

118
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,295
they know Mike
and Mike knows them.

119
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,965
Mike knows everyone
who does this?

120
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,133
Who do you think gave me
their names?

121
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,054
All right. Okay, plan B.
Look, we go outside my network.

122
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,723
Craigslist. Soldier of Fortune.

123
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,977
Let's say we get lucky.
I mean, incredibly lucky,

124
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,145
and find a guy who's not a cop

125
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,399
or some kind
of survivalist nut-job wannabe.

126
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,819
You gotta ask yourself:
How good is good enough?

127
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:15,948
Whatever goombah we buy
is gonna come head-to-head
with Mike.

128
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,491
And Gus Fring?

129
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:22,079
Hey, just winging that guy
is not gonna "ameliorate"
your situation.

130
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,039
Not by a damn sight.

131
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,543
I've tried to solve this,
but l can't get anywhere
near him.

132
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,961
You can't get near him?

133
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,422
Why don't you ask your partner?

134
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,012
Yeah, I saw him.

135
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,598
And you tell Saul
before you tell me?

136
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,435
Look, he's my lawyer,
same as yours.

137
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,646
Every time l go over there,
Saul hassles me about Mike.

138
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,816
He's still scared the dude's
gonna come break his legs.

139
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,694
So I give him the latest.

140
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,821
What happened exactly?

141
00:10:56,323 --> 00:11:02,995
I was at a diner with Mike
and he just shows up.

142
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,664
They send me outside
and the two of them talk.

143
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,416
That's it.

144
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,712
So this is, like,
a regular thing?

145
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,549
How close were you
to him?

146
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:16,925
Close.

147
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,429
I mean, closer than
you and me right now.

148
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,308
Did he speak to you?

149
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,315
It was over in 1 0 seconds.

150
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,400
Would you just answer?

151
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,945
He said he sees things
in people.

152
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,366
What things?

153
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,950
What people?

154
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,202
Me.

155
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,747
He said he sees something in me.

156
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:56,131
A month ago,
Gus was trying to kill both of us.

157
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:01,595
And now he pulls you out of the lab
and employs you as what?

158
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,472
An assistant gunman?

159
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,474
A tough guy?

160
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,602
Does that make any sense to you?

161
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,399
He says he sees
something in you.

162
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,361
What kind of game is he playing?

163
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,114
Does he think you're that naive?

164
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,619
He can't truly think
that you'd forget--

165
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,833
Well, let alone Gale,
let alone Victor,

166
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,169
and all the horror
that goes along with all of that.

167
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,839
What about this girlfriend of yours

168
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,174
and her little brother?

169
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,428
I mean, the man looked you
straight in the eye

170
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:48,725
and told you, "No more children."
But that very night, that little boy,

171
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,227
he just--

172
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,312
He winds up...

173
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,900
Gus can't possibly think
that you'd forget that.

174
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,280
Okay.
All l'm just saying is that

175
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,993
is it possible that he would think
that you're that weak-willed?

176
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,079
Drop the sales pitch.

177
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,081
I'll do it.

178
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,126
You'll do what?

179
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,963
I'll kill him.

180
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,924

Piña colada?
More like stale bubblegum.

184
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:49,244
Does anyone want their car
to smell like the bottom
of a 6th-grader's desk?

185
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,954
Okay. Hemp? Really?

186
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,708
I know. But you know what they say.
"The customer is always right."

187
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,712
Speaking of customer,
it's not too late to have
a grand opening.

188
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,050
I was thinking huge party, balloons,
bouncy house for the kids.

189
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,260
You know, make a splash,
get on TV.

190
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,348
Let people know they won't
face the eyebrows of doom
when they come in.

191
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,894
Marie, how's Hank doing?

192
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,396
You know what?
He's doing better.

193
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,441
Is he?
Yeah. He, uh--

194
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:25,781
Lately, his mood's improved
and he's like a maniac with his PT.

195
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:26,990
That's fantastic.

196
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:31,161
Yeah, don't get me wrong,
he's got a long way to go,
but he--

197
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,121
Yeah.
Oh, hey.

198
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,834
Hey. Hi, Walt. It's good to see you.
Hey. You too.

199
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,380
Hey, your cashier here
is quite the salesperson.

200
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,259
She just talked me into
something called the
Orbital Paste Wax Buff.

201
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,595
Oh, yeah, it's very important
to maintain your clear coat.

202
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,264
Boy, once that's goes...

203
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,848
Oh, yeah.

204
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,892
Um, hi.

205
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,144
Hi.

00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,981

207
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:04,069
Bogdan was averaging 1 9 cars
during rush hour,

208
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,990
and we are already up to 22.
Twenty-two actual cars.

209
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:13,245
Last night I deposited $3800.

210
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,373
Jesus.

211
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,041
How much is that?

212
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,421
Two hundred seventy-four
thousand dollars, give or take.

213
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,674
Give or take?
Yeah.

214
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,176
I haven't counted it.

215
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,012
Wait.

216
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,806
Two hundred
and seventy-four--

217
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,850
And this is how often?

218
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,768
Every two weeks.

219
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,814
Thursdays good for a drop-off?

220
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,649
But, Walt,

221
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:49,281
are you telling me
you make $7,125,000 a year?

222
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,870
Seven and a half even,
before expenses.

223
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,372
But l can't--

224
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,125
That-- This is too much.

225
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,461
So it's more than you thought,

226
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,380
and this is somehow bad news?

227
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,883
No, that's not the point.

228
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,595
I mean, there's no car wash
in the world

229
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,847
that could do
this kind of business.

230
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:18,226
I mean, this is nine months'
work here, minimum.

231
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,021
Seven million?
That could take years.

232
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,191
So set some aside.
Save it for a rainy day.

233
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,110
Save it?
Where? Save it where?

234
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,698
I can't go to the bank with it.
I sure can't leave it here.

235
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,409
Oh.
Oy.

236
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,536
Wait a minute.

237
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,205
Is this all 50s?

238
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:42,584
Who pays for a car wash with a 50?
Skyler, I didn't ask you to do this.

239
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,962
I was under the impression
that you had this under control.

240
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,132
I just didn't expect
this amount of money.

241
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,554
The 50s are gonna be a problem.
That's what this is, problem solving.

242
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,973
This is a simple division
of labor.

243
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,310
I bring money. You launder money.
This is what you wanted.

244
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,854
I never wanted any of this.

245
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,898
I've gotta go.

246
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,818
If you want out,
just say that you want out.

247
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,956
Okay, then.

248
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,742
You're telling me
you made this in the lab?

249
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,786
Why not?

250
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:45,248
Making it in his own lab
seemed appropriate.

251
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,042
There's not much of it.

252
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,211
We had more for Tuco.

253
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,046
It's enough.

254
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,048
This is still the best way.

255
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,593
You go after him with a gun,
you'll never get out of it alive.

256
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,345
But with this,

257
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,764
you slip it into his food or drink.

258
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,225
There shouldn't be
any taste or smell.

259
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,645
Thirty-six hours later: "poof."

260
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,525
A man his age,
working as hard as he does,

261
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,194
no one will be surprised.

262
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,115
What about Mike?

263
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,744
Mike can have his suspicions,
but that's all they'll be.

264
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:27,541
Please, one homicidal
maniac at a time.

265
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,261
I don't know when
I'm gonna see Gus again.

266
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,514
I mean, if ever.

267
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,476
Keep it with you.

268
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,563
When you have the opportunity,

269
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,523
be ready.

270
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,152
What if they search me?

271
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,574
Will they do that?

272
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,836
It's the wrong way around.

273
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,840
It's my lucky cigarette.

274
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,261
Well...

275
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,473
whatever you do, don't smoke it.

276
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,517
You know they have
a drive-thru, right?

277
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,269
No, this is good.

278
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,023
Could use the exercise,
get the blood pumping.

279
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,943
Don't worry, you're not
gonna have to pick me up.

280
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,072
Might take me a while,
but l'll get there.

281
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:26,368
Jesus, ain't we a pair.

282
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,537
Hey, you must
really like chicken.

283
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:37,212
V-8, 470 horses, 20-inch rims,
satellite radio, Bluetooth.

284
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,757
Zero to 60 in 4.7 seconds.

285
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,259
Whoa, whoa, what do you mean,
on a lark?

286
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:47,889
Spur of the moment,
your dad ups and buys you
a brand-new Challenger?

287
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,101
Yeah, I barely got it
around the block

288
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,772
and Mom said we couldn't
afford it, so they took it back.

289
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,484
Do you know how long l had it?
Fifteen hours.

290
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,570
Well, hey, buddy,
let me tell you something.

291
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,156
When I was your age,

292
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,786
I'd have given my left nut
to drive a car like that
for 1 5 minutes. Heh.

293
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,330
Seriously,
how does that happen?

294
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,668
Well, we were looking
at used cars and l kind of--

295
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,212
Ah, you guilted him into it.
I know. I hear you.

296
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,091
You pulled the old, "Poor little me
and my troubles," am I right?

297
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,386
Maybe.
You flew too close to the sun.

298
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,597
You'd have let him
buy you a clunker,
you'd be driving now

299
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,225
instead of borrowing
mom's hooptie.

300
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,435
Agent Schrader.

301
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,645
Hey, how you doing?
Well, thank you.

302
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,565
Good to see you.
Do you remember Mr. Fring?

303
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,359
How are you?
Well. Nice to see you again.

304
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,362
It's a pleasure to see you.
You're looking well.

305
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,533
Yeah, well, you know, chalk it up
to clean living and vitamin pills.

306
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,620
I must apologize.
If I had seen you come in,

307
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,081
there'd have been no question
of accepting your money.

308
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,417
In the future,
feel free to ask for me.

309
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,629
A DEA hero should never have to pay
for a meal at Pollos Hermanos.

310
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,550
No kidding? Well, l'll take you up
on that, for sure. Ha-ha-ha.

311
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,594
And how are your mother
and father?

312
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,179
They're good.

313
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,389
The chicken is great.
Thank you.

314
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,601
If ever you're interested
in rewarding part-time work,

315
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,645
perhaps something after school,
my door is open.

316
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,355
Sounds good.

317
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:23,818
Uh, I don't know about this one.
He might eat up all your profits.

318
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,739
I'll let you finish your meal.
Can l get you anything else?

319
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,909
A refill, perhaps?
No, thank you. I'm good.

320
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:34,996
Sure. Take a Diet Coke, thank you.
Of course.

321
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,490
So where are we going?

322
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:15,161
Oh, big doings today.

323
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:21,042
The order of the day is eyes open,
mouth shut.

324
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,628
What's up?

325
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:16,598
Test.

326
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,141
You got me?

327
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,018
Count off.

328
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,363
Let's go.

329
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,869
Right here.
Leave the wrap on, please.

330
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,373
You know how
to make coffee?

331
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:43,875
Sure.

332
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,877
There you go.

333
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,590
You want a rundown?
Please.

334
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:54,427
Three guys up at the gate,
two visible, one in the blind.

335
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:58,514
We got five guys down here
with a backup out of sight.

336
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,976
I got Tyrus down in the tree line
with a Barrett .50.

337
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:06,356
Planted him there last night,
in case we had any early arrivals.

338
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,174
I don't have an extra holster.

339
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,927
Stick this in your pocket.
Keep it out of sight.

340
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,807
If you're gonna be here today,
you're gonna have a gun.

341
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,354
It's loaded?

342
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:53,278
I don't wanna see that
in your hand unless
you see me with mine.

343
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,822
Emergency only.

344
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,908
First car is coming.

345
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:05,290
All right,
what's the order of the day?

346
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,834
Eyes open, mouth shut.

347
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,108
A lot of guns.

348
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,236
Nobody's asking you
to give up yours.

349
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,576
You wanna sweep the place
before you bring in your guys?

350
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:26,204
I am the guy.

351
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,584
All right, then.

352
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,215
Welcome.

353
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,510
Where is the rest
of your party?

354
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,805
I am the only one coming.

355
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,848
And why is that?

356
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,937
My employers feel l can adequately
represent their interests.

357
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,484
Please, sit.

358
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,126
This is my offer.

359
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:18,214
In consideration
of our previous relationship...

360
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,679
I will make a one-time payment

361
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:29,225
of 50 million U.S. dollars.

362
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:36,774
In return,
our business is concluded.

363
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,362
No further payments.
No further contact.

364
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:44,407
An absolute severance.

365
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,586
You have no response?

366
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,466
This is my response:

367
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,551
Yes or no?

368
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,472
You know what
the Cartel wants.

369
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,225
Anything else would be
a waste of time.

370
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:16,731
Is it to be yes or no?

371
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,486
A hard way to begin
a negotiation.

372
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,407
This is not a negotiation.

373
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,176
You got something of mine?

374
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,811
Glove box.

375
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,234
Figure I better teach you
how to shoot.

376
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,444
Could be things
are gonna get hairy.

377
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,324
What is this?

378
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:54,036
I mean, you're giving me a gun,

379
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:57,999
and now l'm, like,
part of the team, or whatever?

380
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,296
He said he sees something in me.

381
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,673
Like what?

382
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,471
If I had to put it in a word,

383
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:17,101
I'd guess loyalty.

384
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,145
Loyalty.

385
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,485
Only maybe you got it
for the wrong guy.

386
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,172
Jesse?

387
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,883
Hey.
Hey.

388
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,010
Long time, no see.

389
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,348
How you doing?

390
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,851
Yeah, you know,
uh, good.

391
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,605
Good.

392
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,693
Okay, we're gonna get started.
You coming in?

393
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,909
So the truth is, we can't change
the past, what's done is done.

394
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:18,537
We've gotta own our actions.
But putting ourselves on trial,

395
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,667
acting as our own judge, jury
and executioner, it's not the answer.

396
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,169
A lot of the time,
all that judging does

397
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:29,757
is just ensure that we're
gonna repeat the cycle.

398
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,717
Right?

399
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,095
"l'm such an asshole.

400
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,099
It's totally hopeless,
what's the point?

401
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,142
I think I'll have a hit."

402
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,603
Jesse,

403
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,065
what's going on with you
these days?

404
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:52,405
I, uh, went back to the crystal.

405
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,699
You sober now?

406
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,367
Yeah.

407
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,202
Four days.

408
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,453
Big whoop, right?

409
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,414
Hey, four days is four days.

410
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,998
You're here.

411
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,584
You still

412
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,629
working at the laundry?

413
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:09,964
How are things there?

414
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,551
Sucks ass.

415
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,263
Anything you wanna talk about?

416
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,643
Um...

417
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,734
A couple of weeks back,

418
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:31,944
I, uh...

419
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,530
I killed a dog.

420
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,785
You hit it with your car?

421
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,331
No, I, um...

422
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,585
I put him down.

423
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,504
I watched him go.

424
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:53,883
I was looking him
straight in the eye.

425
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,764
He didn't know what was happening.
He didn't know why. He--

426
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,143
He was just scared.

427
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,189
And then he was gone.

428
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,900
He was suffering.

429
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,818
It was a kindness.

430
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,697
No, he wasn't sick.

431
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,452
No. He was just, like, uh...

432
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,830
I don't know, like,

433
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,875
a problem dog.

434
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,877
What did he do?

435
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,086
Bite someone?

436
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,300
No, this dog never--

437
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,011
Never bit anybody.

438
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:43,891
You pick up the rock,
you go right to the dark side.

439
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,184
Anything can happen.

440
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,686
It ain't no rock
that made me do it.

441
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,314
What was the problem?
Why did you kill him?

442
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,733
Watch the crosstalk, please.

443
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:57,947
Maybe it's not the details
that matter, right?

444
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,866
How do you feel about
what you did, Jesse?

445
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,913
I don't know.

446
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,251
Who cares how you feel?

447
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,212
What kind of person kills a dog
for no reason?

448
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,463
Colleen.

449
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,341
Put an ad in the paper,
drop him off at a shelter.

450
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:21,679
You don't just sit there
and talk about killing
a helpless, innocent animal.

451
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,765
We're not here to sit
in judgment.

452
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,434
Why not?

453
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,355
Why not? Maybe she's right.

454
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:36,068
Maybe I should have put it
in the paper. I should've
done something different.

455
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:43,534
The thing is, if you just do stuff
and nothing happens...

456
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,288
what's it all mean?

457
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,164
What's the point?

458
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,504
Oh, right, this whole thing
is about self-acceptance.

459
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,966
Kicking yourself doesn't
give meaning to anything.

460
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:03,304
So I should stop judging

461
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,390
- and accept?
- It's a start.

462
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,226
So no matter what I do,

463
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,770
hooray for me
because l'm a great guy?

464
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,023
It's all good?

465
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:20,779
No matter how many
dogs I kill, I just, what,
do an inventory and accept?

466
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:28,621
I mean, you back your truck over
your own kid and you, like, accept?

467
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,957
What a load of crap?
Hey, Jesse.

468
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,334
I know you're in pain.

469
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,586
No, you know what?

470
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,049
Why l'm here in the first place...

471
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,595
is to sell you meth.

472
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,309
You're nothing to me
but customers!

473
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,273
I made you my bitch.

474
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,859
You okay with that?

475
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:02,529
Huh? You accept?

476
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:05,658
No.

477
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,628
About time.

478
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:50,202
Jesse.

479
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,913
Bring a light over here,
will you?

480
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,594
Do you see
any residue there?

481
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,179
Where?

482
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:13,600
Here. On the bottom,
right there.

483
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,939
It's been a week.
What's going on?

484
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,859
I haven't seen him.

485
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:27,489
I didn't think so. But I'll just
give it another shot anyway.

486
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,599
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy. Look at that.

487
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:57,394
Graduated to doorman.
Finally found your calling.
Heh-heh-heh.

488
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,480
Ooh, little whiskers, Marie.

489
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,689
What did you do?

490
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:05,110
Show your barber a picture
of a dog's ass and said,
"l'll take that"? Heh-heh-heh.

491
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,528
Charming as usual.

492
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:07,905
Welcome back.

493
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,324
Looking good, Marie.
Oh, thanks, Steve.

494
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:14,661
Good to see you. How you doing?
He's fine. We can take it from here.

495
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,830
Yeah.
If you wanna hold his elbow.

496
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:21,085
No, no, no.
You keep your mitts off me.
I'm good. I'm good.

497
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,380
Hey.

498
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,383
Good luck.

499
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,808
Let's go, we're running late.
Come on.

500
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:45,275
Hank, seeing you walk
in here, I can't tell you
what that means to all of us.

501
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,612
Your progress,
it's incredible.

502
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,116
Yeah, well, chalk it up
to clean living and vitamin pills.

503
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,911
Steve tell you his news?
What?

504
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,163
Finally got your period?
Heh.

505
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,207
I made GS-14.

506
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,084
Wow, that's all right,
man.

507
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:05,129
Next stop: Washington, D.C.
Sitting behind a desk,

508
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,756
papers piled so high,
you can't see over them.

509
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,758
Hey, better you than me, buddy.

510
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,969
Seriously,
congratulations, buddy.

511
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,554
Thanks.

512
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,056
Steve said you might
have something for us.

513
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:19,226
Yeah, maybe. You guys
are gonna have to tell me.

514
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,437
Remember my pal
Tim Roberts?

515
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,897
APD detective?

516
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,316
Yeah, well, he's working
on a murder case.

517
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,944
The victim's a 34-year-old
male Caucasian

518
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,238
by the name
of Gale Boetticher.

519
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,908
One night last month,
Boetticher opens the door,
and, bam,

520
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:39,329
takes a bullet to the face
from a person or persons unknown.

521
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,417
Now, this Gale Boetticher
is a bona fide chemistry genius.

522
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:46,628
I mean, he's got degrees
up the wazoo, right?

523
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:51,091
And, well, as you might expect,
he's a nerd's nerd.

524
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:54,136
Vegan, sandals and socks
kind of guy.

525
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:59,558
As it turns out, he's also
an A-number-one meth cook.

526
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:04,855
And what caught my eye
is his specialty product is blue.

527
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,107
So, what are you thinking?

528
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,650
This is your Heisenberg?

529
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:14,573
No. What I think we got here is, uh,
ahem, Heisenberg's former cook

530
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:18,327
and maybe a line
on Heisenberg himself.

531
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,500
Anyway, lo and behold,
amidst all the hippie-dippy
nonsense, ahem,

532
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,085
I find this.

533
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:31,298
Now, this here,
I do a little Google-fu

534
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:36,762
and I realize it's a parts number,
specifically for this baby.

535
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:43,644
That there is a high-volume
HEPA industrial air filtration system.

536
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:45,687
That's a 300,000-dollar gadget.

537
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:50,150
Perfect for a pharmaceutical plant
or microchip factory

538
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:55,405
or maybe the biggest meth lab
north of the border.

539
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,992
Okay.

540
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,662
So this little dingus here
is manufactured

541
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:06,959
by a big international concern:
Madrigal Electromotive.

542
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:11,755
I call their Houston office,
I get through to the nicest
little 20-year-old temp.

543
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:16,009
I use the Schrader sweet-talk.
Before you know it,
she's pulling files.

544
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:21,598
Six months ago, one of
these systems was shipped
to a depot here in ABQ.

545
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,809
Who signed for it?

546
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:25,352
Gale Boetticher.

547
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:31,441
So I asked my new girlfriend,
"Who paid for it?"
And she says, "Nobody."

548
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,571
They have no record that anybody
actually paid for this thing.

549
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,200
So I go back and push more
and before you know it

550
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,452
the temp's gone, there's no address.

551
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,623
I'm talking to some snot-nose
lawyer who's asking me for my
badge number.

552
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,667
Brick wall.

553
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:53,630
So I take a peek into
Madrigal Electromotive.

554
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,383
Now, Madrigal
is based in Hanover, Germany,

555
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:59,303
but they're what they call
"highly diversified."

556
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,265
Industrial equipment,
global shipping,
major construction

557
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:07,728
and a tiny little foothold
in American fast food,

558
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,314
specifically a local chain.

559
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,524
Pollos Hermanos.

560
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,196
Okay. So what, right?
Boetticher's dead.

561
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,366
I got no line on who's
been bankrolling him

562
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,452
or where his lab was.

563
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,912
The whole thing's
a snipe hunt, right?

564
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,708
But now I get this crazy idea

565
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,669
and I can't shake it.

566
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,131
I mean, I stay up nights
staring at the ceiling,

567
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,633
trying to make sense of it.
That napkin.

568
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,469
I told you
Boetticher's vegan.

569
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:44,014
We're talking this guy
makes his own
fermented lentil bread,

570
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,391
or whatever the hell that is.

571
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:52,022
What's a vegan doing
in a fried chicken joint?

572
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,235
Maybe he's meeting somebody.

573
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,154
Like who?

574
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,823
Well, like, maybe...

575
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,494
this guy.

576
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,876
I mean, what do we know
about Gustavo Fring, huh?

577
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,420
This whole
friend-of-law-enforcement thing? Eh.

578
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,757
Could be a case of "keep your friends
close but your enemies closer."

579
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:21,009
He's got the money
to finance this operation.

580
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,930
Maybe he's got the connections too.
Maybe, just maybe...

581
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,765
he's our guy.

582
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,731
Hank, no offense,
but l think you're
really reaching.

583
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:38,193
If your guy had his meeting
at KFC,

584
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:42,406
you wouldn't immediately
assume he's sitting down
with Colonel Sanders.

585
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,282
You know, I-- Ahem.

586
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:47,077
I couldn't agree more,
guys. Heh.

587
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:52,040
Gustavo Fring, blue meth,
you know.

588
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:57,087
The whole thing
is off-the-map nuts.

589
00:45:57,547 --> 00:46:01,049
I ought to be wearing
a tinfoil hat, you know?

590
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,802
Except...

591
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:08,849
I can't seem to wrap my mind
around this one little thing,

592
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:13,979
and that is, what are
Gustavo Fring's fingerprints

593
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,607
doing in
Gale Boetticher's apartment?
