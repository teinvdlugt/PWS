1
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,237
Hold it. Watch it, watch it.

2
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,573
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

3
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,826
- Got it. Got it.
- Thank you.

4
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,037
On your shoulder,
put it on your shoulder.

5
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,289
- Watch the step.
- Watch the step.

6
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,375
Easy, easy.

7
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,710
If you need some help
down there, say something.

8
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,462
- Watch it.
- Keep it coming.

9
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,464
- Don't go too fast.
- Easy.

10
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,174
Whoa, whoa. whoa.

11
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,469
That's it, come on.

12
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,013
You hit me in the foot.

13
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,933
Watch the car.

14
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,103
- The car's right here.
- That's it.

15
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,027
Watch where you step.

16
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,075
Oh, man.

17
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,994
Rusty?

18
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,705
What was Rusty's last name?

19
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,833
Tomasky.

20
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:52,254
He got me in with the band.
I'm a roadie.

21
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,965
What were you doing
in Twin Peaks?

22
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,676
We were supposed to play a gig
in Knife River,

23
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,138
but a tire on the van crapped out.

24
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,348
Then you met someone.

25
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,602
Yeah, this guy...
This guy came out of the woods,

26
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,062
like Bigfoot or something,

27
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,941
and he was wearing a weird suit.

28
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,693
And we talked to him for a while

29
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:20,240
and he said he had some brew,
you know, would we like some?

30
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,202
So Rusty went with him.

31
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,913
I didn't see him after that.

32
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,542
We'll need to get in touch
with Rusty's parents.

33
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,379
Heh. He hated his parents.

34
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:41,178
He's staying with his uncle
in Moses Lake until we were gonna...

35
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,305
We were gonna move.

36
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,474
We were gonna move to L.A.

37
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,109
Andy.

38
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,989
Ow, my foot! Watch it.

39
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,034
He's taken another pawn, Harry,

40
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,328
but he didn't tell us his move.

41
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,332
Windom Earle's
playing off the board.

42
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,884
- Morning, Lucy.
- Morning, Sheriff Truman.

43
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,427
- Morning, Lucy.
- Agent Cooper.

44
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,721
Deputy Hawk is in your office,
sheriff.

45
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,598
He's with somebody
I've never seen before,

46
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,602
but he looks really sad,
so Hawk is feeding him breakfast.

47
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,648
Andy.

48
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,071
Yes, Lucy?

49
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,366
What do you know
about saving our planet?

50
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,410
I know it's in a lot of trouble.

51
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,580
Andy, I'm taking fate
into my own hands.

52
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,334
Mostly because the suspense
is too much for me.

53
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,088
Tomorrow is D-day. Dad Day.

54
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:03,885
In 24 hours,
I will choose the father of my child.

55
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,762
Deputy Andy Brennan

56
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:10,267
or clothing salesman
Richard Tremayne.

57
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,689
What does that have to do
with the Miss Twin Peaks contest?

58
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:20,861
I... I mean, we could use
the money.

59
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,863
We could also use a father.

60
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,908
So I have to make a speech
about saving our planet,

61
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,618
which is a great concept,

62
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:32,331
but I have no idea
how to go about it.

63
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,790
Yet.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,337
I do know that people have got to stop
sinking their beer cans in Pearl Lake

65
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,588
when they're fishing.

66
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,215
Oh. Beer cans.

67
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:47,721
And, um, Styrofoam never dies
for as long as you live.

68
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,433
It doesn't?

69
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,991
- Randy, has Audrey returned?
- No, sir.

70
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,286
- No messages from her?
- No, sir.

71
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,455
Would you send someone up
for my bags, please?

72
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,207
Certainly.

73
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,968
The insurance companies
send me so many forms

74
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,305
that I could get a heart attack
just lifting them.

75
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,891
You're fine.

76
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,979
It's what's in your heart
you should be worried about.

77
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,693
I know that I have given you
reason to doubt me.

78
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,491
But I am only interested in doing
the right thing for everybody.

79
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,493
Then stay away from Eileen.

80
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,495
I can't.

81
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,873
Not as long as the lie survives.

82
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,502
Damn it, Ben. It's not that simple.

83
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,129
I believe you.

84
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,758
I applaud your desire
to do the right thing.

85
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,971
But goodness in you is...
It's like a time bomb.

86
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,351
There's nothing good
about ruined lives.

87
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,230
It is a confusing
and difficult process.

88
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,275
But I must continue.

89
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,862
Sorry, Will.

90
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,117
Ah. Excuse me. Mm.

91
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,662
- Jack, come on in.
- Hi.

92
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,372
You know Will Hayward?

93
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,709
Yes, hello. I've met your daughter.
She's a lovely girl.

94
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:45,088
I should be getting back
to my office.

95
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,885
Nice to see you again, John.

96
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,975
Ben, be careful, please.

97
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,232
I've been looking for Audrey.

98
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,152
Oh. She should be back any minute.

99
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,529
Ben, I gotta go.

100
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,239
They're gassing up the jet
as we speak.

101
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,743
Well, you can call her
when you get to wherever it is

102
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,245
you are in such a hurry to get to.

103
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,581
A friend of mine...

104
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,918
He was more than a friend. He was
a partner... he's been murdered.

105
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,272
Female child.

106
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,027
Mother, Eileen Hayward.

107
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,405
Daughter, Donna Marie.

108
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,242
Father...

109
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,343
Donna? Donna, where are you?

110
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,636
What is it, Mom?

111
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,556
Deputy Hawk is on the phone.

112
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,099
I'll be right there.

113
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,643
He says it's important.

114
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,160
- Ms. Horne, I have several messages.
- Great.

115
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,037
I'll take that for you.

116
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,291
Okay. Thanks.

117
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,750
Audrey.

118
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,254
Agent Cooper would like to see you
at the sheriff's station.

119
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,340
Oh, well, I have a lot of work to do.
Maybe this afternoon.

120
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,051
Now. It's important.

121
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,470
Okay.

122
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,517
But what about Stop Ghostwood?

123
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,186
How am I supposed
to get ahold of you?

124
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,230
I need more time.

125
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,816
A brave man is dead.

126
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,612
He's my friend,
and I have to take his place.

127
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,572
You aren't coming back, are you?

128
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,745
Damn this rainforest business
anyway.

129
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,496
You can handle this without me.

130
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,499
I don't know.
I'm afraid that I'm weak.

131
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,670
Ben Horne, weak?
I find that hard to believe.

132
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,548
Strive for goodness, huh?

133
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,259
Tell the hardest truth first.

134
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,136
Just do the best you can.

135
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,888
That's all you really can do.

136
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,348
Hmm.

137
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,602
Well, I'm sorry
that Audrey wasn't here.

138
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,984
I want you to give her
something for me.

139
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,446
Tell her I...

140
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,532
Just give it to her, will you?

141
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,664
Good luck.

142
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,458
See if any
of these symbols have to do

143
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,919
with harvest schedules
or ancient calendars.

144
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,712
Look for any curious nomenclature.

145
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,589
Got it, chief.

146
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,052
Good work, Cappy.

147
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,429
- Major. How goes the battle?
- Harry.

148
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,556
- Agent Cooper.
- Major, you look bushed.

149
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,686
Well, I spent the night obtaining and
perusing the Project Blue Book files

150
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,354
regarding Windom Earle.

151
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,439
I found it impossible to sleep after.

152
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,274
What have you gleaned?

153
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,319
Earle was the best
and brightest among us.

154
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,488
But when our attention
turned from outer space

155
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,740
to the wooded areas
surrounding Twin Peaks,

156
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,909
he became destructively obsessive.

157
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:47,497
Earle acted in an overzealous
and secretive manner.

158
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,334
Possessive of his assignments,
finally violent.

159
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,628
He was removed from the project.

160
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,173
I found this in the project archives.

161
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,595
These... These evil sorcerers,
dugpas, they're called,

162
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:06,349
they cultivate evil for the sake of evil,
nothing else.

163
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,895
They express themselves
in darkness for darkness

164
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,523
without leavening motive. Uh...

165
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:18,278
Now, this... This ardent purity
allows them to access a secret place

166
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,781
where the cultivation of evil proceeds
in exponential fashion,

167
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:26,286
and with it, the furtherance
of evil's resulting power.

168
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:31,416
This place of power is tangible,
and as such, it can be found, entered

169
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,210
and perhaps utilized
in some fashion.

170
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,963
The dugpas have many names
for it,

171
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:42,302
but chief among them, ahem, is the...
Is the Black Lodge.

172
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,388
You don't believe me, do you?
You think I'm mad.

173
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,557
Overworked.

174
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,809
Go away.

175
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:00,737
Gentlemen, when Windom Earle
arrived in Twin Peaks,

176
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,364
I assumed
he had come for vengeance.

177
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,991
For me.

178
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,826
But I miscalculated.

179
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,413
He has insinuated himself
into the lives of people I care for.

180
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,124
He has murdered innocents.

181
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,711
He has engaged us in subterfuge
and red herring.

182
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,546
A fish I don't particularly care for.

183
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,633
But all of these acts
are merely camouflage.

184
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,677
He's been after something else
all along:

185
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,305
the Black Lodge.

186
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:34,145
Fellas, we need to find out what this,
the Black Lodge, has to do with that.

187
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,025
Do you really believe
there's a connection?

188
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,945
Windom Earle does, Harry.

189
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,456
All right. Harry, we're gonna go
through these files from top to bottom.

190
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:57,210
Cappy, I want you to dig up
everything you can about the dugpas.

191
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,963
Major,
I think you'd better hit the sack.

192
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,048
I could use a good stretch.

193
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,050
Perhaps a walk in the woods
to clear my mind.

194
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,135
Good idea.
Don't forget the bread crumbs.

195
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,554
Right.

196
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:13,059
Harry, let's do it.

197
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,107
You know, Leo, the only thing
that Columbus discovered

198
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,316
was that he was lost.

199
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,155
Cooper and the gang
haven't even left the snide yet.

200
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,951
I know something they don't know.

201
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,746
I know something
young Dale merely suspects.

202
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,665
Project Blue Book.

203
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,960
Little men,
pewits loaded with optimism. Heh.

204
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,964
They were a deterrent so slight
it was practically encouragement.

205
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,968
Yet I would like to ask Major Briggs
a question or three.

206
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:51,681
Polish up that bald nub of his
and see what shines.

207
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,481
Perhaps, Leo, we too
should venture out for a good stretch.

208
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,735
Wouldn't it be fun to have
a Project Blue Book reunion?

209
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,029
Wine, cheese, talk about old times,

210
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,699
trade hilarious anecdotes
of the good old days.

211
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:14,162
I wonder what amongst my detritus
I can use to spice up Briggs' life.

212
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,040
Leo, stop dawdling.

213
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,460
If you were outside,
you'd have trouble with pigeons.

214
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,224
"And that's the only way
we're ever going to save the trees.

215
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,686
It's time to stand up and kick some butt
for our environment.

216
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,731
Before it's too late for all of us."

217
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,902
It's beautiful, letter-perfect.

218
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,406
I don't know about
the "kick butt" part.

219
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,826
How about, um, "fight"?

220
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,788
It's time to stand up
and fight for our environment.

221
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,790
Much better.

222
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,168
Shelly, I've been thinking.

223
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,587
Oh, Bobby, I know, I know, I know.

224
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:08,299
- The speech counts double...
- Forget about the contest.

225
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,009
I've been thinking about us.

226
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,262
You have?

227
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:19,268
I know that I have not been paying
the right kind of attention to you lately.

228
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,939
I got busy with Mr. Horne.

229
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,192
I started wearing suits, okay,
and suddenly I'm walking around

230
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,653
like I'm more important
than everybody else.

231
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,489
You were pretty crummy.

232
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:39,706
Bobby, I've missed you.

233
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,835
I've missed all the things
we used to do together.

234
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,342
When I saw you kissing that guy,
whew, something snapped.

235
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:55,013
It was like my brain rolled over,

236
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,059
and I could see all the stuff
that was special to me.

237
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,395
All the stuff that matters.

238
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,899
I love you, Shelly.

239
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,778
And I wanna spend my time
with that.

240
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,781
I mean, you know,
if that's okay with you,

241
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,784
I'd like to do that, you know...

242
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,749
Bobby, what do you think?

243
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,925
Lucky.

244
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,303
Lucky me.

245
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,556
Shelly, telephone.

246
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,226
Agent Cooper's on the line.
He needs to talk to you.

247
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,730
Now, Shelly. He says it's important.

248
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,294
- I've got great news.
- What?

249
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:13,341
It's going to be Norma Jennings
and Richard Tremayne.

250
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,594
Tremayne is the third judge.
It's in the bag.

251
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,930
Well, now, I have to be sure.

252
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,015
Baby, I have to be sure
I'm gonna win.

253
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:27,146
Oh, my God, this guy's British
or Bahamian or something.

254
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,482
He's bound to fall for your charms.

255
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:35,613
We'll find some way
to get you two together, alone.

256
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,741
And then
you put on a dress with a slit.

257
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,703
Oh, the slit cut halfway
up to Seattle.

258
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,543
And then nestle in real close to him,

259
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,213
and when he gets a look
at those gams

260
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:58,719
and smells that French perfume
dripping off you and then

261
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:05,852
becomes lost
in those brown eyes, oh...

262
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,688
Mm, mm, mm.

263
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,190
Oh, stop it. Stop it.

264
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,359
Stop it, you vixen, you.

265
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,611
I can't stand it anymore.

266
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,905
Why can't we just elope and?

267
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:22,243
- No. Now, not until I've won, darling.
- Oh.

268
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,497
Then, and only then,
I will marry you.

269
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,332
Oh...

270
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,627
Oh, you're so strict, darling.

271
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,921
And I am the blasted mayor.

272
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,674
Oh, now, baby, come here.

273
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,468
It's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

274
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,678
It's okay.

275
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,933
Each of you received
a piece of this poem.

276
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,353
Each in a curious manner,
along with this invitation.

277
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,690
We all went to the Roadhouse.
Nobody showed up.

278
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,195
Have any of you had
contact recently with a stranger?

279
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:03,284
Someone who struck you as peculiar,
personable or just plain puzzling?

280
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,997
Well, there was this strange guy who
said he was a friend of my father's.

281
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,375
Same day I got the poem,
I got a $10 tip for a cup of coffee.

282
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,669
That's unusual.

283
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,005
You know, there was a funny old guy
at the library.

284
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,299
He asked me
to read the poem to him.

285
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,468
All three.

286
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,262
Shelly, take a closer look.

287
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,890
Does this handwriting
look familiar to you?

288
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,938
It's Leo's.

289
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,358
Listen carefully.

290
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:39,111
I want each of you to check in
with the sheriff twice a day.

291
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,782
Nine o'clock in the morning,
9:00 at night.

292
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,744
I want your parents
to know your whereabouts at all times.

293
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,414
You walk to school,
you drive to work,

294
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,668
make sure
that you do not do so alone.

295
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,339
Please believe me
when I tell you to be very careful.

296
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,633
You're in danger.

297
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,678
We all are.

298
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,900
Heh. You would've
appreciated the dugpas, Leo.

299
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,821
Ancient sorcerers bent on evil.
Ha-ha-ha.

300
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,699
Rather like the Kali worshippers
in India.

301
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,076
Another fine bunch of zanies,
I can tell you.

302
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,161
Blood for breakfast, blood for lunch.

303
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,750
Those were the good old days.

304
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:40,047
- Shelly.
- Very good, Leo, you remember.

305
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,508
Tawdry little trollop.

306
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,010
Shelly.

307
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,220
Just between you and me, old boy,

308
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:50,641
your wife has some
fairly modern views on marital fidelity.

309
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,560
But no matter.

310
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,854
She is still fit for a queen.

311
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:59,233
Would you mourn her passing, Leo?
I doubt it.

312
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,696
Her death, Leo.

313
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:07,908
Shelly's imminent demise.

314
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,785
It's very simple, really.

315
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,080
Shelly wins Miss Twin Peaks,
Shelly dies.

316
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,999
Maybe you'd like to help.

317
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,126
Shelly. No.

318
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,131
Good God, what have you got there?

319
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,635
No, Leo, I'm begging you.

320
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:30,181
- I prithee. Have mercy, Leo.
- Love Shelly.

321
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,539
Poor Leo. Ha-ha-ha.

322
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,293
We are all love's fools, more or less.

323
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,796
But you will learn, as I have,

324
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,882
the value of hate.

325
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,260
Hi.

326
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,537
- Hi, Daddy.
- Oh, Audrey.

327
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,039
- Welcome home, honey.
- Thanks.

328
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,249
Mwah.

329
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,918
I got back this morning but
Agent Cooper needed to see me, so...

330
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,128
Something's wrong?

331
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,630
- Some creep sent me a poem.
- Oh.

332
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,841
Um, I tried to call Jack's room,
but he wasn't there.

333
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:51,345
- Do you know where he is?
- Audrey, while you were gone,

334
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,975
- I had the most incredible brainstorm.
- What?

335
00:23:56,226 --> 00:24:00,896
The Stop Ghostwood movement
needs a spokesperson.

336
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,483
Someone with a highly visible profile

337
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:08,112
to be able to inspire
our community to action. Huh?

338
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,906
Daddy, where's Jack?

339
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,201
You can do it, Audrey.

340
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,787
As Miss Twin Peaks,

341
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,207
you could be that spokesperson and
you could use your public platform...

342
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:24,170
- Heh. No, Dad.
...as a forum for environmental debate.

343
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,505
Audrey, listen, you can do it.

344
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,508
Only you can take our message
to the people.

345
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:35,306
Daddy,
where is John Justice Wheeler?

346
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,686
- He's gone.
- Where did he go?

347
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:48,360
Some tragedy in Brazil
demanded his immediate attention.

348
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:53,115
He left a letter for you.
I have it here.

349
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,867
Daddy.

350
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,623
- When did he leave?
- A few minutes ago, the airport.

351
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,334
Audrey,
what about Miss Twin Peaks?

352
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,711
I'll talk with you about this later,
okay? I promise.

353
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,048
Audrey. Audrey. Audrey?

354
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,138
Josie, I see your face.

355
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,099
- Randy.
- Yes.

356
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,102
Oh, forget it. You.

357
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,687
Do you have a car?

358
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,023
A truck. Runs like a dream.

359
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,150
Great, let's go.

360
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,612
Wait. Oh, I'm sorry.

361
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,074
Come on. Come on.

362
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,372
Well, the symbols suggest a time.

363
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,666
Seems clear.

364
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,169
- A time for what?
- I don't know.

365
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,464
At first I thought it was a signpost.
Perhaps it's an invitation.

366
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,132
Or both.

367
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,509
Hmm.

368
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,928
Where's the major?

369
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,180
He should be here by now.

370
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:02,685
Andy, give Mrs. Briggs a call,
see if the major's home yet.

371
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,905
What is it, Coop?

372
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,784
Oh, just thinking
about Annie Blackburn.

373
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,330
Well, bless your heart.
I've never known your mind to wander.

374
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,584
Oh, Harry,
I've been feeling this way all day.

375
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:31,755
You know, I proceed as usual,
my mind clear and focused,

376
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:38,220
and suddenly, out of nowhere,
I see her face and I hear her voice.

377
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,600
Naturally, I try to reorient myself,
come back to the task at hand,

378
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,020
but the image remains.

379
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,355
Sometimes I actually feel dizzy.

380
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,734
A man in love
is supposed to feel that way.

381
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,945
Well, my symptoms suggest
the onset of malaria.

382
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,573
But I've never felt better in my life.

383
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,535
I'm sorry, Harry, that sounds foolish.

384
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,706
No, no, man, it sounds lucky.

385
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,781
Hmm.

386
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,332
Home, home on the range

387
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,336
Where the deer
And the antelope play

388
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:57,424
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word

389
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,885
Hello, Wilbur.

390
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:13,148
And the skies are not cloudy all day

391
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,240
Long time no see, Briggsy.

392
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,038
Leo.

393
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,582
It looks like
you've finally found your calling.

394
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,775
Couldn't hurt to give it a shot.

395
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,027
Maybe next year.

396
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,573
Annie, there's a whole world out there.
Jump in.

397
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,409
"Hear the other side.
See the other side."

398
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,952
St. Augustine.

399
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,455
- Coffee?
- You bet.

400
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:27,014
- Something's troubling you.
- Yes.

401
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,224
Would you like to talk about it?

402
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,480
Annie, I'm involved
in a fairly complicated investigation

403
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,648
requiring my complete attention.

404
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,860
Yet I spend most of my time
thinking of you.

405
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,321
I know the feeling.

406
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,948
I've been seeing your face
in fried eggs all this morning.

407
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,955
You know, there are those who believe
in a scientific basis for attraction.

408
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,582
It's chemical.

409
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,667
Is that what it is?

410
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,711
I don't know.

411
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:01,632
Hard to comprehend
without perspective.

412
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,509
Yeah.

413
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:06,970
I spent five years
trying to comprehend it, heh.

414
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,431
Hey.

415
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,059
It's hard for me.

416
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:16,146
But I have faith in you,
in us, because I understand it.

417
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,106
We're very much alike.

418
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,733
It helps.

419
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,194
We think too much.

420
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,239
"What we observe
is not nature itself,

421
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:29,076
but nature exposed
to our method of questioning."

422
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,371
Heisenberg.

423
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,710
Maybe we should go bowling.

424
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,712
How about dancing?

425
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,297
I don't know how.

426
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,216
I'll teach you. It's easy.

427
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,845
- When?
- Tonight.

428
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,960
There he is. Step on it.

429
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,887
Jack! Jack, stop!

430
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,481
I guess a simple goodbye
was out of the question.

431
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,411
I love you.

432
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,955
I love you too.

433
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,836
- Do you have to leave?
- Yes.

434
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,713
When will you be back?

435
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,466
I don't know.

436
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,177
I'm a virgin.

437
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,804
What?

438
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,350
I want you to make love with me.

439
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,394
What? Here and now?

440
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,397
It's your jet.

441
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,568
Thank God for that.

442
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:01,520
When did you first see
the symbol in Owl Cave?

443
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,690
I'm not at liberty
to divulge that information.

444
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,983
Oh-ho-ho.

445
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,402
Cheater. Ha, ha.

446
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,910
What does the cave painting mean?

447
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:22,040
I'm not at liberty
to divulge that information.

448
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,004
Damn, but I love the military mind.

449
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:38,390
What is the capital of North Carolina?

450
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,559
Raleigh.

451
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,355
Fat lot of good that will do me.

452
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:50,027
Major, I admire your fortitude.

453
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,571
Had I the time and patience,

454
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,949
we might continue this game
indefinitely.

455
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,660
However,

456
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,039
I have neither.

457
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,755
Catch.

458
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,346
Your name, please?

459
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,973
Garland Briggs.

460
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:24,895
Garland, what do you fear most
in the world?

461
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:29,316
The possibility
that love is not enough.

462
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:33,070
Oh, Garland, please, I shall weep.

463
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,989
How much does your wife weigh?

464
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,366
One hundred and fifteen pounds.

465
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,328
Oh, good for her.

466
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:46,333
Now, when did you first see
the petroglyph in Owl Cave?

467
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,503
In... In dreams.

468
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,089
What kind of dreams?

469
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:57,636
I was night fishing
with Agent Cooper.

470
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:02,641
There was a light,
guardian beyond it.

471
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:07,395
I was taken, but my mind...

472
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,065
Still I recognized the signs.

473
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:14,402
What do the signs mean?

474
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:20,575
There's a time,
if Jupiter and Saturn meet,

475
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,120
they will receive you.

476
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,256
Garland, Garland.

477
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:40,303
Garland, Garland, I was hoping
for a lengthy conversation.

478
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,640
Leo, put the major to bed.

479
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,018
I'm afraid his mind
has begun to wander.

480
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:53,775
There's a time,
if Jupiter and Saturn meet.

481
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,783
His woman servant, Jones,

482
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,619
delivered this to me
shortly after he died.

483
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,496
Eckhardt's last bequest.

484
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:10,709
A clever jape, perhaps,
or something of value.

485
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,669
Try this.

486
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:19,009
No, you see, there's a secret
to opening each of these boxes.

487
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:24,222
And this one
is about to drive me mad.

488
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,224
Oh, Andrew,
tell me something good.

489
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:32,147
Our foreign investors are chomping
at the bit from Paris to Beijing.

490
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,815
You're going to get your golf course.

491
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,318
Right next to
The Great Northern Hotel.

492
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,529
And Benjamin is doing everything
he can to stop us.

493
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,782
Well, it's too late. When the project
was still in his possession,

494
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,701
Ben cleared every possible hurdle:

495
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,121
the zoning, the impact statements.

496
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:53,585
He was and is
his own worst enemy.

497
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,503
As always. What are you doing?

498
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:59,883
Nothing, Catherine, I'm just
trying a few simple combinations.

499
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,302
- Let me, let me.
- No, Catherine.

500
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,723
Eckhardt's birthday.

501
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,647
My birthday.

502
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,903
The day the gift arrived.

503
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,494
- Ah! Ha, ha. Ah.
- Give it to me.

504
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,584
- Oh, what a bore.
- I opened it.

505
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,925
Oh.

506
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,095
Andrew...

507
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,265
Huh.

508
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,910
I'm not completely prepared for this.

509
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,622
Just think of it as a walking embrace,
all right?

510
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,127
Two people stepping
as one would step.

511
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,840
- So far, so good.
- Now, just follow me.

512
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,468
- We'll follow each other.
- Mm-hm.

513
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,889
- Good.
Mm-hm.

514
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,849
It's genetic memory.

515
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,477
Mom and Dad danced the lindy.

516
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,358
You've got it.

517
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,408
Your body feels nice against mine.

518
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,371
I was just thinking the same thing.

519
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,123
Listen, if I'm being too forward...

520
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:42,170
- I want more than your kisses.
- For instance?

521
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,922
- I want...
- This thing on?

522
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:51,304
Welcome to this final night
of festivities

523
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:56,726
celebrating the Miss Twin Peaks...

524
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:04,692
As some of you...
Damnation, is this damn thing on?

525
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:10,240
What I mean is
I understand why you hesitate,

526
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,784
why you treat me with care.

527
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,912
The convent evokes the image
of helpless women,

528
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,705
fearful of the thought of any emotion

529
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:22,252
other than those derived
from scripture and prayer.

530
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:26,297
But when you hold me,

531
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,591
when we kiss,

532
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,887
I feel safe and eager.

533
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,890
I'm not afraid

534
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:41,020
of anything
that you make me feel or want.

535
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,738
Is this on? Huh? Is this on?

536
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,866
I'm beginning to tire
of his interruptions.

537
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,285
- Welcome to...
- I don't know. I think he's cute.

538
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,746
...this final night of festivities...
- You do?

539
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,082
I think that maybe I will enter after all.

540
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,961
- The Miss Twin Peaks contest?
- Why not?

541
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,298
"Hear the other side.
See the other side."

542
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,426
There's worse places to start
than Miss Twin Peaks.

543
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,553
It's like a fairy tale.

544
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,722
And you're the queen.

545
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:32,405
No.

546
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,588
Huh?

547
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,328
What a gyp.

548
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,038
Finally meet the man of my dreams,

549
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,290
next thing I know,
he's on a plane to Brazil.

550
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,878
He'll be back one day.

551
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,590
- He promised.
- Yeah.

552
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:37,262
Well, he also promised
to take me fishing, and we never did.

553
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,306
Love stinks.

554
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,101
- Fishing?
- Yeah.

555
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,770
Pearl Lake or something.

556
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,691
I have some tackle in the truck.

557
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,318
You do?

558
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:59,534
Audrey, there are many cures
for a broken heart,

559
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:05,290
but nothing quite like
a trout's leap in the moonlight.

560
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,378
May I?

561
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,342
You may.

562
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,398
Jupiter and Saturn meet

563
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:34,068
Oh, what a crop of mummy wheat

564
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:40,325
The planets our babbling major
spoke of are more than distant orbs.

565
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,535
They are, in fact, a clock.

566
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,537
A clock that tells the time.

567
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,788
And the time...

568
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,792
Time draws nearer
with each ticking tock.

569
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,046
Dale wasn't far wrong. The cave
painting is an invitation of sorts,

570
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,131
telling us when the revels begin.

571
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:59,093
But what Dale doesn't know
is where to find it.

572
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:03,306
For, you see, the cave painting
is not only an invitation,

573
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,558
it is also a map.

574
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,852
A map to the Black Lodge!

575
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,371
There's something wrong.

576
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:30,124
This isn't right.
There's something wrong here.
