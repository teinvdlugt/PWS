1
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,065
Agent Cooper.

2
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,819
Can you hear me? It's Andy.

3
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,865
Agent Cooper, it's Andy.

4
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,035
Can you hear me?

5
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,745
Agent Cooper?

6
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,878
Room service.

7
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,729
How are you doing down there?

8
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,403
Warm milk.

9
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,697
Agent Cooper?

10
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,786
Would you put it on the table, please?

11
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,332
- And would you call a doctor?
- Sure.

12
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,252
Are you all right? Can you hear me?

13
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,672
Agent Cooper.

14
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,884
Agent Cooper, it's Andy.
Can you hear me?

15
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,096
Are you all right?

16
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,432
Agent Cooper. Agent Cooper.

17
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,351
Agent Cooper.

18
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,812
It's Andy.

19
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,357
It's An...

20
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,157
I hung it up for you.

21
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,997
What's that?

22
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,750
Hung it up for you.

23
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,045
Did you call the doctor?

24
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,636
The doctor?

25
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,391
It's hung up.

26
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,684
The phone.

27
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,896
Thank you.

28
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,274
Sure.

29
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,027
No problem.

30
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,338
Does this include a gratuity?

31
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,091
Yes, sir.

32
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,564
Thank you. Thank you kindly.

33
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,535
The milk will get cool on you.

34
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,790
- Pretty soon.
- Okay.

35
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,055
I've heard about you.

36
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,341
I heard about you.

37
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,929
I will tell you three things.

38
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,809
If I tell them to you
and they come true,

39
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,229
then will you believe me?

40
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,232
Who's that?

41
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,319
Think of me as a friend.

42
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,282
Where do you come from?

43
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,457
The question is,
where have you gone?

44
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,005
The first thing I will tell you is,

45
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:13,051
there's a man

46
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,680
in a smiling bag.

47
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,476
Man in a smiling bag.

48
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,313
Second thing is,

49
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:30,318
the owls are not what they seem.

50
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,699
Third thing is,

51
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:41,162
without chemicals, he points.

52
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,958
What do these things mean?

53
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,670
This is all I am permitted to say.

54
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,214
Give me your ring.

55
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:57,137
I will return it to you
when you find these things to be true.

56
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,569
We want to help you.

57
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,655
Who's "we"?

58
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,241
One last thing.

59
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:24,372
Leo locked inside hungry horse.

60
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,250
There's a clue at Leo's house.

61
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,342
You will require medical attention.

62
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,330
Knock, knock, knock.

63
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,961
Come on.

64
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,382
Let's have a look at the new girl.

65
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,386
Ow, mm.

66
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,637
Vixen.

67
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,390
What room is Ben in?

68
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,604
The little flower room.

69
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,190
- Why is he holding out on me?
- What?

70
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,611
- Why is he holding out on me?
- What's that, Blackie?

71
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,198
Who's holding out on who?

72
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,868
Please.

73
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,414
Oh, Blackie.

74
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,760
You used to be so pretty.

75
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,725
Blackie, Blackie.

76
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,782
Bastard.

77
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,294
I think you should go now.

78
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,672
- Do you, Prudence?
- Yes, I do. I really do.

79
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,299
Hmm.

80
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,761
All right.

81
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,638
If you insist.

82
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,286
Gotcha. Ha, ha!

83
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,289
I will huff

84
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,792
and puff,

85
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,463
and blow your house down.

86
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,508
Oh, my, my.

87
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:25,178
Aren't you something?

88
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,724
I've got to see you. I must see you.

89
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:34,062
Go away. I'm shy.

90
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,731
Didn't they tell you who I was?

91
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,733
The owner?

92
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,652
That's right.

93
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,738
Ben, it's Jer. We got a situation.

94
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,073
So have I.

95
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,700
Brother Ben, we got a S-N-A-G.

96
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:51,704
- Alas, I do have a situation.
- Come on, Ben.

97
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,331
Coming, Jer.

98
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,458
I like you.

99
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,796
You know how to interest a man.
That's half the battle.

100
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,591
Next time,
we will play a different game.

101
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,135
I'll make the rules.

102
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,681
You'll like it. Fun game.

103
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,352
Everybody wins.

104
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,517
Diane.

105
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,647
My recorder is on the table.

106
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,027
I'm unable to reach it at this time.

107
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,364
I can only hope
that I inadvertently pressed

108
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,742
the voice-activation button.

109
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,746
I'm lying on the floor of my room.

110
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,081
I've been shot.

111
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,879
There's a great deal of pain
and a fair amount of blood.

112
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,926
Fortunately, I was wearing
my bulletproof vest last night,

113
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:32,305
per bureau regulations
when working undercover.

114
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,308
I remember folding the vest up,

115
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,603
trying to chase down a wood tick.

116
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,026
If you can imagine the impact
on your chest

117
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,947
of three bowling balls dropped
from a height of about 9 feet,

118
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,951
you might begin
to approximate the sensation.

119
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,998
All things considered,

120
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:04,045
being shot is not as bad
as I always thought it might be.

121
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,882
As long as you can keep
the fear from your mind.

122
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:14,639
But I guess you could say that
about almost anything in life.

123
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:19,769
It's not so bad as long as you can keep
the fear from your mind.

124
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,907
Oh, my God.

125
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,535
The ring is gone.

126
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,879
At a time like this, curiously,

127
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,633
you begin to think
of the things you regret

128
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,261
or the things you might miss.

129
00:16:55,431 --> 00:17:00,601
I would like, in general, to treat people
with much more care and respect.

130
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,564
I would like to climb a tall hill.

131
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,983
Not too tall.

132
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,736
Sit in the cool grass.

133
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,946
Not too cool.

134
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,241
And feel the sun on my face.

135
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:21,581
I wish I could have cracked
the Lindbergh kidnapping case.

136
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,586
I would very much like
to make love to a beautiful woman

137
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,881
who I had genuine affection for.

138
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:36,888
And of course, it goes without saying
that I would like to visit Tibet.

139
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:41,934
I wish they could get their country back
and the Dalai Lama could return.

140
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,271
Oh, I would like that very much.

141
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,195
All in all,
a very interesting experience.

142
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,037
They're here.

143
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,171
My skin was itching.

144
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,883
Wood tick was crawling.

145
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,679
I lifted my bulletproof vest.

146
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,515
Three slugs.

147
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,142
Point-blank range.

148
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,811
That explains this.

149
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,608
Hell of a way to kill a tick.

150
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,446
Did you get a look at the gunman?

151
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:44,163
I saw a masked face, muzzle flash.

152
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:52,004
Lucy, you better bring Agent Cooper
up-to-date.

153
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,884
Leo Johnson was shot.

154
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,387
Jacques Renault was strangled.

155
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,266
The mill burned.
Shelly and Pete got smoke inhalation.

156
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,601
Catherine and Josie are missing.

157
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,647
Nadine is in a coma
from taking sleeping pills.

158
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,405
- How long have I been out?
- It's 7:45 in the morning.

159
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,699
We haven't had this much action
in one night

160
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,285
since the Elk's Club fire of '59.

161
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:28,374
Harry, we need to get a search warrant
for Leo Johnson's house.

162
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,545
No need. Leo was shot
in his own living room.

163
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,174
Deputy Brennan found him.

164
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,640
- You're not going anywhere.
- Doc. When the will is invoked,

165
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:48,769
the recuperative powers of the physical
body are simply extraordinary.

166
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,779
Just give me a couple of hours
to get dressed.

167
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,963
I'm standing just in front of
where a massive log-storage area

168
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,758
of the Packard Saw Mill
burned to the ground,

169
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,844
under what fire department
investigators are calling

170
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,763
"mysterious circumstances."

171
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,851
Now, police officials have
told me that they have, as of yet,

172
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,395
- Bobby.
- uncovered no apparent link

173
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,439
between these two
seemingly unrelated

174
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,066
- Bobby.
- tragedies.

175
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,568
Reporting live
from the Packard Saw Mill...

176
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,321
Cooper, this is totally against
my recommendations.

177
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,031
It's all right, doc. Duly noted.

178
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,700
You got two busted ribs,
your cartilage is a mess.

179
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,286
Who knows what else is wrong?

180
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,331
What's that?

181
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,834
Jacques Renault.

182
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,379
Is that bag smiling?

183
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,882
Smiling?

184
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,262
What's there to smile about?

185
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,142
Do you miss Beth?

186
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,686
What?

187
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,774
Have you been missing your mom?

188
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,114
- Aunt Sarah?
- Yeah?

189
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,617
I had the strangest dream last night.

190
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,661
About what?

191
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,209
The rug.

192
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,418
Right here.

193
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,464
Right from this angle
where I'm sitting.

194
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,800
Was Laura in it?

195
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,969
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats

196
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:12,556
And liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?

197
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,476
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And liddle lamzy divey

198
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,561
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?

199
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,648
Now, if the words sound queer
And funny to your ear

200
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,691
A little bit jumbled and jivey

201
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,820
Say, "Mares eat oats
And does eat oats

202
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:30,741
And little lambs eat ivy"

203
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,326
Leland?

204
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:36,747
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And liddle lamzy divey

205
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:48,676
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?

206
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,138
Morning, dears.

207
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,889
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats

208
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,057
And liddle lamzy divey

209
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,559
Oh, Leland.

210
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,436
Uncle Leland's hair turned white.

211
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,522
Leland, come back here.

212
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,587
Oh, God.

213
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,719
Okay. Agenda.

214
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,596
One.

215
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,556
I want a location on Catherine.

216
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,685
Keep our distance, just make sure
she's ready to take the fall.

217
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,187
Two.

218
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,606
I want a complete medical
on Leo Johnson

219
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,399
and his prospects for recovery

220
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:49,195
and a satisfactory explanation
from Hank Jennings

221
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:53,616
why Leo isn't being measured
for a plot in Ghostwood Memorial Park.

222
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,619
Well begun is half done.

223
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,704
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats

224
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:02,208
And liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?

225
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,252
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And liddle lamzy divey

226
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,546
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?

227
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,883
Now, if the words sound queer
And funny to your ear

228
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,511
A little bit jumbled and jivey

229
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:17,556
Say, "Mares eat oats
And does eat oats

230
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:21,810
And little lambs eat ivy"

231
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,065
I'm back.

232
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,442
Back and ready.

233
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,826
But the bullet came from outside.

234
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,248
How do you figure?

235
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,917
Sheriff, a picture is forming.

236
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,795
Big ax on the couch.

237
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,006
These same geese were flying
that evening.

238
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,551
Leo was trying to turn someone
into kindling.

239
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,511
That person hit the TV, moved it.

240
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,013
You can see the depression
in the carpet.

241
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,599
Shelly?

242
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,310
Shelly Johnson's about 99 pounds
soaking wet.

243
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,187
This is a big TV.

244
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,606
Leo advanced, ax raised.

245
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,942
Then what happened?

246
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,988
Bullet came through the window,
knocked Leo back onto the couch.

247
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,116
Do you think it was Shelly
who pulled the trigger?

248
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,911
Sheriff, get your mind off Shelly,
for a moment.

249
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,206
We won't know about Shelly until we
find out what time she got to the mill.

250
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,838
Surprise. Flesh World.

251
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,881
Hey, what issue is this?

252
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,634
Still no cocaine. Here or in the truck.

253
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,344
But I found this in the truck.

254
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,513
Leo's duster.

255
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,517
- Reeks of gasoline.
- The mill.

256
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,730
Good work, Hawk.

257
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,073
Harry, do you know who it is?

258
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,159
Harry, do you know who it is?

259
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,119
- Harry.
- What's that?

260
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,039
- Harry, do you know who it is?
- It's Andy.

261
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,999
He seems pretty upset
about something.

262
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,961
Harry, it's Agent Rosenflower.

263
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,686
Andy, are you all right?

264
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,983
Hey, Andy.

265
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,610
Are you all right?

266
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,838
And it's another great moment
in law enforcement history.

267
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,524
Hey, Albert.

268
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,569
Looks like you were more right
than you know.

269
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:25,160
Looks like a new pair of boots
and a lot of cocaine.

270
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,709
Andy.

271
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,296
Good work.

272
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,483
Hot damn that pie is good!

273
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,796
Here's Laura's glasses
that you wanted.

274
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:52,748
Thanks.

275
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,009
Donna, do you see these glasses
that I'm wearing?

276
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,677
Yeah.

277
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,020
I hate them.

278
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,316
I'm never wearing these again.

279
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,737
Okay.

280
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,163
Is it true about James?

281
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,296
He spent the night in jail.

282
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,008
Do you think
it's because of what we did?

283
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,971
Look, we don't know
if we did anything.

284
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:52,850
My dad said Jacoby got sick
because he was attacked.

285
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,935
All we did was send him a tape.

286
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,981
Maybe he wouldn't have been attacked
if we hadn't.

287
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,900
Maybe. Maybe the sun won't come
up tomorrow if you wash your hair.

288
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:05,153
Think like that and you're gonna
go crazy. What's done is done.

289
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,825
The only way this won't come back
to haunt us

290
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,786
is if we keep quiet
about what happened last night.

291
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:18,000
I can assure you
James is doing the same thing.

292
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:23,839
Get the picture?

293
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,092
Loud and clear.

294
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:37,853
Uncle Leland's hair turned white.

295
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,399
Really?

296
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,736
White as a sheet.

297
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,615
Weird.

298
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,578
Donna, I have something for you.

299
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,539
Came here to the Double R
yesterday.

300
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,792
Thanks, Norma.

301
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,350
- God.
- What is it?

302
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,944
"Look into the Meals on Wheels."

303
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,312
How simple can I make it, Cooper?

304
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,898
FBI agent gets shot,
FBI agent investigates.

305
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,443
I'm in proximity, work in the Seattle lab,
I'm familiar with the underlying case.

306
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,862
- Ugh! Yes.
- Does that hurt?

307
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,783
Albert, the point is, you're not gonna
win any local popularity contests.

308
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,412
No, the point is
Gordon Cole ordered me back here.

309
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,165
Breathe.

310
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,421
Again.

311
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,341
Okay.

312
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,804
You were shot by a right-handed
person, 5'6 "to 5'10" tall,

313
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,016
at a distance of less than 3 feet.
I'll have ballistics this afternoon.

314
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,601
- You're still blank on the other details?
- Yes.

315
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,021
What was your vest doing
riding up like that?

316
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,731
Wood tick.

317
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:50,652
Meanwhile, one of your principle
suspects is killed in his hospital bed,

318
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,654
the other is shot in his living room.

319
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,157
Vigilante justice
or just clean country living?

320
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,202
Albert, where does this attitude of
general unpleasantness come from?

321
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,204
I'll have to get back to you on that.

322
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,498
If you don't want two black eyes
on a regular basis,

323
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:06,501
I suggest you make
some kind of peace with rural life.

324
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:10,130
Great. After the square dance,
maybe we can all take a hayride.

325
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,924
Come in.

326
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,304
Andy, how's the nose?

327
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,515
Not a mark on it,
only blood squirted out.

328
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,476
Where do they keep his water dish?

329
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,187
Albert.

330
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,440
Agent Cooper, guess what.

331
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,234
I have the answer to the riddle
that you told me this morning.

332
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,737
I called Hungry Horse, Montana.

333
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,781
The word "locked."

334
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:40,744
Leo Johnson was locked in a jail
in Hungry Horse, Montana.

335
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,205
When, Andy?

336
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:55,342
"February 9, 1988."

337
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,930
Teresa Banks.

338
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:05,685
Looks like Leo has an alibi for the night
Teresa Banks was murdered.

339
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,356
Good work, Andy.

340
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,983
Yeah. Woof.

341
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,470
Excuse me.

342
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,393
- Is Sheriff Truman here?
- He is, but he is busy at the moment.

343
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,896
May I help you?

344
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,110
I'm afraid
I don't have an appointment.

345
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,904
The sheriff asked me to stop by

346
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,157
at my convenience.

347
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,159
This is the first convenient moment.
Heh.

348
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,037
May I ask what this is regarding?

349
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,960
I'm here to sell him some shoes.

350
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,684
Shoes?

351
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,687
Uh-oh. Here comes Mom

352
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,898
with milk and cookies.

353
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,774
Later, Lawrence.

354
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,568
Bye-bye.

355
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,699
You got this tape
from Dr. Jacoby's office?

356
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,034
Yeah.

357
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,453
That's breaking and entering, James.

358
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,913
The door was open.

359
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,123
How did you know
Jacoby wouldn't be there?

360
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,584
I knocked, nobody answered.

361
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,546
- You were alone?
- Yeah.

362
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,177
Okay. I know you were trying to help,

363
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,930
but there's some people
who might not see it that way.

364
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,058
Especially with 3 ounces of cocaine
in your gas tank.

365
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,101
You know I didn't put that there.

366
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,646
I think it was probably
Mike and Bobby.

367
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,814
- Yeah.
- Harry,

368
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,609
Laura talks on her tape
about a mystery man.

369
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,403
A red Corvette. Leo Johnson.

370
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,114
I think it was somebody else.
Not Jacques Renault either.

371
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,824
Why do you say that?

372
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,202
I never put it together
until I heard the tape.

373
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,038
Where she says,
"This guy can really light my fire."

374
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,918
Well, I remember this one night when
we first started seeing each other.

375
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,711
She was still doing drugs then.

376
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,841
Well, we were in the woods and
she started saying this scary poem,

377
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,135
over and over, about fire.

378
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,346
And then she said:

379
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,307
"Would you like to play with fire,
little boy?"

380
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:55,313
"Would you like to play with Bob?"

381
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,860
- What did she mean by that?
- I don't know.

382
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,780
Laura said a lot of nutty stuff.

383
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,534
Half the time,
it just went right by you.

384
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,286
This stuck, though.

385
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,128
James, I'll get right to the point.

386
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,172
I know you have the other half
of Laura Palmer's necklace.

387
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,925
I want it. Give it to me.

388
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,928
How?

389
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,100
Well, this was in Jacoby's office.

390
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,565
It was in a coconut.

391
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,318
A coconut?

392
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,489
Hawk, take James back to his cell.

393
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,619
Jacoby?

394
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:55,165
How did you know
he had the necklace?

395
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,625
Laura and James were in love.

396
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,503
I figured he had to have
the other half of the necklace,

397
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,047
but if he had the other half,

398
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:05,175
he would have given it to us
to help with the case.

399
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,427
Then it dawned on me.

400
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,972
Something or someone
frightened him off.

401
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,808
He had to have it,
so I asked him for it.

402
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,227
Jacoby?

403
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:21,274
I didn't figure he had anything
to do with this at all.

404
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,445
Sometimes you just get lucky.

405
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,513
Donna?

406
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,058
Hi, Lucy.

407
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,940
I'm here to see James.

408
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,015
How are you doing?

409
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,769
Did you tell them anything?

410
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,022
They haven't asked me anything.

411
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,986
When did you start smoking?

412
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,200
I smoke every once in a while.

413
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,662
Helps relieve tension.

414
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,748
When did you get so tense?

415
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,085
When I started smoking.

416
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,797
Did you tell them anything?

417
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,134
I didn't tell them about you or Maddy.

418
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,179
Do they think Leo killed Laura?

419
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,931
I don't know what they think.

420
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,600
How is Maddy?

421
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,814
She's fine.

422
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,776
She hasn't said anything either.

423
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,119
So don't you wanna kiss me?

424
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,049
What's wrong?

425
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,510
Nothing's wrong.

426
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,107
Or is it just not okay
for me to want you?

427
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:15,156
Get out soon, James.

428
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,027
Lucy.

429
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,738
Andy.

430
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,785
In these boxes
is every edition of Flesh World

431
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,830
published for the past three years.

432
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,624
This is a picture of Teresa Banks,
the first victim,

433
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:10,295
who was found murdered a year ago
in the southern part of the state.

434
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:13,965
Now, Laura and Ronette's photographs
appeared in ads in the magazines.

435
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:18,469
You want us to look for a picture
of Teresa Banks.

436
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,847
Andy, you're way ahead of me.

437
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,142
Lucy, Sheriff Truman and I
will be at the hospital.

438
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,060
Behave yourselves.

439
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,649
Diane, just received the back issues
of Flesh World. Good work.

440
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,651
It's nice to see some cooperation
with the law,

441
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,779
especially from a company
that preys on human weaknesses.

442
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:45,371
Lucy, I sure feel uncomfortable
being in this situation with you.

443
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,208
Why? We're both professionals.

444
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,679
Is he on something?

445
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,557
Only what you prescribed.

446
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:13,066
I think he did take
a little bit of his food.

447
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,735
My God, could that be it?

448
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,414
Agent Cooper.

449
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,208
Why don't you tell the psychiatrist

450
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,753
about your broken ribs
and torn cartilage.

451
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,717
Well, well, well.

452
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:44,889
What happened to you?

453
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,437
I don't want any baloney, magic tricks
or psychological mumbo jumbo.

454
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,816
I want you to tell us
how you came into possession of this

455
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:59,779
or I am gonna have to place you
under arrest for obstruction of justice.

456
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,664
Look, I told you.

457
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:13,626
The night after Laura died,
I followed a man in a red Corvette.

458
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,503
Leo Johnson.

459
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,756
Correct.

460
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:24,137
Then he eluded me somewhere
near the old sawmill road.

461
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:28,641
As I sat there, cursing my...

462
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,853
My lack of horsepower,

463
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,564
a motorcycle drove by.

464
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,192
Followed by a police cruiser.

465
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,111
But you lost them.

466
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,780
They went into the woods.

467
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:47,744
I saw them.
I followed them in there on foot.

468
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,290
- James and Donna?
- Yes, they...

469
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:56,043
They spoke intently for a while, but
I couldn't hear what they were saying.

470
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,797
I remember it was...

471
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,800
It was a cold night in the woods.

472
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,636
Finally, they...

473
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,223
They buried something in the ground,
under a rock.

474
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,733
Ill-advisedly, perhaps,

475
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,902
I took it as a keepsake.

476
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,868
It was her, you see.

477
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,121
The necklace.

478
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,457
A divided heart.

479
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,669
Laura was...

480
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,921
Was, in fact...

481
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,465
Well, she was living a double life.

482
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,383
Two people.

483
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,720
Yeah, but then...

484
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:54,060
Then when I saw her
that last time, she...

485
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,605
I don't know, she seemed
to have reached a kind of...

486
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,899
A peace with herself.

487
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,860
Now I believe that

488
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,030
what she had in fact arrived at

489
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,658
was a decision to end her life.

490
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,453
Are you saying Laura wanted to die?

491
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,788
Doctor,

492
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,458
Laura Palmer did not
commit suicide.

493
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,961
No, no.

494
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:25,049
But maybe she allowed herself
to be killed.

495
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,108
One more thing.

496
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,903
You were in intensive care last night
when Jacques Renault was killed.

497
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,907
Yeah, yes.
But I mean, come on, fellows.

498
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,076
I was heavily sedated and...

499
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,871
Did you see anything?
Hear anything?

500
00:47:55,038 --> 00:48:00,459
I remember hearing
a fire alarm go off, but...

501
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,548
It's...

502
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,175
It's all like a...

503
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,845
Like a dream.

504
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,642
There was a smell.

505
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:22,565
Yeah, there was a peculiar smell.

506
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:28,446
It's usual in case of strangulation
for the victim to void his bowels.

507
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,414
No.

508
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,917
No, that wasn't it, this...

509
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,880
This was a smell like...

510
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,425
Like oil.

511
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,807
Scorched engine oil.

512
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,772
Dr. Bradley, call the operator.

513
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,609
Dr. Bradley,
call the operator, please.

514
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,050
Hey, sleeping beauty.

515
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,595
Bobby.

516
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,982
What are you doing here?
What if someone sees you?

517
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:51,237
I don't care. I do not care anymore.

518
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,615
Leo's in the hospital.

519
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,283
Somebody shot him.

520
00:49:56,451 --> 00:50:01,580
Yeah, I know. I mean,
I heard there's cops outside his room.

521
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:05,042
- Really?
- I hear they're gonna bust him.

522
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,838
He must have got caught
doing something, poor bastard.

523
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,093
What happened to you?

524
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:19,682
Bobby, I'm so afraid.

525
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,393
Leo tried to kill me.

526
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,062
He knows about us.

527
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,275
He took me up to the mill,

528
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:32,611
and he tied me up
and started the fire.

529
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,906
Bobby,

530
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:38,034
he told me he was gonna kill you.

531
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,995
Fat chance.

532
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,540
I won't let him hurt us anymore.

533
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,464
Are you all right?

534
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,343
Doctors seem to think so.

535
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:04,060
You know, Shelly,
hospitals are dangerous places.

536
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,396
First of all, they're crawling
with sick people.

537
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,816
And second of all,
that food can kill you.

538
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,738
So if you wanna
get out of here pronto,

539
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,033
you're gonna have to let Bobby
be your doctor.

540
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:25,414
So let's just have a look here,
Miss Shelly.

541
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:33,798
Oh, you seem to be
coming along splendidly.

542
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,468
Deep breath.

543
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:45,684
I'd say you're on your way
to a complete recovery.

544
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,823
You better go.

545
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,410
You're my girl.

546
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,456
Bobby.

547
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,419
I love you.

548
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:21,554
I guess I love you too.

549
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,905
Yeah, I guess I love you too.

550
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,333
Bobby Briggs.

551
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,965
- What's he doing here?
- He doesn't look sick.

552
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,260
Sheriff Truman, to see this kind
of investigative genius at work,

553
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,512
it's just a real treat for me.

554
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,186
Ed.

555
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,482
How are you doing?
I heard you stopped a couple.

556
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,694
I'm okay. How's Nadine?

557
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,155
Well, she's in a coma.

558
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:24,116
They say there's nothing we could do.
She has to wanna come back.

559
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,868
How are you holding up?

560
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,245
Well, all I can do is sit here,

561
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,998
thinking about the things
I should have said or done.

562
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,709
Ed, don't be too hard on yourself.

563
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,588
I never believed in fate,
Agent Cooper.

564
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,006
I always felt

565
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,885
you make your own way, you take care
of your own, you pick up after yourself.

566
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,387
Farmer's Almanac?

567
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,307
Albert, I would like to speak to Ed.

568
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,435
Albert, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

569
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,148
Take a seat, Ed.

570
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,153
I saw this coming.

571
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,030
I didn't wanna believe it.

572
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,492
What's worse is I'm sitting thinking
that maybe there's a part of me

573
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,036
that didn't wanna stop her.

574
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,913
And that's a full load.

575
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,416
When did you get married, Ed?

576
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,835
Right out of high school.

577
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,171
Norma and I had been together
about four years.

578
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:23,425
Everybody figured we'd get hitched.
That'd be that.

579
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:26,095
I barely knew Nadine to say hello to.

580
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,890
That spring, one bad weekend,

581
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,559
Norma ran off with Hank.

582
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,020
I was so twisted up inside,
I couldn't see straight.

583
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,023
When I opened my eyes,

584
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,901
there was Nadine,
right in front of me.

585
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,363
There was something so sweet,

586
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:47,032
so helpless about her.

587
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:49,910
We drove all night.

588
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:54,498
Ended up in some little town
in Montana, out past Great Falls,

589
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,000
and I asked her to marry me.

590
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:02,214
Half joking, half drunk, half crazy.

591
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,675
It was light before we found
a justice of the peace.

592
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,011
And Norma...

593
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,097
Well, she hadn't even
slept with Hank.

594
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,183
The look on her face
when she found out...

595
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:19,940
Nadine and I, we went up to my dad's
old cabin up in Eagle Pass.

596
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,234
Honeymoon.

597
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,154
I was hoping maybe we'd get around
to talking about a divorce,

598
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,240
annulment, something.

599
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,909
But Nadine was so happy.

600
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,955
And you know, by golly,

601
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,583
I shot out Nadine's eye
on that honeymoon.

602
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,086
What do you mean, Ed?

603
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,381
The first day,
we were hunting pheasant.

604
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:48,260
Nadine's a crack shot
and we already had a couple of birds.

605
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,262
And I felt good shooting.

606
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:54,600
Listening to the sound echoing,
roll down those hills.

607
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,143
I fired.

608
00:55:56,311 --> 00:56:00,189
A piece of buckshot skipped off a rock
and caught Nadine square in the eye.

609
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,858
Man, that's a tough one.

610
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,277
She laid across my lap
as we drove back to town.

611
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,822
She never cried.

612
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,367
She never blamed me.

613
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,203
She never hated me for it.

614
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,874
Couple of months later,
Norma married Hank.

615
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:23,045
So I don't believe in fate.
You make your bed, you sleep in it.

616
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,173
Sorry.

617
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,593
Ed, someone here to see you.

618
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,244
A man in a smiling bag.

619
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,882
Take James right back to the station
when you're done here.

620
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,010
Poor Ed.

621
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,138
Poor Nadine.

622
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,474
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

623
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,935
Albert, why don't you
take this opportunity

624
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,521
to check in at The Great Northern?

625
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:33,532
Nurse, I really mean it,
you better speak to that kitchen.

626
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,638
Harry, when Albert finishes up
at The Great Northern,

627
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,223
we'll meet back at the station.

628
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,851
I'm ready to lay the whole thing out.

629
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,227
Rocks and bottles?

630
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:05,230
Chalk and blackboard
will be just fine.

631
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,775
- Jelly doughnuts?
- Harry, that goes without saying.

632
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:11,987
I'll come back later
and I'll bring some soup.

633
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,073
The food in these places will kill you
quicker than most diseases.

634
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,242
Heh. So I hear.

635
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,369
Now, you know
I have a sweet tooth too.

636
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,206
I've got
a chocolate-peanut butter pie.

637
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,833
Norma, I'm serious.

638
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,294
Bring the whole pie.

639
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,506
I'll bring you two.

640
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,508
Okay.

641
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,512
- Feel better, sweetie.
- Bye.

642
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,223
Bye.

643
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,910
Son.

644
00:59:45,581 --> 00:59:47,207
Dad.

645
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:51,628
Would you

646
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,797
care to join me?

647
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,510
Okay.

648
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,318
How was school today?

649
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,697
School?

650
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,159
Fine.

651
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,786
That's good.

652
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,958
How was work?

653
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,003
Work? Work was good.

654
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,430
- Dad?
- Yes, son?

655
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,769
What is it that you do, exactly?

656
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:52,356
That's classified.

657
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:54,775
Oh.

658
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:01,156
Bobby, would you care
for a piece of pie?

659
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,910
The huckleberries are particularly
delicious today.

660
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,788
Particularly fresh and delicious.

661
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,083
No, thanks.

662
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,133
Bobby,

663
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,261
may I share something with you?

664
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,014
Okay.

665
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:29,559
A vision I had in my sleep last night.

666
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,104
As distinguished from a dream,

667
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:34,523
which is mere sorting
and cataloging

668
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:37,609
of the day's events
by the subconscious.

669
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,987
This was a vision.

670
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:44,408
Fresh and clear
as a mountain stream.

671
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:48,453
The mind revealing itself to itself.

672
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,998
In my vision,

673
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:55,877
I was on the veranda
of a vast estate,

674
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,923
a palazzo
of some fantastic proportion.

675
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:04,219
There seemed to emanate from it
a light from within this

676
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,848
gleaming, radiant marble.

677
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:13,228
I'd known this place. I had, in fact,
been born and raised there.

678
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,981
This was my first return.

679
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:22,863
A reunion with the deepest
wellsprings of my being.

680
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,367
Wandering about, I noticed happily

681
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:31,079
that the house had been
immaculately maintained.

682
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,583
There had been added a number
of additional rooms,

683
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:40,630
but in a way that blended so seamlessly
with the original construction

684
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:44,134
one would never detect
any difference.

685
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:47,804
Returning to the house's
grand foyer,

686
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,640
there came a knock at the door.

687
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,769
My son was standing there.

688
01:02:56,355 --> 01:03:00,233
He was happy and carefree.

689
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:05,614
Clearly living a life
of deep harmony and joy.

690
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,243
We embraced.

691
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:14,080
A warm and loving embrace,
nothing withheld.

692
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:19,377
We were, in this moment, one.

693
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:32,849
My vision ended and I awoke
with a tremendous feeling

694
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:36,937
of optimism and confidence

695
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:38,772
in you and your future.

696
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,567
That was my vision of you.

697
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:45,570
Really?

698
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:51,618
I'm so glad to have had this opportunity
to share it with you.

699
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:05,507
I wish you nothing
but the very best in all things.

700
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,842
Thank you, Dad.

701
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:11,263
- See you later. Call.
- Okay.

702
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,439
Major?

703
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,650
How was the pie?

704
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,360
Exceptional, as always.

705
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,170
How is Shelly?

706
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,173
I can't talk right now.

707
01:04:48,884 --> 01:04:51,219
Well, how did she like the flowers?

708
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:26,379
The night Laura Palmer was killed, it
appears she made two appointments.

709
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:29,591
In her diary she had written,
"Nervous about meeting J tonight."

710
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,968
I now believe this was a reference
to James Hurley.

711
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,054
She was nervous
because she planned to tell him

712
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:35,680
she didn't wanna see him anymore.

713
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:38,391
Before she snuck out of the house,
she received a phone call.

714
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,019
We believe it was Leo Johnson
making the second appointment

715
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,729
for sometime later that night.

716
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,607
Laura met James,
was with him until 12:30,

717
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,234
when, at the intersection
of Sparkwood and 21,

718
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:50,695
she jumped from the bike
and ran into the woods.

719
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:53,239
We believe she met up there
with Jacques Renault,

720
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,700
Leo Johnson and Ronette Pulaski.

721
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,870
Together, they drove to the foot
of the trail leading to Jacques' cabin.

722
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:02,707
They climbed the trail, they were heard
passing by the cabin of the Log Lady.

723
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,710
They reached Jacques Renault's cabin
at approximately 1 a.m.

724
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,380
Drugs and alcohol were consumed.
Laura was tied up

725
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:11,007
and had sexual relations
with both Leo and Jacques.

726
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:13,551
Waldo the bird was let out of his cage
and attacked Laura.

727
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:16,554
Leo and Jacques fought.
Jacques went outside and passed out.

728
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:19,057
When he came to,
Leo and the girls were gone.

729
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,477
We believe Leo hiked back down
the trail to his Corvette alone,

730
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,104
leaving the girls behind.

731
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:26,523
The reason being,
there was a third man.

732
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,608
Deputy Hawk found
evidence of a third man

733
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,819
outside the window
of Jacques' cabin.

734
01:06:30,986 --> 01:06:33,196
The third man took Laura
and Ronette to the train

735
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:34,364
where they were tied up.

736
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,449
Laura for the second time,
Ronette for the first.

737
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:38,660
Using a blunt object,
the killer hit Ronette

738
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,203
and knocked her unconscious.

739
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,330
He must have been so intent
on killing Laura,

740
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:45,917
he didn't realize that Ronette
regained consciousness and escaped.

741
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,545
Either he didn't know or he didn't care.

742
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,714
He made a small mound of dirt

743
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:53,258
and put the half-heart necklace
of Laura's on top.

744
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:57,887
He then placed a small cut out letter R
under the nail of her left ring finger.

745
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:02,350
You'll recall that he placed the letter T
under the fingernail of Teresa Banks.

746
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:06,479
He left a note written in blood,
"Fire walk with me."

747
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:08,148
Here's the interesting thing.

748
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:11,067
The blood on the note was tested.
It doesn't match Leo's,

749
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:13,445
Jacques', Laura's or Ronette's.

750
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:16,698
So we surmise the killer
wrote the note in his own blood.

751
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,492
It's a rare type, AB negative.

752
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:23,288
The towel that Deputy Hawk found
five miles down the tracks

753
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,039
was soaked in blood of that type.

754
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:29,043
He also found, near the towel,
scraps of faded paper.

755
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,379
These scraps may have
been left by the killer.

756
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,090
They'll be sent back
to Washington, D.C., for testing.

757
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:48,688
I know, Andy.
I know, I know, I know.

758
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,733
It's what we call
a real three-hankie crime.

759
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,617
Albert Rozerfeld,

760
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:05,163
I don't like the way you talk smart
about Sheriff Truman or anybody.

761
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,123
You just shut your mouth!

762
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,894
Laura Palmer is dead.

763
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,271
Jacques Renault is dead.

764
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:34,067
Ronette Pulaski and Leo Johnson
are in comas.

765
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,444
Waldo the bird is dead.

766
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:40,740
This leaves only the third man.

767
01:08:56,966 --> 01:09:01,344
- You want this door closed?
- Yeah, yeah. We'll frost our rooms.

768
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:03,763
Oh.

769
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:07,684
- I sure do appreciate the ride, Harry.
- No problem.

770
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:10,478
I always appreciate
your company, Pete.

771
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,480
Oh.

772
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:19,153
Boy, this smoke inhalation
is nasty business.

773
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:26,786
I feel like somebody taped my lips
to the tailpipe of a bus.

774
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:36,254
Take her easy.

775
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:44,053
- So where the hell is Josie?
- Oh, well, maybe this will tell us.

776
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,603
"Dear Pete,

777
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:55,315
I had to leave the town

778
01:09:55,482 --> 01:10:01,321
on an emergency
of business to Seattle.

779
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:05,658
I will phone you when I arrive.

780
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:09,495
Hope you did a good day
at the mill.

781
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:16,169
There is ginger beer in the refrig.
Love, Josie." There you go.

782
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:19,005
- Is there a phone number in there?
- No.

783
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:22,550
- Does she say where she's staying?
- No, no, she goes off to Seattle

784
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:26,596
once every three months or so.

785
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:32,602
You want my opinion, I think she goes
over there to indulge a secret vice.

786
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:36,064
- What's that?
- Shopping.

787
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:38,483
Comes back
with half a department store.

788
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:54,916
Pete,

789
01:10:56,251 --> 01:10:58,544
we haven't found Catherine.

790
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:02,590
Yeah.

791
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,802
I figured.

792
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:09,847
I know you wanna hope for the best,

793
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,308
but you ought to prepare
for the worst.

794
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,520
Oh, dear.

795
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:23,277
I always figured
I'd be the one to go first.

796
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:26,155
I mean, if you was laying odds

797
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:29,951
on the last person standing
after an atomic war,

798
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,828
I'd have bet on her.

799
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:38,001
Yeah, she was a tiger, all right.

800
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:40,962
Ah, no use mincing words.

801
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:45,299
She was plain hell to live with.

802
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:48,845
Plain hell.

803
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,349
But

804
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:58,563
once, there was a little bit
of heaven there too.

805
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:01,357
Oh, I'm sure there was.

806
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:03,609
Oh, God.

807
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,864
This will take a little while
to sink in, I suppose.

808
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,491
I suppose it will.

809
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,957
God help her miserable soul.

810
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,918
I loved her.

811
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,308
Blue Pine Lodge.

812
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,602
Could I speak to Josie Packard,
please?

813
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:41,272
- Well, she's not here right now.
- Can you tell me when she'll be back?

814
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,608
Well, she's out of town.
Who's calling?

815
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:55,953
I'd like to place
an international call, please.

816
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,915
Collect to Hong Kong.

817
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,336
Doesn't that sound?

818
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:06,130
I mean, I ate it,
but I didn't really know what it was.

819
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:08,174
I read about it
in this French magazine,

820
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:13,679
and they take the entire head and dip it
in a kind of blancmange pudding.

821
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:18,768
And then they roll it in oats and stuff it
full of walnuts and hot rocks

822
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,978
- and a spice cookie.
- Mr. Horne, Mr. Horne.

823
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,523
- They wrap it in papillon.
- Mr. Horne, Mr. Horne.

824
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:24,899
They seal the edges

825
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,944
- with a sugar glaze...
- Mm.

826
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,279
- ...and bake it under glass.
- Mr. Horne, Mr. Horne.

827
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:31,989
Ah. That sounds incredible.

828
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:35,576
It is to die for.

829
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:39,372
Have you seen Audrey today?

830
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,499
No, I haven't.

831
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,345
Hank Jennings.

832
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:57,348
Jerry and Benjamin Horne.

833
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,483
Where's Josie?

834
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:09,777
She left last night.

835
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,115
Prearranged?

836
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:18,536
She wanted to put a little distance
between her and the smell of smoke.

837
01:14:19,454 --> 01:14:21,747
Sound strategy.

838
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,668
Next business, Leo Johnson.

839
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,879
He's in a coma.

840
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:29,797
Looks like brain damage.

841
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:33,176
With Leo, how could they tell?

842
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:37,054
Why isn't he dead?

843
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:41,184
I caught him center shot with a.44.

844
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:43,311
Couldn't risk going inside.

845
01:14:43,478 --> 01:14:47,231
Neighborhood was hot.
I had to sneak past patrols as it was.

846
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:49,025
Anybody see you?

847
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:51,194
Negative.

848
01:14:51,361 --> 01:14:53,905
He was chopping wood.

849
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:56,699
Chopping wood? Inside?

850
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,784
- Yeah, you know Leo.
- Wait a minute.

851
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:02,205
- Chopping wood inside?
- Yeah.

852
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:04,165
You know Leo.

853
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:09,378
All right. What's next?

854
01:15:09,796 --> 01:15:11,631
Catherine.

855
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:15,259
Dead?

856
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:19,222
My phone call put her in the drying
shed when the place went up.

857
01:15:19,389 --> 01:15:22,141
Sounds like buried
with the wreckage.

858
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:26,812
Heat like that,
they'll be lucky to find teeth.

859
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:30,566
And they were such pretty teeth.

860
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:35,238
Marvelous.

861
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,698
Gentlemen,

862
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:42,078
if they don't hang the arson
on the late lamented Catherine

863
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:45,665
and her coconspirator Leo,

864
01:15:45,832 --> 01:15:47,750
I'll give up sex.

865
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:52,546
That's confidence.

866
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:56,842
What do we do with the ledger?

867
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,135
Hank,

868
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:03,099
you leave the creative thinking
to the brothers Horne.

869
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:06,936
You're a bicep.
Relax until we say, "Flex."

870
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:14,402
Now, that really makes me mad.

871
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:25,454
You guys. Ha-ha-ha.

872
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:34,130
Come in.

873
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:58,612
Why is the door to my room locked?

874
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,699
And who's the refrigerator?

875
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:09,665
The owner was a little disappointed
in your performance last night.

876
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:17,590
Well, the owner isn't exactly my type.

877
01:17:35,942 --> 01:17:38,611
And what is your type exactly?

878
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:45,659
Not you. No offense.

879
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,292
Hey.

880
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:58,339
Let's get one thing straight
between us, princess.

881
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:01,592
Okay.

882
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,804
I don't wanna hear another complaint
about you.

883
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:06,472
When you work for me,

884
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:09,225
everybody's your type.

885
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,243
Norma?

886
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,329
Hi, it's Donna.

887
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:34,583
I'm calling about Meals on Wheels.

888
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:39,088
I'm gonna take over Laura's route
if that's okay with you.

889
01:18:41,007 --> 01:18:42,716
Okay.

890
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:45,177
Great.

891
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:49,557
Listen, can I use the Double R
station wagon?

892
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,102
All right.

893
01:18:54,938 --> 01:18:56,439
Great.

894
01:18:57,482 --> 01:18:59,692
Then I'll see you tomorrow at 9.

895
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:14,707
Gersten's gonna tell us
about tonight's proceedings.

896
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:18,919
She has some very good news.
We're all very proud of her.

897
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:20,129
Good evening.

898
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:22,965
I'm Gersten Hayward
and I'd like to welcome you all

899
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:24,800
to the Hayward Supper Club.

900
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:29,305
I'm going to be playing
various selections

901
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:30,639
of music for you this evening.

902
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:33,100
My good news is that I was chosen

903
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,853
to be the fairy princess
in my school play.

904
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,355
This is my special dress.

905
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:41,817
Also, I got the highest scores
in mathematics and English

906
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:43,194
this midseason term,

907
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:45,821
just as my sisters, Harriet and Donna,
did before me.

908
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:49,325
So now I don't have to worry
about being ashamed anymore.

909
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,704
Before I play,
Harriet would like to read a poem

910
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:57,208
about your daughter
and our friend Laura.

911
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:19,522
Um...

912
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:21,774
It was Laura

913
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:25,611
And I saw her glowing

914
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:28,364
In the dark woods

915
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:31,700
I saw her smiling

916
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:36,497
We were crying and I saw her

917
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:39,500
Laughing

918
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:44,547
In our sadness
I saw her dancing

919
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:48,551
It was Laura living in my dreams

920
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:52,179
It was Laura

921
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:55,766
The glow was life

922
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:58,561
Her smile was to say

923
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:00,479
It was all right to cry

924
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:05,359
The woods was our sadness

925
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:09,989
The dance was her calling

926
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,866
It was Laura

927
01:21:13,868 --> 01:21:16,912
And she came to kiss me goodbye

928
01:21:30,093 --> 01:21:33,053
That was wonderful. Thank you.

929
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,940
Gersten.

930
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:50,154
Now I'm going to play Mendelssohn's
"Rondo Capriccioso, Opus 14."

931
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:39,036
I got the list and map
for Meals on Wheels.

932
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:40,996
I'm going to start tomorrow.

933
01:22:41,164 --> 01:22:42,998
Aces.

934
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:48,545
Long day, Will?

935
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:56,220
I feel like I've sat through
back-to-back operas.

936
01:22:56,846 --> 01:23:00,224
In med school, we learned to live
on three hours a night and catnaps.

937
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,476
It's terrible about the mill.

938
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,938
Yeah. They say more
than 150 jobs may be lost.

939
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:08,524
Awful. Just awful.

940
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:11,443
I suppose this will open the door

941
01:23:11,611 --> 01:23:16,573
for Ben Horne
and his big development plans.

942
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:19,243
Well, as his lawyer, and yours,

943
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:22,287
- of course I can't comment.
- Hmm.

944
01:23:22,455 --> 01:23:25,749
Well, as your doctor, Leland,

945
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:27,668
what the hell happened to your hair?

946
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,631
It is strange, isn't it?

947
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:33,924
Well, I just, uh...

948
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:37,052
I woke up this morning,
looked in the mirror, and there it was.

949
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,513
It had literally changed overnight.

950
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:42,141
Well, considering
all you've been through...

951
01:23:42,308 --> 01:23:44,309
You know,
the funny thing about it is,

952
01:23:44,477 --> 01:23:47,479
seeing it, I realized that I had

953
01:23:47,647 --> 01:23:50,107
turned a corner somehow.

954
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:53,360
I feel a great deal
of sadness still, yes,

955
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:56,488
but it wasn't as overwhelming to me.

956
01:23:56,656 --> 01:24:00,993
I physically felt as if a great weight
had been lifted from my heart.

957
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:03,996
- Perhaps it has.
- Perhaps it has.

958
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:05,914
Perhaps it has.

959
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:07,458
God, I feel like singing.

960
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:10,753
That would be very nice.

961
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,797
No, I really feel like singing a song.

962
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:20,721
- Leland?
- Come on, everybody. Get happy.

963
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,014
- "Get Happy."
- "Get Happy"?

964
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:23,432
Mm-hm.

965
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:30,314
Forget your troubles
And just get happy

966
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:32,649
You gotta pack all your cares away

967
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:35,068
Sing hallelujah
Come on, get happy

968
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,696
Get ready for the judgment day

969
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:40,157
The sun is shinin'
Come on, get happy

970
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:42,451
The Lord is waitin' to take your hand

971
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:45,245
Sing hallelujah
Come on, get happy

972
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:47,247
We're going to that promised land

973
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:52,127
We're headin' 'cross the river
Wash your sins away in the tide

974
01:24:52,295 --> 01:24:56,882
It's, oh, so peaceful on the other side

975
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,134
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy

976
01:24:59,302 --> 01:25:01,637
You better chase all your cares away

977
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,722
Sing hallelujah
Come on, get happy

978
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,474
Get ready for the judgment day

979
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:08,977
Sing hallelujah
Come on, get happy

980
01:25:09,145 --> 01:25:10,687
Get ready for the judgment day

981
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:12,481
Sing hallelujah
Come on, get happy

982
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:15,025
Get ready for the judgment d...

983
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:22,241
Donna, get my bag.

984
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,745
Leland?

985
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:32,334
- Dad, is he okay?
- I'm sure it's nothing serious.

986
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:39,174
Oh. Oh, God.

987
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:43,178
I feel happy.

988
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:45,389
"Begin the Beguine."

989
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:55,190
Diane, it's 11:55 p.m.,

990
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:57,901
approximately 19 hours
since the shooting incident

991
01:25:58,069 --> 01:26:00,362
which nearly caused me
to make a premature purchase

992
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:01,989
of the proverbial farm.

993
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:04,950
I'm dog-tired.

994
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:09,454
A man can only go so long
without submitting to a period of rest.

995
01:26:09,622 --> 01:26:11,206
For as we know from experiments

996
01:26:11,374 --> 01:26:14,418
conducted on American Gis
during the Korean War,

997
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:19,089
sleep deprivation is a one-way ticket
to temporary psychosis.

998
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:22,134
And I'm working on a three-day jag.

999
01:26:23,094 --> 01:26:24,803
I got so goofy last night, Diane,

1000
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:28,098
lying here wondering
whether I was going to live or die,

1001
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:32,311
that I thought I saw a giant
in my room.

1002
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:35,898
Or perhaps that's a story
I'll save for another time.

1003
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:38,775
This is me, Dale,

1004
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:43,113
Room 315 at The Great Northern Hotel,
signing off.

1005
01:27:07,263 --> 01:27:09,598
Special agent.

1006
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:14,311
Special agent. Special agent.

1007
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:20,609
Special agent, are you there?

1008
01:27:24,864 --> 01:27:27,157
I left you a note.
Didn't you get my note?

1009
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:31,912
I slipped it under your door.
You must have seen it.

1010
01:27:41,255 --> 01:27:43,340
Well, I'm up here
at One-Eyed Jack's.

1011
01:27:44,467 --> 01:27:48,303
To be perfectly honest,
I think I'm in a little over my head.

1012
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:54,518
Not that I can't handle it.

1013
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:58,271
I mean, if I'm gonna help you out
with your investigations,

1014
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:01,358
I'm sure I'll be put into situations
a lot more dangerous than this

1015
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:03,944
on a fairly regular basis.

1016
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:07,781
But it's just,

1017
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:12,411
you know, my first time out.

1018
01:28:12,578 --> 01:28:15,664
I could use a little expert guidance.

1019
01:28:20,044 --> 01:28:21,670
So you know,
there is a connection

1020
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:24,339
between Horne's Department Store
and One-Eyed Jack's.

1021
01:28:24,507 --> 01:28:27,551
It's my father. He owns the place.

1022
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:30,679
Little ball of sleaze named Battis
helps to recruit some of the girls

1023
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:33,640
from the perfume counter.

1024
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:37,728
Tomorrow I'm gonna try to find out
if Laura and Ronette came up here.

1025
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:48,280
I hope you won't think any less of me
for trying to help you.

1026
01:28:49,365 --> 01:28:53,577
You know, I promise I only did it
with the best of intentions.

1027
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:57,080
And if there's any way...

1028
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:02,544
If there's any way in the world
that you can hear me right now,

1029
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:05,505
please help me.

1030
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:09,176
Help me. Help me.

1031
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:56,306
Sorry to wake you.

1032
01:29:59,477 --> 01:30:01,520
I am not dreaming.

1033
01:30:02,105 --> 01:30:04,439
I forgot to tell you something.

1034
01:30:06,275 --> 01:30:08,819
You were right
about the smiling bag.

1035
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:13,698
The things I tell you
will not be wrong.

1036
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:19,621
Better to listen than to talk.

1037
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,666
I believe you.

1038
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:26,128
Don't search
for all the answers at once.

1039
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:32,342
A path is formed
by laying one stone at a time.

1040
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:40,767
One person saw the third man.

1041
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:45,063
Three have seen him, yes,

1042
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:47,149
but not his body.

1043
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:51,486
One only known to you.

1044
01:30:51,654 --> 01:30:53,738
Ready now to talk.

1045
01:30:56,909 --> 01:30:59,536
One more thing.

1046
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:02,372
You forgot something.

1047
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:05,959
What?

1048
01:32:11,442 --> 01:32:13,526
Laura! Laura!

1049
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,503
Laura!
