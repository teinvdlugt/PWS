1
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,869
Diane, it is 4:28 a.m.

2
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,247
I have just been woken up
by the most God-awful racket,

3
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,834
which you can probably hear
over the sound of my voice.

4
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,920
Can you hear that?

5
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,006
Up until this moment, I've experienced
nothing at the Great Northern Hotel

6
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,676
but the most pleasant,
courteous service imaginable.

7
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,887
However, it just goes to prove the point
that once a traveler leaves his home,

8
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:23,851
he loses almost 100 percent
of his ability to control his environment.

9
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,353
Diane, I was wondering if you could
overnight express to me

10
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,355
two pair of those
Ear-Pillow silicone earplugs

11
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,399
which I used on my last trip
to New York.

12
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,568
Naturally, I didn't bring them with me
on this trip,

13
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,444
because I didn't feel
it would be necessary.

14
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,155
However...

15
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,880
Coffee?

16
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,257
Please.

17
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,718
- What's with the choir practice?
- Heh.

18
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,429
Business junket. From Iceland.

19
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,598
Got in about 3 this morning.

20
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,016
Ohh.

21
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,810
- They're on my floor.
- Lucky you.

22
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,396
It'll take them a day or two
to reset their biological clocks.

23
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,733
- Heh. Hope the herring holds out.
- Mm.

24
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,114
How are you?

25
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,202
Well, Audrey, to be perfectly honest,
I'm tired and a little on edge.

26
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,578
Oh.

27
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,209
I got a job.

28
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,793
Good for you.

29
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,546
And I thought maybe now
I could help you with your case.

30
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,964
Guess where I'm going...

31
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,050
Audrey, you'll have to excuse me
this morning.

32
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,302
I'm running late.
I only have time for coffee.

33
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,304
Well, maybe I could go with you.

34
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,140
Wednesdays were traditionally
a school day when I was your age.

35
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,313
I can't believe
you were ever my age.

36
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,857
I've got the pictures to prove it.

37
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,653
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

38
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,781
We'll see you later, Audrey.

39
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,866
See you later.

40
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,537
Bye.

41
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,415
Ha, ha.
I'll see you later, Sons of Olden!

42
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,625
How do you say that?

43
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,174
My brother will love you guys.

44
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,227
Brother Ben, I bring you greetings

45
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,939
from the fertile treeless tundra
of Iceland.

46
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,694
We have had complaints
from nearly every guest in the hotel.

47
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,404
What are they on, nitrous oxide?

48
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,865
They are insane
for the Ghostwood Estates project.

49
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,869
I have had more serious fun
in two days with these Nordic animals.

50
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,205
And, Ben, I'm in love.

51
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,041
Her name is Heba.
She's a giant snow queen

52
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,877
with a smile
like a sunrise on an ice floe.

53
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,547
You could go blind looking at this girl.
Look at this.

54
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,384
You see what she gave me?
An entire leg of lamb.

55
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,177
- Jerry, come on.
- Is that beautiful?

56
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,722
Come on, look, you crush some garlic,
some fresh mint,

57
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,015
that's rotisserie heaven.

58
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,391
Come on, you gotta meet her.

59
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,435
Jerry, just grab some downtime,
will you?

60
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:17,983
We've laid in a gala reception
for your fair-haired boys tonight.

61
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,277
All of Twin Peaks'
best and brightest.

62
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,778
We're holding it in a phone booth?

63
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,323
And if we still need a kicker

64
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,577
to nail the sale, I'm thinking
that maybe they might enjoy

65
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:33,498
a little road trip up to, uh,
you-know-where. Ah?

66
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:38,086
Jack's. I am honored to know you.

67
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,091
Ben?

68
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,427
Leland, what are you doing here?

69
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,931
Well, I know there's a new
investment group arriving today.

70
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,892
If there's anything I can do...

71
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,605
Leland, the best thing that
you can do is follow doctor's orders.

72
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,607
Go home. You need your rest.

73
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,984
I just feel...

74
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,781
I just feel I need something
to occupy my mind.

75
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,828
Leland, will you take some time off,
for God's sakes?

76
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,289
Fly somewhere. Uh, take Sarah.

77
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,085
I'm afraid to go. I'm afraid.

78
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,340
Hawk, we're here

79
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,716
at Jacques Renault's apartment.

80
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,302
Get over here as soon as you can.

81
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,971
- Morning.
- Morning.

82
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,139
What do you got, Harry?

83
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,808
Jacques Renault's
a Canadian national.

84
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,435
He worked the lumber fields
this side of the border

85
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:39,314
until he put on a little excess tonnage
a couple of seasons ago.

86
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,608
That's when he started bartending
at the Roadhouse.

87
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,151
Harry,
are there any more doughnuts?

88
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,654
Sure. Andy.

89
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,822
Thank you.

90
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,490
Better wash that down
with a cup a joe.

91
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,659
I didn't get too much sleep last night.

92
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,369
Yeah, you do look a little peaked.

93
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:56,206
There's a large group of insane men
staying on my floor.

94
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,999
Jacques Renault turn up?

95
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,584
No one's seen him for two days.

96
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,586
We've canvassed the building
and the Roadhouse.

97
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,214
- I sent Hawk to roust his brother.
- I'll get back to you.

98
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,758
But it looks like Bernie's jumped bail.
There's no sign.

99
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,219
- Morning, Agent Cooper.
- Morning, doc.

100
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,849
The blood on the shirt you found here
is AB negative.

101
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,016
It's not Laura's blood.

102
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:19,521
So it was Jacques Renault's blood
on Leo Johnson's shirt. Hmm.

103
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,150
Hmm.

104
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,987
Oh. Thank you, Andy.

105
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,618
Mm.

106
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,537
What about Leo Johnson?
Could you hold this?

107
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,497
The APB went out last night.
Nothing yet.

108
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,625
- I need you to find out something.
- Could you give me a leg up here?

109
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,793
Sure.

110
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,379
What's Jacques Renault's blood type?

111
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,089
- Alley-oop.
- Unh.

112
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,303
Jacques Renault's blood
is AB negative.

113
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,721
Thanks, doc.

114
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,723
My pleasure.

115
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,561
Holy smoke. Flesh World again.

116
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,229
Yeah.

117
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,066
Harry, remember that ad
with the picture of Ronette Pulaski?

118
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,735
We traced that ad.

119
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,571
It came into the magazine
in a plain envelope, no name.

120
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,615
Well, the magazine's
a clearing-house.

121
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,783
Readers write letters
in response to the ads

122
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,911
and mail them in to the magazine.

123
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,080
The magazine forwards them on
to the advertisers.

124
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,583
No direct contact.

125
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,670
Ronette received her letters
at this post office box.

126
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,922
That's a local ZIP code.

127
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,715
Now, my guess is
that this post office box

128
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,968
will be registered
under the name of Jacques Renault.

129
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,180
Let's see
who was writing to Ronette.

130
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,307
Postmarked Georgia.

131
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,230
Good night.

132
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,814
I don't know.

133
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,108
The beard sort of ruins
the effect of the lingerie.

134
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,110
What do you think?

135
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,906
The guy's no Georgia peach.

136
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,699
Poor bastard.

137
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,201
By the way, Harry, did you notice

138
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,204
the picture of Leo Johnson's truck
on that page?

139
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,049
I love it when you cook for me.

140
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,218
Leo hates my cooking.

141
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,472
Leo missed the boat with you, baby.

142
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,890
The biggest mistake of your life

143
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,269
was dropping out of the 11th grade
and marrying that road hog.

144
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,649
What would you do
if he walked in right now?

145
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:35,240
Come here.

146
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,791
Hey, Leo. How's it going, man?

147
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
What a surprise.

148
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,590
Now, Leo, Shelly tells me
that you don't like her cooking.

149
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,719
Tell you what, she and I,
we're gonna sit here

150
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:59,222
while you cook breakfast for us,
you hump.

151
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,143
And if you so much as utter
one harsh syllable

152
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:08,148
to this beautiful girl,

153
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,693
I'm gonna shoot your ugly face off,
okay, man?

154
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,865
Sheriff's deputy.

155
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,034
Now, Shelly,
you do exactly what we said,

156
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,535
and everything's gonna be fine.

157
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,787
Okay? Come here. Mm.

158
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,384
Oh, hi, Andy. Come on in.

159
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,886
Hi, Shelly.

160
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,305
Do you know
when Leo might be back?

161
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,723
Is he in some kind of trouble?

162
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,642
No, we just wanna talk to him.

163
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,644
This wouldn't be about Laura, would it?

164
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,853
Why do you say that?

165
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,565
Well, I heard him talking
to this guy, Jacques, the night he left.

166
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,233
Jacques Renault?

167
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,235
Yeah. They were outside arguing.

168
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,572
I couldn't hear exactly, but they did
seem to be arguing about her,

169
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,074
and then they drove off together.

170
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,868
Shelly, you call us
the minute he gets in touch with you.

171
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,121
Okay, I will. Thanks for stopping by.

172
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,090
- How'd I do?
- You did great. Oh.

173
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,429
You drive me crazy.

174
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,273
- Hello?
- Hi.

175
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,275
Hi, Leo. Where you calling from?

176
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,361
Has anybody come by?

177
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,322
What's that?
Is anybody looking for you?

178
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,282
Why would anybody
be looking for you?

179
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,034
Are you sure?

180
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,369
You know how paranoid you get

181
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,955
when you've been popping bennies
on the road a couple of days.

182
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,248
So when are you coming home?

183
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,958
Soon. Everything okay?

184
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,627
Yeah, everything's fine, Leo.

185
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,214
Come on home.

186
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,466
I miss you, Shelly.

187
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,970
I miss you too.

188
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,364
Hey, good-looking.

189
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,907
Hope you don't mind my coming.

190
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,659
Oh, no.

191
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,661
Nadine won't be back
from that patent attorney

192
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,913
over there in Fairvale
for a couple of hours.

193
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,833
Ah. The famous
silent drape runners.

194
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,335
She's already spending the millions.

195
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,921
Well, I have to put gas in my car
like everyone else, right?

196
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,798
You bet.

197
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:45,013
I didn't wanna tell you on the phone,
but Hank got his parole.

198
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,600
Okay.

199
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,520
He'll be coming home. I mean, back.

200
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,607
I only saw him
a minute before the hearing.

201
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,984
He seemed so hopeful.

202
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,528
I didn't wanna say anything.

203
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,863
You don't have to explain.

204
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,865
Have you said anything
to Nadine yet?

205
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,326
Haven't yet.

206
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,329
Waiting for me to go first?

207
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,872
No.

208
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,376
It's just that, uh, Nadine's not well.

209
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,172
What are you saying?

210
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,216
I don't know.

211
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,512
I think I do.

212
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,306
I don't ever wanna hurt you, babe.

213
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,142
Maybe that's our trouble, Ed.

214
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,645
We never wanna hurt anyone.

215
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,231
We never just take what we want.

216
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,067
There's a part of me
that's beginning to think

217
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,403
that this is how it is
when you get to the end of your life

218
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,531
and that you don't have anything
to show for it.

219
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,991
Norma.

220
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,915
Don't call me.
I mean, not for a while, okay?

221
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,168
Okay.

222
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,713
I love you, Ed.

223
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,068
I can remember
when you were just a little girl.

224
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,903
So did my father speak to you?

225
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,572
Yes, yes, he did.

226
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:30,118
And I can't tell you how excited we are
to have you come on board

227
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,787
and put in a hitch with us
down here at our flagship.

228
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,914
So, what did you have in mind
for me?

229
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,667
Well, Audrey,
as per your father's suggestion,

230
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,128
starting low, aiming high, et cetera,

231
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,214
we thought perhaps
the Wrapping Department,

232
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,217
gifts, et cetera.
Part-time, after school.

233
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,470
No, no, no.

234
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:53,641
Emory, may I speak frankly?

235
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,144
Oh, please do.

236
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:02,066
Let's talk retail.

237
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,484
Sales?

238
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,320
Perfume.

239
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,323
One of our more, uh,
sensitive areas.

240
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,034
Expensive items,
delicate customer relations.

241
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,036
I'm afraid I've got my heart
set on it, Emory.

242
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,955
Heh. I'd have to talk to your father.

243
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,166
Emory, here's what we're gonna do.

244
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,959
You're gonna tell my father

245
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,754
that I'm busy as a bee
wrapping boxes with the drones.

246
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,839
Then you're gonna put me to work
this afternoon

247
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,466
behind the perfume counter,

248
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,552
because if you don't,
I'm gonna rip my dress in half

249
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,262
and scream at the top of my lungs

250
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,599
and tell my father
that you made a pass at me.

251
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,226
Does that help
to clear things up for you?

252
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,480
Yes.

253
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,191
Yes, what?

254
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,612
Yes, Miss Horne.

255
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,666
Shall we get started
on the paperwork?

256
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,468
James. I got your note.

257
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,596
Are you all right?

258
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,557
Donna,
there's some things I gotta say.

259
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,352
I told you
that my dad died when I was 10.

260
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,521
He didn't die.

261
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,401
He was a musician.
We were living on the West Coast.

262
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,361
He was a bum,
and he ran off on me and my mom.

263
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,405
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,739
My mom was a writer.

265
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,410
She was really good.
Poems and short stories.

266
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,038
She's an alcoholic.

267
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,333
If you have a problem with this,
I know you didn't ask to hear it.

268
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,919
I don't have a problem. You tell me.

269
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:52,135
It's true she was out of town this week,
but she wasn't traveling.

270
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,764
What she does
is she goes to another town,

271
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,517
shacks up in some cheap hotel
with a couple of bottles

272
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,771
and picks up guys and...

273
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,741
It's all right.

274
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,454
I'm telling you this because I don't
wanna have any secrets from you.

275
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,623
I don't want there to be any lies
between us.

276
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,083
It's the secrets people keep

277
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,085
that destroy any chance they have
of happiness,

278
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,670
and I don't want us to be like that.

279
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,298
We won't. We won't be.

280
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,972
We have to do what's right.

281
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,517
What you said yesterday was true.

282
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,645
If we don't do everything we can
to figure out what happened to Laura,

283
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,647
it'll never go away our whole lives.

284
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,192
We will, James.

285
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,238
She's out there,
wandering like a restless spirit.

286
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,491
I feel it too.

287
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,825
We owe it to her.

288
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,495
At least they're fresh.
Here you go, Gary.

289
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,455
Oh, thanks.

290
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,000
- Here you go, Scott.
- Thank you.

291
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,047
There you are.

292
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,965
What do you wanna mark this?

293
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,551
Mark it duplicate.
Do we have one like it?

294
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,304
Yeah, the same stain.
We had it before.

295
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,181
Mark it duplicate.

296
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,811
Hmm. Red drapes.

297
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,940
That PO Box was registered
to Jacques Renault.

298
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,568
Those are the letters responding
to Ronette's ad in the magazine.

299
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,571
Let's see if there's something
from someone we know.

300
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,241
Hawk, hand me that magazine,
would you?

301
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,450
What is it?

302
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,954
Two different ad numbers mailed
to the same post office address.

303
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,499
Ronette's and one other.

304
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,545
Yeah, here it is.

305
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,131
"Young student requires education
in the ways of love.

306
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,300
Only generous mature men
need apply."

307
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,886
It's Laura.

308
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,974
You see some identifying mark?

309
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,561
- The drapes.
- Drapes?

310
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,233
Red drapes, Harry, from my dream.

311
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,949
Now, why would an apartment dweller
like Jacques

312
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,076
buy 50 gallons of heating oil?

313
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,619
Yeah, yeah, I already got it.

314
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,996
To heat a log cabin.

315
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,414
Harry, you're all right.

316
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,750
Jacques' brother said something
about a place up near the state line.

317
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:33,546
Fellas, let's pack a lunch.
We're taking a walk in the woods.

318
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,890
Madeleine.

319
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

320
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,769
Hi. I'm Madeleine Ferguson.

321
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,355
My friends call me Maddy.

322
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,733
This is really nice of you guys.

323
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,529
I don't really know anybody in town
except Aunt Sarah and Uncle Leland.

324
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,282
And the mood at the house,
you can probably guess,

325
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,284
isn't that great right now.

326
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,952
Would you like something to drink?

327
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,746
A cherry Coke would be great.

328
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,581
You got it.

329
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,752
Madeleine.

330
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,173
If I said that you can't really say
a word of this to anyone, not a soul,

331
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,759
not even your aunt or uncle,
would that be okay with you?

332
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,761
It sounds like some big secret.

333
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,929
It is.

334
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,015
James and I knew Laura
better than anyone did.

335
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,559
She was in some kind
of terrible trouble before she died,

336
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,311
worse than any of us could imagine.

337
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,188
What?

338
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,566
Well, I'd rather not say too much
about things we can't prove yet.

339
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,321
You said you can't prove it yet.

340
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,156
We loved Laura.

341
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,325
We're afraid that the truth
might never come out

342
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,578
or that the person who killed her
might never be caught.

343
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,914
We've sworn on her memory
not to let that happen.

344
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,166
My God. You know who did it?

345
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,459
We have some ideas.

346
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,087
We wanted to talk to you about this
because we need your help.

347
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,838
What do you want me to do?

348
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,550
Laura used to talk about
a secret hiding place she had

349
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,594
somewhere in her house,
maybe in her room.

350
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,847
I'm not really sure.
But nobody else knew about it.

351
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,724
We think she might have
left something there

352
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,268
that could lead us to the killer.

353
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,146
I'll help you.

354
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,107
You will?

355
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,025
The day before she died,

356
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:22,196
I had a feeling
that Laura was in trouble.

357
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,117
I've always felt close to her.
That's why I came here.

358
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:32,123
You know,
I didn't really know Laura that well,

359
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,041
but I feel like I do.

360
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,712
Our folks were always telling us
how much alike we were.

361
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,840
Will you call me
if there's anything I can do?

362
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,301
I don't think there'll be any problem.

363
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,512
This is really great.

364
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,639
Call me Maddy.

365
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,605
- Hi.
- Hi, Norma.

366
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,400
We look like a couple
of refugee beauty queens.

367
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,402
You don't know how really
good-looking you are.

368
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,611
I never felt so glamorous.

369
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,905
Hope I don't chip a nail
slinging plates around.

370
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,073
Hi, Norma.

371
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,325
Hello, Hank.

372
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,743
Surprised to see me, huh?

373
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,078
Yes.

374
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,751
Is that Leo's girlfriend?

375
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,086
Wife.

376
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,672
That Leo. So impulsive.

377
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,258
Not much meat on her, though.

378
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,928
Hey, I don't expect a kiss
or anything.

379
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,432
I figure I gotta earn my way
back into your heart.

380
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:36,771
But, Norma, I intend to try.

381
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,191
So where do I start?

382
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,027
Washing dishes will be fine.

383
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:49,116
Can I finish my coffee first, boss?

384
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,625
Oh, no. Oh, no. No.

385
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,044
You little Froot Loop.

386
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,797
You're done! Done!

387
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,132
Don't ever cross me.

388
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,557
Tune in tomorrow for Invitation to Love.

389
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,150
He's been spending more and more
of his time alone in his room.

390
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,320
It's become much more difficult
to engage him in conversation.

391
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,947
Terrible mood swings.

392
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,367
We've been told by the school that his
attendance has become erratic at best.

393
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,369
And then there's the matter
of public fighting,

394
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,663
both at the Roadhouse
and at the funeral.

395
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,415
Are you using drugs, Bobby?

396
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,582
Nope.

397
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,042
- Alcohol.
- Alcohol's a drug.

398
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,586
- Well, that's not what he meant.
- Alcohol doesn't count?

399
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,463
Everybody drinks.

400
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,840
Are you unhappy, Bobby?

401
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,174
Shouldn't I be?

402
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,094
Well, that's not for me to say.

403
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,513
Have you ever killed anybody?

404
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,598
- Have you?
- My father has.

405
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,600
- During wartime.
- That's different.

406
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,352
Different from what?

407
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,522
Perhaps I should spend
a few minutes with Bobby alone.

408
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,524
This is supposed to be
family counseling.

409
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,736
Well, and I'll need to spend some time
with each member of the family alone,

410
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,364
but Bobby first.

411
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,366
- Fair enough.
- Whatever you say.

412
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,927
Bobby, let's just cut the crap, huh?

413
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,554
Okay, so your parents
don't understand

414
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,222
what you're going through right now.

415
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,517
Heh. That's a good one.

416
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,728
Let's talk about Laura.

417
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,771
Okay. Let's talk about Laura.

418
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,483
Bobby, what happened the first time

419
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,402
that you and Laura made love?

420
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,032
What the hell kind of question
is that?

421
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,453
Bobby, did you cry?

422
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,748
Did I what?

423
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,836
And then what did Laura do?
Did she laugh at you?

424
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,603
Were you very sad
when Laura died?

425
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,858
- Laura wanted to die.
- How do you know that?

426
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,284
Because she told me.

427
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,955
What else did she tell you?

428
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,835
Did she tell you
there was no goodness in the world?

429
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:54,134
She said people tried to be good,

430
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:59,306
but they were really sick and rotten,
her most of all.

431
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:04,395
And every time she tried to make
the world a better place,

432
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,147
something terrible came up
inside her

433
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:11,277
and pulled her back down into hell.

434
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:16,699
It took her deeper and deeper
into the blackest nightmare.

435
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,160
And every time, it got harder
to go back up to the light.

436
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,121
Did you sometimes have the feeling

437
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:26,667
that Laura was harboring
some awful secret?

438
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,335
Yeah.

439
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,589
Bad enough that she wanted to die
because of it?

440
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,756
Yes.

441
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,092
Bad enough that it drove her
to consciously try to find

442
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,844
people's weaknesses
and prey on them,

443
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,847
tempt them, break them down,

444
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,017
make them do terrible,
degrading things?

445
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,603
- Yes.
- Laura wanted to corrupt people.

446
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,188
Because that's how she felt
about herself.

447
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,773
Yes.

448
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,276
Is that what happened to you,
Bobby?

449
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,779
Is that what Laura did to you?

450
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,618
She wanted so much.

451
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,872
She made me sell drugs
so she could have them.

452
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,156
This way. Through here.

453
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,908
Watch your step there, city boy.

454
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,951
Thanks, Harry.

455
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,590
What is it, Hawk?

456
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,231
Is that the cabin we're looking for?

457
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,401
Maybe, maybe not.

458
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,821
You might wanna
hang back a step, doc.

459
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,740
Huh. Might want to, anyway.

460
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,638
About time you got here.

461
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,560
They move so slowly
when they're not afraid.

462
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:54,815
Come on, then.
My log does not judge.

463
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,496
I've got tea.

464
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,249
I've got cookies. No cake.

465
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,878
Well, that's very kind of you, ma'am,
but I don't believe that...

466
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,504
What kind of cookies?

467
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,507
Sugar.

468
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,552
The owls won't see us in here.

469
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,432
A cup of tea would be very nice.

470
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:33,479
Shut your eyes
and you'll burst into flames.

471
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,564
Thanks, Margaret.

472
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,650
We'll let it steep.

473
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,494
Wait for the tea.
The fish aren't running.

474
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,747
You've been expecting us,
Margaret?

475
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,373
You're two days late.

476
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,375
But that's your concern.

477
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,297
My log saw something.

478
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,882
Something significant.

479
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,842
What did your log see?

480
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,889
Tea first. Then be ready.

481
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,895
Thank you.

482
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,483
- My husband was a logging man.
- Oh?

483
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,818
He met the devil.

484
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:25,572
Fire is the devil
hiding like a coward in the smoke.

485
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,534
It was the day after the wedding,
wasn't it, Margaret?

486
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,080
The wood holds many spirits,
doesn't it, Margaret?

487
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,671
You can ask it now.

488
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,806
What did you see that night?

489
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,891
The night Laura Palmer was killed?

490
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,477
Shh.

491
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,813
I'll do the talking.

492
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,900
Dark.

493
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,278
Laughing.

494
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,780
The owls were flying.

495
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,032
Many things were blocked.

496
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,577
Laughing. Two men.

497
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,121
Two girls.

498
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:19,459
Flashlights pass by in the woods
over the ridge.

499
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,795
The owls were near.

500
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,299
The dark was pressing in on her.

501
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,218
Quiet then.

502
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,470
Later, footsteps.

503
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,556
One man passed by.

504
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,560
Screams far away.

505
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:41,356
Terrible. Terrible.

506
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,983
One voice.

507
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,236
- Man or girl?
- Girl.

508
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,782
Further up. Over the ridge.

509
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,493
The owls were silent.

510
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,215
The two girls
were Laura and Ronette.

511
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:11,929
The two men, Jacques, maybe Leo.

512
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,639
Maybe.

513
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,224
Who's the third man?

514
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,896
Do you hear it?

515
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,441
This way.

516
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,265
And there's always music in the air.

517
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,602
Waldo.

518
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,355
There's film in here.

519
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,988
Blood.

520
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,970
One-Eyed Jack's.

521
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,243
Evening, Mr. and Mrs. Showel.

522
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,329
- Okay. Go right ahead.
- Thank you.

523
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,747
Good evening.

524
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,417
- Catherine Martell and spouse.
- Mm-hm.

525
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:54,591
Go easy on the sauce tonight,
okay, Cathy?

526
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,849
Couple of belts and even you
might start to look good to me.

527
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,158
Of course,
the modern age has changed forever

528
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,785
the way your people live,
Mr. Thorson.

529
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,870
But it would be my guess
that there still remains

530
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,622
a tremendous vestigial interest

531
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,041
in the legends and folklore
of ancient Iceland.

532
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,710
Vestigial. Absolutely.

533
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,505
Heba, did you know that was
an American figure of speech?

534
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,006
No, Jerry. Ha, ha.

535
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:38,385
Heba, Heba.
You never heard that before?

536
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,303
No, Jerry. Ha-ha-ha.

537
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,775
Do you realize the incredible potential
that could result

538
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:59,281
from our taking a mutual dip
in each other's respective gene pools?

539
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,744
Heba, I wanna cook for you.

540
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,832
Very, very good. That's funny.

541
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,880
So he says, "What do you get when
you cross a Norwegian with a Swede?

542
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,007
A socialist who wants to be king."

543
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,845
Well, I can remember it was,
I think, oh, somewhere in the '50s,

544
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,183
I came through your country.
Beautiful, beautiful.

545
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,269
Not many trees, though,
you know, but...

546
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,357
Hmm.

547
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,361
Would you excuse me?

548
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,697
Of course.

549
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,326
Meet me in my office.
Give me two minutes to break away.

550
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,621
- Hell hath no fury.
- What?

551
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,457
Two minutes.

552
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,336
Ah, Thor,
I've been meaning to ask you,

553
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,464
are you familiar
with the word luhamsta?

554
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:23,490
Catherine, we agreed,
no scenes in front of the guests.

555
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,243
Let's keep the melodrama
to a minimum.

556
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,247
The next thing I know, you're polishing
my shoes with Dom Pérignon.

557
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,500
Fill me in. What's eating you?

558
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,797
Why did you have this
thousand-dollar poker chip

559
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,716
from you-know-where
in your pants yesterday?

560
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,844
I thought you preferred women
with certain experience.

561
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,846
Hmm.

562
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,099
Jerry gave me that.

563
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,685
It's a good-luck charm.

564
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:55,855
I thought I'd lost it.
I'm so relieved that you found it.

565
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,485
Are you quite finished?

566
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,992
Yes.

567
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,160
In that case...

568
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,212
Oh. Let's burn the mill.

569
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,755
Let's do it tonight.

570
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,549
No, my love.

571
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,926
We'll give Josie
one last chance to sell.

572
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,094
Tomorrow.

573
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:31,474
Failing that,
I have retained the services

574
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,977
of a qualified professional.

575
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,730
Breath mint?

576
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,832
Now, let me get this straight.

577
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:03,048
Your entire country
is above the timberline?

578
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:06,009
Folks, ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

579
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,177
Can I have your attention?

580
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:12,265
Heh. First off, I wanna thank you all
for turning out

581
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,478
to welcome our neighbors
from the magical isle of Iceland.

582
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,526
We are all Icelanders.

583
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,990
The Ghostwood Estates project

584
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,284
is an important part of our future
here in Twin Peaks,

585
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,162
and there's no one we'd rather have
as partners in our future than...

586
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,249
What...?

587
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,267
Dance with him.

588
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,478
It is serious. Dance with him.

589
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,614
All right.

590
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,662
Jerry, what's going on?

591
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:20,834
Get Jacoby, get a net,
but get him out of my life.

592
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,720
What are they doing?

593
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,516
Jerry. Jerry.

594
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,148
Gather round.

595
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,075
Donna? It's Maddy.

596
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,036
I was looking in Laura's room
and I remembered

597
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,581
when we were younger, she used
to hide cigarettes in her bedpost.

598
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,001
The top of one of the posts
screws off.

599
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,754
I found a tape in her hiding place.

600
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,547
Leland? Where did you go?

601
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,300
I'll meet you and James tomorrow.

602
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,929
- Okay. And bring a tape recorder.
- Leland?

603
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,176
Did anyone see you come in here?

604
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,719
No.

605
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:42,767
You do realize the risk
if anyone sees us.

606
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:47,647
This was hidden in her desk
where you said it would be.

607
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,321
- Then we can proceed.
- When?

608
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,827
Tomorrow night.

609
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:54,172
Over here. Told you to mind the store,
Leo, not open your own franchise.

610
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,050
- Hank, I...
- Do as you're told, Leo.

611
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:01,220
Next time, you'll watch me take
your little chippy apart before I kill you.

612
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,811
Get me a beer, Shelly.

613
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,647
Honey, what happened?
Are you okay?

614
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,732
- Just get me a damn beer!
- Aah!

615
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,236
Get up and...

616
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,906
What the hell are you doing
with that?

617
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,033
You're not gonna hurt me again.

618
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,911
Don't touch me.
Don't come near me, Leo.

619
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,246
You stupid little slut.

620
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,249
You haven't got the guts.

621
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,796
Reach over and turn on the light.

622
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,804
Don't make me leave.

623
00:45:26,181 --> 00:46:26,949
Please, don't make me leave.
