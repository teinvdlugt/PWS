1
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,659
Buddhist tradition first came
to the land of snow

2
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,744
in the 5th century A.D.

3
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,288
The first Tibetan king to be touched
by the dharma

4
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,582
was King Hathatha Rignamputsan.

5
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,960
He and succeeding kings
were collectively known

6
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,045
as the Happy Generations.

7
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:14,633
Now, some historians place them
in a Water Snake year, 213 A.D.

8
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,804
Others in the year of a Water Ox,
173 A.D.

9
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,181
Amazing, isn't it?
The Happy Generations.

10
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,684
Agent Cooper, I am thrilled to pieces
that the dharma came

11
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,269
to King Ho-Ho-Ho, I really am,

12
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,688
but I'm trying to focus
on the more immediate problems

13
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,481
of our own century here
in Twin Peaks.

14
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,569
Albert, you'd be surprised
at the connection between the two.

15
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,529
Color me amazed.

16
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,824
Ronette Pulaski
has woken from her coma.

17
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,492
And?

18
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,704
I'm thinking she's gonna have
quite a story to tell,

19
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,498
- when she regains the ability to speak.
- So she's not talking?

20
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:50,836
Mm. Waking but silent,
probably shock.

21
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,756
I'm gonna show her the sketches
of Leo Johnson and Bob,

22
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,092
the man Sarah Palmer saw
in her vision.

23
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,136
The man who came to me
in my dream.

24
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,930
Has anyone seen Bob on Earth
in the last few weeks?

25
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,932
No, not yet.

26
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:08,228
Okay. I performed the autopsy
on Jacques Renault.

27
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,230
Stomach contents revealed...

28
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,774
Let's see.
- beer cans, a Maryland license plate,

29
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,820
half a bicycle tire, a goat
and a small wooden puppet,

30
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,614
goes by the name of Pinocchio.

31
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,407
You're making a joke.

32
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,076
I like to think of myself
as one of the Happy Generations.

33
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,371
And by the way,
the fat boy wasn't strangled.

34
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,041
Killer snuffed him with a pillow.
He was wearing gloves.

35
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,834
Tape used to bind his wrists
was stolen

36
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,878
from the hospital supply closet.
That is it.

37
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,256
If Jacques has any secrets,
he'll be taking them underground.

38
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,427
- What about the mill?
- Well, preliminary suggests arson.

39
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,721
I nominate Leo Johnson.

40
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,140
We'll have to get a statement
from Shelly Johnson.

41
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,059
Hospital says she's well enough.

42
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,687
How do you feel?

43
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,566
- Me?
- I believe it's customary to ask

44
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,236
after the health of one
recently plugged three times.

45
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,196
Thanks for asking.

46
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,823
- Don't get sentimental.
- Who shot me, Albert?

47
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,576
My men are interrogating
the hotel guests,

48
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,828
the usual bumper crop
of rural know-nothings

49
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,581
and drunken fly fishermen.
Nothing so far.

50
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,583
The world's most decrepit
room-service waiter

51
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,211
remembers nothing out of the ordinary
about the night.

52
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,963
No surprise there.

53
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,841
Señor Droolcup has, shall we say,
a mind that wanders.

54
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,639
Albert, my ring is gone.

55
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,353
One day here, the next day gone.

56
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,146
So?

57
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,234
I'm glad you're with us, Albert.
We need the very best.

58
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,612
Dedication to duty wasn't the only thing
that brought me back here, Cooper.

59
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,032
- What else?
- Windom Earle.

60
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,329
Agent Earle?

61
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,290
He's retired.

62
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,210
To a nice comfy chair
complete with wrist restraints

63
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,379
at the local laughing academy.

64
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,089
What happened?

65
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,174
Nobody knows.

66
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,637
Your former partner
flew the coop, Coop.

67
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,141
He escaped. Vanished into thin air.

68
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,601
That's not good.

69
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,241
Hello?

70
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,537
Mrs. Tremond?
It's Meals on Wheels.

71
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,041
Hello?

72
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,126
Enter.

73
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,303
Mrs. Tremond?

74
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,141
Can I put your meal here?

75
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,602
Yes, that's fine.

76
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,744
Miss?

77
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,162
Oh, hi.

78
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,375
Sometimes things
can happen just like this:

79
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,804
Creamed corn.

80
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,686
Do you see creamed corn
on that plate?

81
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,274
Yes.

82
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,486
I requested no creamed corn.

83
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,243
Do you see creamed corn
on that plate?

84
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,540
No.

85
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:51,261
My grandson is studying magic.

86
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,805
That's nice.

87
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,773
Who are you?

88
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,653
I'm taking over Laura Palmer's place
on the Meals on Wheels.

89
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,284
She's dead.

90
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,788
Did you know her well?

91
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,171
No.

92
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,348
Okay, Mrs. Tremond.

93
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,644
I'll be back tomorrow to pick this up
and to bring your lunch.

94
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,189
They used to bring me
hospital food.

95
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,275
Imagine that.

96
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,656
Young lady?

97
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,243
You might ask Mr. Smith next door.

98
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,372
He was Laura's friend.

99
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:11,341
Mr. Smith does not leave his house.

100
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,168
Hello?

101
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:59,723
She seemed like a very nice girl.

102
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,319
Thanks, Harry.

103
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,083
Ronette?

104
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,015
I can't get this thing to work.

105
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,397
Excuse us, Ronette.

106
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,651
"Stop.

107
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:42,951
Read operating instructions
beneath seat before using.

108
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,459
Stand next to chair or stool.

109
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,421
Do not remain seated.

110
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,340
Place foot on base

111
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,051
and pull seat all the way up

112
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,595
until you hear a click."

113
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,895
Sorry, Ronette.

114
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,492
Ronette,

115
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,703
can you hear me?

116
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,414
Okay.

117
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,041
I'm glad you're feeling better.

118
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,337
I don't want to upset you,
but we need your help.

119
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,425
I'm gonna show you some sketches.

120
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,928
We need to know
if you've seen these men before.

121
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,766
We need to know if these
are the men that hurt you, okay?

122
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,107
Do you recognize this man?

123
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,449
Is this the man that hurt you?

124
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,797
Mm.

125
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,140
Ronette.

126
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,496
Train. Train.

127
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,123
- Ronette?
- Tr... Train, train.

128
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,376
- Nurse. Right away.
- Train?

129
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,294
- Train?
- Tra...

130
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:02,382
Are you in the train car? Train car?

131
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,135
Train, train, train!

132
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,596
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Train!

133
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,390
Okay, okay. Stay calm.

134
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,725
Train, train.

135
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:18,022
Brother Ben,
we've got two ledgers

136
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,818
and one smoked cheese pig.

137
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,528
Which one do we burn?

138
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,447
And it ain't gonna be my pig.

139
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:36,749
The real ledger shows the mill
slowly sinking into bankruptcy,

140
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,586
masterminded by Catherine.

141
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,548
The one she faked,
for public consumption,

142
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,510
shows the mill
turning a healthy profit.

143
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,598
So which one do we burn?

144
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,225
Catherine's dead,

145
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,520
we put all of our money on Josie,

146
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,399
Catherine takes the fall for the fire,

147
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,193
Josie pockets the insurance money,

148
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:08,865
sells us the mill and the land and...
No, wait a minute.

149
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:13,828
First she has to get dear Pete
to sign on the dotted line.

150
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,874
Why does Pete have to sign?

151
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:23,671
Andrew's will calls for Catherine
or her heirs to approve of any sale.

152
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:27,050
So which one do we burn?

153
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,762
Once Josie sells us the mill,

154
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,557
we could get a better price
if it appears to be more profitable.

155
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,768
So we burn the real one.

156
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,645
On the other hand,

157
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:43,733
the real one would hold up
under any future scrutiny.

158
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:50,782
Depending upon how one looks
at the situation, it appears

159
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,575
they both have merit.

160
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,786
I know.

161
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,247
Maybe we should burn both of them.

162
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:03,962
It looks like we are 100 percent certain
that we're not sure.

163
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:09,968
Jer, obviously something
requires burning.

164
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:16,724
And since we don't wanna set fire
to your smoked cheese pig,

165
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,770
why don't we, uh,

166
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,982
try these?

167
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,068
Marshmallows!

168
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,155
Ben, where are those hickory sticks?

169
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,756
Margaret,
it's always very nice to see you.

170
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,719
But if you're gonna spit
your sticky pitch gum out in the diner,

171
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,054
please use an ashtray

172
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,223
and not the counter or the booth
like you did last time?

173
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,441
I'll have a bear claw.

174
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,828
You wear shiny objects
on your chest.

175
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,831
Yes, I do.

176
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,875
Are you proud?

177
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,837
No, achievement is its own reward.
Pride obscures it.

178
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,340
Cream?

179
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,599
My log has something to tell you.

180
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,101
Do you know it?

181
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,687
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

182
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,858
I do not introduce the log.

183
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,152
Can you hear it?

184
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,616
No, ma'am, I cannot.

185
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,077
I will translate.

186
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,379
Deliver the message.

187
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,551
Do you understand?

188
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,598
Yes, ma'am.
As a matter of fact, I do.

189
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,668
No messages, Deputy Brennan.

190
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,676
Listen to me, Lucy Moran.
You just listen.

191
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,054
When the Tacoma Sperm Bank
was looking for donors,

192
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,805
naturally, I applied.

193
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,642
It's my civic duty,
and I like whales.

194
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,980
A routine physical examination
revealed that I'm sterile.

195
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,400
Sure, I thought it meant
I didn't have to take a bath,

196
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,070
but the doctors told me the truth.

197
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,198
They told me I can't have babies.

198
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:49,288
So, what I wanna know now is
why are you having one and how?

199
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,336
Hello, Hank.

200
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,467
I bet Lucy asked you
to wait outside, huh?

201
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,594
Might've.

202
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,183
You know,
that's an awfully cute buck, Harry.

203
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,813
Let's not waste our time.

204
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,690
Okay.

205
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,526
Why don't you

206
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,947
just sign in like a good boy?

207
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,074
Keep your nose clean
for another week.

208
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,389
It's really nice to see you again.

209
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,281
Interesting piece of work.

210
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,701
How long were you
and Hank friends?

211
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,621
We grew up together.

212
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,499
Hank used to be
a Bookhouse Boy.

213
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,585
Back then,

214
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,546
Hank was one of the best of us.

215
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,298
Sheriff Truman,

216
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,217
I have Ben Horne
on the phone for you.

217
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,386
Would you like me
to transfer him to you?

218
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,347
Well, not him but his phone call?

219
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,309
Put him on, Lucy.

220
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,649
Mr. Horne, this is Lucy.

221
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,819
I'm gonna transfer you now
into Sheriff Truman's office.

222
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,780
He's in there with
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

223
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,282
Okay, so hold on.

224
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,668
Sheriff Truman,
I've transferred Ben Horne to you.

225
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,004
It's the line with the light
that's blinking.

226
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,342
- Yes, Ben.
- Harry,

227
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,719
Audrey's missing.

228
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,682
- What?
- For as much as, uh, maybe two days.

229
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,100
You hold on.

230
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,145
Audrey Horne is missing.

231
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:16,787
One insurance policy, unsigned.

232
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,581
"Un"?

233
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,501
The agent said that Catherine
was concerned

234
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,795
about certain irregularities,

235
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:29,592
such as Josie being named
the chief beneficiary.

236
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,844
Agent wasn't supposed
to show it to her.

237
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:36,182
Well, considering
Catherine's smoky fate,

238
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,226
for our side, it's all for the best.

239
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:45,357
Well. Win a few, lose a few.

240
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,070
Let's get those pickled icemen
on the blower.

241
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,161
Gentlemen,
I've been giving this a lot of thought.

242
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,206
This mill fire will put contract signing
on hold for the moment,

243
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,709
so we must ensure that the moment,
our moment, does not pass us by.

244
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,544
I therefore recommend
we make a quick

245
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,463
but cordial follow-up phone call
to Iceland,

246
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,714
a little gentle handling,

247
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,300
let Einar know
that we're right on top of this thing.

248
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,969
We can handle that.

249
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,597
Ben Horne for Einar Thorson.

250
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,226
Oh. Now, this is a coincidence.

251
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,271
Einar.

252
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,235
What's that?

253
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,988
Where did you hear about it?

254
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:38,661
Mr. Palmer called
to tell you about the fire?

255
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,667
No, no, I wouldn't call it
a disaster at all.

256
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:48,504
It's just one of those things,
an unfortunate development.

257
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,880
But I assure you, Einar,

258
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,467
that it in no way
will affect our development plans.

259
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,843
Jerry Horne here, Einar.

260
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,597
Full speed ahead.

261
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,560
Yes, yes, of course, Einar.

262
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,563
We will fax all pertinent details
to you.

263
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,855
Yes, yes, I promise.

264
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:11,443
Listen, I don't want you to worry
your attractive blond head about this.

265
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,821
Einar, I'm in a meeting. Gotta go.

266
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,741
Leland?

267
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,288
Leland, here's an idea.

268
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,748
Let's take you off
of damage control,

269
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,960
let you concentrate on something
that you can handle.

270
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,588
Like my tax return.

271
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,470
I know him.

272
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,431
Excuse me?

273
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:47,855
My grandfather's summer house
on Pearl Lakes.

274
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,609
He lived right next door.

275
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,195
I was just a little boy.

276
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,366
But I know him.

277
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,122
I've gotta tell the sheriff
about this right away.

278
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,501
Jerry,

279
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,713
please kill Leland.

280
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:18,093
Is this real, Ben,

281
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:23,015
or some strange and twisted dream?

282
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:29,396
The bullet lodged in Leo's spine...

283
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,899
It's all right, Shelly, come on.

284
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:36,779
The bullet lodged in his spine,
but we removed it successfully.

285
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,949
As for possible paralysis,
it's too early to tell.

286
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,576
Leo lost a lot of blood,

287
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,537
most of it before we had a chance
to operate.

288
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:49,625
I fear the resulting oxygen deprivation
starved his brain,

289
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,544
induced the coma you see here.

290
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,422
Is he a vegetable?

291
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,510
Is he in pain?

292
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,512
He's not in pain.

293
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,181
Beyond that, it's hard to say.

294
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,268
Can you make him better?

295
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,313
We can maintain his current state.

296
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,025
Offer nutrition, life-support.

297
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,946
Beyond that,
the only ally we have is time.

298
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,907
I'm sorry, Shelly.

299
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,201
Me too.

300
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,663
Are they gonna put him in prison?

301
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:32,334
I know he's a suspect
in several felonies.

302
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,132
I guess at the moment
he's kind of in prison anyway.

303
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,509
Yes, he is.

304
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,774
Come on, I'll take you back
to your room.

305
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,405
Norma's waiting downstairs
to drive you home.

306
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,795
Hello, Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station.

307
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,923
Who may I say is calling, please?

308
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,052
I'm sorry, I can't connect you
with Sheriff Truman

309
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,055
unless you tell me
what your name is.

310
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,808
You won't?

311
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,021
I'm sorry, but I can't connect you
with Sheriff Truman

312
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,982
unless you tell me who you are.

313
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,864
I'm terribly sorry,
but I'm going to have to hang up now.

314
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,470
Hey, I'll take it from here.

315
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,388
No. No, you won't.

316
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,474
No, it's okay.

317
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:14,186
Okay, but watch out for this one.

318
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,896
Okay.

319
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,320
Why is the vacuum cleaner off?

320
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,614
Look at those toes.

321
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,700
What toes?

322
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,160
I brought the ice.

323
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,998
Frosty? My little snowman.

324
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,709
I feel a cold front moving in.

325
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,294
Mm.

326
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:25,841
Hi, Emory.
You remember me? Huh?

327
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,386
It really looks like you got yourself
in a fix here, huh?

328
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,596
Well, guess what.

329
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,599
I'm gonna tell you a nice
little bedtime story. Are you ready?

330
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:38,020
Once upon a time there was
a sweet, innocent girl named Red...

331
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,229
That's me.

332
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,357
- And she met a bad old wolf...
That's you.

333
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:46,737
- And she kicked the crap out of that
wolf and she told her daddy all about it.

334
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,988
Then she told the police,

335
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,991
and the bad old wolf
went to jail for a million years.

336
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,994
- What do you want?
- I wanna know everything you know.

337
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,915
Perfume counter, Laura Palmer,
Ronette Pulaski and One-Eyed Jack's.

338
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,167
You're insane.

339
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,169
Heh. I'm insane?

340
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,172
Well, I'm Audrey Horne
and I get what I want.

341
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,299
- Understand?
- Yes, all right.

342
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,594
I work for the owner
of One-Eyed Jack's.

343
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,804
- Who is?
- I work for the owner

344
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,349
- of One-Eyed Jack's.
- Who is?

345
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,600
Your father.

346
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,645
He owns it all.
Hell, he owns everything.

347
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,772
I run girls
through the perfume counter.

348
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,899
I recruited Ronette and Laura.

349
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,944
- Did Laura come here?
- One weekend.

350
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,363
She was using drugs.

351
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,782
We threw her out.
I never saw her again, I swear.

352
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,784
Did my father know
that Laura was here?

353
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,494
Yes, yes, he did.

354
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:40,123
Mr. Horne makes it his business
to entertain all the girls.

355
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,293
Did she know he owned this place?

356
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,544
Owned what?

357
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:48,548
- One-Eyed Jack's!
- Yes! Yes. Probably she did.

358
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,592
Laura always got her way.

359
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,971
Understand?

360
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,181
Just like you.

361
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,323
Why don't you change the station?

362
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,494
That's good.

363
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,039
Yeah.

364
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,711
I made the call.

365
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,838
Told them I was Leo's cousin.

366
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,715
Leo gets his disability

367
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:33,343
as long as he stays out of prison.
It's a lot of money, Shelly.

368
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,387
Over 5,000 a month.

369
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,099
But you only get it
if he stays at home.

370
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,729
I don't care about the money.
I don't want Leo home.

371
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,773
Leo is in dreamland.

372
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,902
You can stick him in the corner
and hang doughnuts from his ears.

373
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,363
Sheriff Truman wants me
to make a statement.

374
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,367
No way. Look, they can't force you
to testify against your husband.

375
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,911
All you gotta do is get Leo home,

376
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,789
sit and collect the checks.

377
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,336
Leo owes you, baby.

378
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,589
Now we can really make him pay.

379
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,340
You want something nice?
We can buy it.

380
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:16,178
You want to go someplace special,
sit in the sun?

381
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,305
It's on Leo. Understand?

382
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,731
I guess it would be nice
not to have to worry about money.

383
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,233
I have a lot of bills I have to pay.

384
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:35,697
Bills? Forget about bills.
I'm talking about a new way of life.

385
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,369
Together?

386
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,754
What do you think?

387
00:34:55,927 --> 00:35:00,680
I think I wanna get comfortable.

388
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:04,184
That's why I got
my dad's Continental.

389
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,189
Mm.

390
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:14,361
Bobby Briggs,
I'm gonna eat you up.

391
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,863
Promise?

392
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,575
Just watch me.

393
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,794
Diane, I received
some very bad news today.

394
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,464
Windom Earle has vanished.

395
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,342
The disappearance
of my former partner

396
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,220
is extremely troubling.

397
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,766
I also learned that Audrey Horne
is missing.

398
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:50,438
Audrey's absence touches me
in ways I could not predict.

399
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:54,025
I find myself thinking not of clues
or of evidence

400
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,903
but of the content of her smile.

401
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,701
Who is it?

402
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,829
It's Major Briggs, Agent Cooper.

403
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,256
Just a moment.

404
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,847
- Major.
- May I come in?

405
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,473
Please.

406
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,734
I have a message for you.

407
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,611
From whom?

408
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:42,324
I'm not at liberty
to reveal the nature of my work.

409
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,452
This secrecy pains me
from time to time.

410
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,496
Any bureaucracy
that functions in secret

411
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:52,042
inevitably lends itself to corruption.

412
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,503
But these rules I have pledged
to uphold.

413
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,172
I believe a pledge is sacred.

414
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,132
Speaking as a man

415
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,010
and a fellow employee
of the federal government, so do I.

416
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,930
Well, I may reveal this much:

417
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,973
Among my many tasks

418
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,268
is the maintenance
of deep-space monitors

419
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:13,104
aimed at galaxies beyond our own.

420
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,693
We routinely receive
various communications,

421
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:22,239
space garbage,
to decode and examine.

422
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,741
They look something like this.

423
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,623
It's radio waves and gibberish,
Agent Cooper.

424
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,293
Till Thursday night.

425
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,504
Friday morning, to be exact.

426
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,715
Around the time that I was shot.

427
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:46,221
The readout took us by surprise.

428
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,890
Row after row of gibberish.

429
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,142
And all of a sudden...

430
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,647
"The owls are not what they seem."

431
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,615
Why did you bring this to me?

432
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,786
Because later in the morning...

433
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,580
"Cooper,

434
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,837
Cooper. Cooper."

435
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,757
My God.

436
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,890
That was really good.
Let's try it again.

437
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:55,832
Just you and I

438
00:38:56,083 --> 00:39:03,923
Just you and I

439
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,303
Together

440
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:13,058
Forever

441
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:16,519
In love

442
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,109
Just you

443
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,153
Just you

444
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:29,074
And I
BOTH: And I

445
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:33,328
- Just you
MADDY & DONNA: Just you

446
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,663
And I

447
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,249
And I

448
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:42,379
Together

449
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:46,424
Forever

450
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:55,934
In love

451
00:39:56,143 --> 00:40:00,522
In love

452
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,693
We go strolling together

453
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,702
In love

454
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:23,670
We go strolling forever

455
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,423
Oh

456
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:32,011
- Just you
BOTH: Just you

457
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:36,307
And I
BOTH: And I

458
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:42,897
Just you and I

459
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,691
And I

460
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,028
Together

461
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,656
Forever

462
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:57,745
In love

463
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,921
Just you

464
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,049
And I

465
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,179
Just you

466
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,267
And I

467
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,771
Just you

468
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,941
And I

469
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,820
Just you

470
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,200
And I

471
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,620
Just you

472
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,791
Donna.

473
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,503
Donna, what's wrong?

474
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,379
Nothing.

475
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,051
Donna?

476
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,385
Donna, what's going on?

477
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,721
I'm trembling, James.

478
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,806
You made me.

479
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,809
Donna.

480
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,898
Donna?

481
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,442
Yes?

482
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,988
There's a telephone call for you
from a Harold Smith.

483
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,326
Oh, okay. I'll get it in the hallway.

484
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,381
Okay, Dad. I got it.

485
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,800
Okay, sweetheart.

486
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,387
Hello?

487
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,765
Mr. Smith?

488
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,937
I received yours.

489
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,692
I wanted to talk to you.

490
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,153
We can meet?

491
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,781
Okay.

492
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,371
The owls are not what they seem.

493
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:36,547
The owls are not what they seem.

494
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,977
Laura!

495
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,190
Laura!

496
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,461
Agent Cooper.

497
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,839
- It's me, Audrey.
- Audrey?

498
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,841
Where are you?

499
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,467
Why aren't you here?

500
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,429
Audrey, this is no time
for schoolgirl games.

501
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,097
I want you home now.

502
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,892
I saw you in your tuxedo.

503
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,395
You look like a movie star.

504
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,314
Audrey,
if you're in any kind of trouble...

505
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:39,152
I am in trouble,
but I'm gonna come home now.

506
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,448
Audrey? Audrey?

507
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,534
Trouble, Miss Horne?

508
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,120
You don't know what trouble is.

509
00:45:50,164 --> 00:46:54,852
Not by a long shot.
