1
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,248
You guys didn't tell me
this stuff smells like cat piss.

2
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,288
Man, shit happens, huh?

3
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,840
I mean, I'm sorry,
but I had to do it.

4
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,402
Obviously, I guess you
see it different.

5
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,762
Some of you.
But I didn't see any other choice.

6
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,969
I've been thinking about this all
day, going over it in my head...

7
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,407
...and it was the only way.

8
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,767
Well, it's not like I wanted to.

9
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,127
The kid was on a dirt bike.
He could've just...

10
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,682
He could've gunned it and been gone
before we even had a chance to blink.

11
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,049
We never would've caught him.
I thought on my feet. I saw a threat...

12
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,647
- ...and I took care of it.
- A threat?

13
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,161
The kid was waving at us.

14
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,641
He wasn't going anywhere.
He was saying hi.

15
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,121
- Yeah, but you don't know that.
- Yeah, I do.

16
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,966
- He didn't know what he'd seen.
- I didn't want to take that chance.

17
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,567
The whole point of this was no one
was supposed to know we were there.

18
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,446
People weren't supposed to
know anything got robbed.

19
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,648
How could we let the kid go?

20
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,804
He made us. If I hadn't done what I
did, the mission would've failed.

21
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,849
I'm real sorry.

22
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,847
I really am, but I...

23
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,642
But did I make a mistake, Mr. White?
Because to me, you know, respectfully...

24
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,644
...I was looking out for the team.
I didn't want to kill him.

25
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,007
You gotta believe that.

26
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,131
At the end of the day, it was
him or us, and I chose us.

27
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,089
And I would do it again.

28
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,727
Okay, look.

29
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,606
Todd, why don't you step outside for a
few minutes so we can talk this through?

30
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,250
Of course. Yeah, you guys talk.

31
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,161
But I just want to make sure that you
know that my priority is this business.

32
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,362
Okay. That's fine, Todd. Thank you.

33
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,205
I want to be a real part of this.

34
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,967
All right? If you could just see that.
I'm motivated and I've got connections.

35
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,083
My uncle's got his
hookups in prison...

36
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,164
...who I think could be a real help
to us if...

37
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,326
Okay. That dude? Wack job.

38
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,041
- Let's just stick to the facts here.
- Facts? Oh, okay.

39
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,521
How about the fact
that he shot a kid?

40
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,489
A kid that he didn't need to shoot.

41
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,722
Well, the boy had seen us.

42
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,044
And, no, it didn't look like he knew
what he was seeing.

43
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,684
But what if he told somebody?

44
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,605
What if he just mentioned it
in passing?

45
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,444
We can't know what someone--

46
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,446
Exactly. We can't know,
because Ricky Hitler there shot him.

47
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,207
We, us three, should've had
a discussion about it.

48
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,646
We would've figured it out.

49
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,168
But that dickhead just went ahead
and made the choice for us.

50
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,130
- Is that how we do business now?
- I understand you're upset.

51
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,762
And what was that crap about his
uncle with the prison connections?

52
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,806
It's just some bullshit
intimidation move. Come on.

53
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,203
It's true, though.
He does have some connections.

54
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,126
- Is this a problem?
- No. It's nothing to be concerned about.

55
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,487
It came up in the background
I did on him.

56
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,291
Didn't worry me then.
He's just flexing.

57
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,011
All right.

58
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,247
It seems to me that
we have three options here...

59
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,323
...and none of which are ideal.

60
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,370
One, we fire Todd.

61
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,410
- Yeah.
- I'm not a fan of this option...

62
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,929
...seeing that he knows way too much
about this business at this point.

63
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,482
And we'd most likely have to pay him
to keep quiet.

64
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,684
And God only knows
we've got enough of that going on.

65
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,085
Two:

66
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,766
We dispose of him.

67
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,687
Which leaves us option three.

68
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,842
We keep him on payroll.

69
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,607
Put him back on tenting houses,
setting up the lab and so forth.

70
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,048
We keep him close.
Under our control.

71
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,968
Now, option three
would be my choice.

72
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,084
Shall we vote?

73
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,126
I vote three, kid.

74
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,843
You're still in.

75
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,410
Right on. Thank you so much.
You guys totally made the right--

76
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,488
The next time you bring a gun
to a job without telling me...

77
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,042
...I will stick it up
your ass sideways.

78
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,844
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

79
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,126
Hey, boss. What's up?

80
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,241
I was just in the neighbourhood.
Anything going on?

81
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,681
No. He's just hanging out
with his granddaughter.

82
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,729
Well, isn't that sweet?

83
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,844
Here, let me see.

84
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,729
It's a dead drop.

85
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,211
- What?
- A dead drop.

86
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,840
He just stashed something
underneath that trash can.

87
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,924
Write the time down. Roll on it.

88
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,961
Looks like he's leaving.

89
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,804
- Anybody coming for it?
- Nope, not that I can see.

90
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,362
Nobody in sight. Could be hours.

91
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,045
Could be.

92
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,609
What do you want to do?

93
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,327
<i>It's not my fault that Murtha's got
his panties in a twist.</i>

94
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,841
<i>It's an HR issue, Janice.</i>

95
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,566
<i>I read the report.</i>

96
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,520
<i>I'm calling again because that's
the wrong case file number.</i>

97
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,365
<i>All right? I don't know what kind of
shoddy stan--</i>

98
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,040
<i>First off, Miracle Whip
is not mayonnaise, okay?</i>

99
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,527
<i>"Looks like it" doesn't equal
"tastes like it. "</i>

100
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,685
<i>Secondly, every time it's like
they gotta slather an entire</i> jar--

101
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,969
<i>--bastard's screwing with us now.
How'd he make you? What'd you do?</i>

102
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,963
<i>We honked our horns
and yelled "yoo-hoo. "</i>

103
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,044
<i>What do you mean, what did we do?
This guy is slippery as hell.</i>

104
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,282
<i>He's been throwing every tail
we put on him.</i>

105
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,048
<i>- The guy's a pro.
- Yeah, well, even pros make mistakes.</i>

106
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,886
<i>One of these days, our pal
Ehrmantraut's gonna slip up.</i>

107
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,520
<i>Just gotta be there when he does.</i>

108
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,570
Teenagers. Sometimes you
just want to strangle them.

109
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,491
How's it going?

110
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,090
Oh, you know. Well, this little munchkin,
I could just keep her forever.

111
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,642
She is just the sweetest
little baby ever born.

112
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,928
Yes, she is.

113
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,521
I don't see much of Flynn.

114
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,081
That car of his keeps
him pretty busy.

115
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,651
Yeah.

116
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,686
More importantly, how are you doing?

117
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,286
I'm okay.

118
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,249
How's the therapy?

119
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,766
I know Dave helped me so much
when I was going through my little...

120
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,410
How's your guy'?

121
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,925
- Peter.
- Peter.

122
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,287
He's... Yeah, he's good.

123
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,444
I feel like I'm making progress.

124
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,364
That's great.

125
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,082
You know,
you just keep working through it.

126
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,287
Honey. Babe, what is it?

127
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,447
It's okay. It's all right.

128
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,649
Why don't you let me take Holly,
and then we'll talk about this?

129
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,404
- No.
- Okay. All right, that's fine.

130
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,807
Then how about you just talk to me?

131
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,883
Just tell me what's going on.

132
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,485
I just...

133
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,484
I need to make the right decision.

134
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,563
I need them to be safe.

135
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,768
The kids?

136
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,527
They're safe. Of course they are.

137
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,126
I just miss them so much.

138
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,123
I just want to be with them.

139
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,011
Hey, you know we can bring
them back home anytime you want.

140
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,131
No. They need to stay. But I just...

141
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,603
I don't know what to do here. I...

142
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,726
Like, whatever I choose is wrong.

143
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,410
Skyler, you gotta tell me
what's going on.

144
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,601
I know sometimes you--

145
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,482
I know you think I have
a big mouth sometimes. I...

146
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,129
But if you felt like you couldn't
talk to me, I don't know what I'd do.

147
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,809
Okay. So, what's this about
the kids not being safe?

148
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,328
Safe from what?

149
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,242
From us.

150
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,403
From Walt and me.

151
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,928
Like what? Like you're bad parents?

152
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,850
Because you're not. Not even close.

153
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,564
Marie...

154
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,044
...there are things
you just don't know...

155
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,123
...that if you knew...

156
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,130
...you'd never speak to me again.

157
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,130
Try me.

158
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,327
Okay, if you're not
gonna say it, I will.

159
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,643
Skyler, you have to
forgive yourself for Ted.

160
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,441
- What?
- You can't keep beating yourself up...

161
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,127
...over some stupid little affair.

162
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,608
- Walt told you.
- Please don't blame him.

163
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,207
I practically forced him to,
and I wasn't gonna say anything.

164
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,887
But I cannot stand to watch you
torture yourself like this.

165
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,042
You have to forgive
yourself, Skyler.

166
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,248
You were having all these problems
with Walt.

167
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,091
And Ted is a really
good-looking man.

168
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,968
You're only human. Hell,
I've even thought of, you know...

169
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,806
I mean, not seriously,
but I totally get your temptation.

170
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,281
Yeah.

171
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,130
Doesn't it feel good
to get it off your chest?

172
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,449
Oh, yeah.

173
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,402
- I feel better.
- Yeah.

174
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,720
<i>For those who love the taste
but not the price...</i>

175
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,089
<i>...there's simulated caviar
made of kelp, a type of seaweed.</i>

176
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,566
<i>A fraction of the cost, it looks, smells
and tastes similar to the real thing.</i>

177
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,165
Ready to get back at it?

178
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,891
<i>Unlike fish caviar--</i>

179
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,321
<i>We have breaking news
into our newsroom.</i>

180
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,484
<i>We've just learned that police
are now expanding their search...</i>

181
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,723
<i>...for a missing McKinley County boy
after four days with no leads.</i>

182
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,970
<i>Fourteen-year-old Drew Sharp was last
seen by his parents Thursday morning.</i>

183
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,361
<i>Authorities are extending
their search today...</i>

184
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,490
<i>...east from Crownpoint
to Hospah and Whitehorse.</i>

185
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,765
<i>Sharp was last seen riding his dirt
bike into the desert behind his house.</i>

186
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,161
<i>Investigators are asking</i> any--

187
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,171
Jesse, nothing can change this.

188
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,330
- Yeah, it's just that kid's parents...
- I know. Believe me.

189
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,451
I haven't been able to sleep the
past few nights just thinking about it.

190
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,249
But, Jesse, now, finally,
we're self-sufficient.

191
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,448
Finally we have everything
that we need...

192
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,444
...and no one to answer to
except ourselves.

193
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,880
And in a year, year and a half...

194
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,123
...once we've cooked through this
methylamine and made our money...

195
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,444
...there will be plenty of time
for soul-searching. Until then...

196
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,086
...we keep going.

197
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,841
And we run our business our way...

198
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,641
...and make sure that this
never happens again.

199
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,210
Okay?

200
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,606
Look.

201
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,603
Listen, I'll finish this up.

202
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,570
Why don't you go on home?

203
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,246
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

204
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,607
Yeah. I'll take care of this.

205
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,650
You go on.

206
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,365
Hey.

207
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,122
Yeah, I was just leaving.

208
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,125
All right.

209
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,086
Hello? Walter?

210
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,809
What are you doing here?

211
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,486
I'm delivering the batch.
What are you doing here?

212
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,489
Might as well get this over with.
Come in. Join us.

213
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,047
- Hey.
- Hi.

214
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,284
Where's your cars?

215
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,841
We parked around the block.

216
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,571
You might consider
doing that as well.

217
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,851
Okay.

218
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,971
So, what's going on?

219
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,330
Just since this morning, I threw
three separate tails. All DEA.

220
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,522
- What?
- The feds have been all over me.

221
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,490
This has been going on
for a while now.

222
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,926
Did they follow you here?

223
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,048
No. I said I threw them.

224
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,647
I would never come to the headquarters
of our illegal meth operation...

225
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,529
...dragging a bunch of cops, Walter.

226
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,126
- It would be unwise.
- How can you be so sure?

227
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,648
Well, I've been doing this a long time.
It's pretty basic stuff.

228
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,084
How long has this been going on?

229
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,925
Since about the time we started
this little venture.

230
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,562
The DEA, in particular your peach
of a brother-in-law...

231
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,291
...has taken a keen interest
in my activities.

232
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,761
And you're just telling me this now?

233
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,810
What, you didn't think this
information would be of interest?

234
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,691
- Wouldn't be germane?
- I've been handling it, Walter.

235
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,969
We're sitting on a thousand gallons
of stolen methylamine.

236
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,122
Jesus!
How can you be so irresponsible?

237
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,884
Calm down, would you, please?

238
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,601
I can't believe that you kept this from me.
From us. Did you know about this?

239
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,683
- Mike just told me.
- And I said calm down.

240
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,049
- I've got it under control.
- Oh, well, forgive me...

241
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,766
...for not having
complete confidence.

242
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,288
- You know this can't go on, right?
- Yeah, I know.

243
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,408
And I've already decided.

244
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,809
I'm out.

245
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,202
Okay. Well...

246
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,883
Sorry to see you go, Mike.

247
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,441
But I really don't
see any other way.

248
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,045
Neither do I.

249
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,645
Obviously, Jesse...

250
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,566
...you'll have to take over
the distribution end of things.

251
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,806
Mike, I trust that you'll bring Jesse up
to speed on your side of the business?

252
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,486
Yeah, about that...

253
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,563
Actually, Mr. White...

254
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,810
...I'm out too.

255
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,325
You're what?

256
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,810
I don't think I can do this anymore.

257
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,325
So...

258
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,651
...I'm retiring, I guess.

259
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,805
That methylamine that we stole, that we
nearly killed ourselves trying to steal?

260
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,327
That methylamine, when cooked,
is worth nearly $300 million.

261
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,843
And you're telling me that you're
willing to walk away from that?

262
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,923
We're walking away from the meth.

263
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,650
Not the methylamine.

264
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,485
Jesse and I will be taking
our two-thirds and selling it.

265
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,685
I've got a connection, a guy I
knew from my time with Fring.

266
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,051
This guy has the capital,
and he's motivated. Highly.

267
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,522
Mike's thinking we'll clear
like 5 million. Each.

268
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,889
I'll pay off my guys in lock-up
out of my share.

269
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,329
And those legacy costs you're so fond of
you won't have to worry about anymore.

270
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,006
And then I will be going on my way.

271
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,525
Jesse too.

272
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,005
It's a solid plan.

273
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,243
You can come in on this with us.

274
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,331
That'd be cool.

275
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,327
Course, you know, you are free
to hold onto your third...

276
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,084
...and keep cooking.

277
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,801
You'll be selling to my competitors.

278
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,526
This guy and his crew
are way out in Phoenix.

279
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,286
It's a big country, Walter.

280
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,363
Whole lot of meth-heads.

281
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,730
Pennies on the dollar, Jesse.

282
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,121
And that's what you're
gonna sell out for?

283
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,204
Pennies? Why?

284
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,284
Five million isn't pennies.

285
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,124
It's more money than I've ever seen.

286
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,126
And when it comes down to it...

287
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,442
...are we in the meth business?

288
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,728
Or the money business?

289
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,960
Relax, kid. There's no one there.

290
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,929
You sure?

291
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,367
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

292
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,208
Glad to see you could make it out.

293
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,567
I was surprised to get your call.

294
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,768
Good surprise, I hope.

295
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,166
There's one gallon, as discussed.

296
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,687
You take that back home
to your people, test it.

297
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,362
If you're satisfied,
I can get the other 665.

298
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,045
All right. That's fair enough.

299
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,009
Shall we talk money?

300
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,331
That one's free.

301
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,086
The price for the rest
is 15,000 per.

302
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,041
Six hundred and sixty-five gallons,
that's 9,975,000.

303
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,445
Although I would prefer
you round it up to 10.

304
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,729
Makes it easier for my partner
and I to split.

305
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,927
Steep.

306
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,565
We good?

307
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,202
I'll talk to my guys, but I should be
able to put together that cash, yeah.

308
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,805
Good.

309
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,324
I gotta tell you, this is worth it just to
get that blue stuff of yours off the market.

310
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,806
The blue stuff will be
off the market, right?

311
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,162
Now, this whole time,
I was thinking 666...

312
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,130
...that seems like an odd number.

313
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,123
Two-thirds of an even
thousand, though.

314
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,086
When I look at it that way,
it starts to make sense to me.

315
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,248
That's not all the
methylamine, is it?

316
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,771
You two have a partner
you haven't mentioned?

317
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,920
This other party
wouldn't be a problem for you.

318
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,289
- His territory won't impact yours.
- You see, that doesn't work for me.

319
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,808
I'm not just buying this for the supply.
I'm buying this for the demand.

320
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,928
I'm looking to increase
my market share.

321
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,082
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

322
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,211
I want you to tell me that Fring's
blue will be off the streets.

323
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,330
All right.
Here's a new deal for you then.

324
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,929
I'll pay you 15K a gallon
for the full thousand gallons.

325
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,970
Not a drop less.

326
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,086
It's not mine to sell, Declan.

327
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,210
Well, then, no deal, Mike.

328
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,004
Yes?

329
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,763
Yes. I guess.

330
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,608
I don't know.

331
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,047
Why don't you come over here?

332
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,491
To my house.

333
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,165
Yes, seriously.

334
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,087
Hey.

335
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,804
Yo, you sure this is okay?

336
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,088
She's not here. Nobody's here.

337
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,089
All right. So...

338
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,000
Something's come up.

339
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,606
Mike wanted to come here
to give you the hard sell...

340
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,207
...but I figured it'd be better
coming from me.

341
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,085
Mike's connection won't buy
mine and Mike's shares...

342
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,891
...of the methylamine
unless he gets your share too.

343
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,811
He wants the entire
thousand gallons.

344
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,209
Absolutely not.

345
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,651
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

346
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,127
But I've been thinking about it...

347
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,250
...and it really makes sense.

348
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,687
- Kind of.
- It does, does it?

349
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,604
Look, when you started this thing...

350
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,206
...did you ever dream
of having $5 million?

351
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,601
I know for a fact that you didn't.

352
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,049
I know for a fact all you needed
was 737,000...

353
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,931
...because you worked it all out,
like, mathematically.

354
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,446
Look, if selling the methylamine now means
that no one else ever gets killed...

355
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,410
...then I vote for that, man.
Hands down.

356
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,007
And we could have it tomorrow.
We would be out.

357
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,528
Spend time with your family. No more
worrying about them getting hurt...

358
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,570
...or finding out about everything.
Isn't this what you've been working for?

359
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,166
I have not been working
this hard just to sell out.

360
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,006
- It's not selling out.
- Yes, it is, Jesse.

361
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,484
I have-- We have suffered and bled,
literally, for this business.

362
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,164
And I will not throw
it away for nothing.

363
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,367
I don't know how else to say it,
Mr. White.

364
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,967
Five million dollars isn't nothing.

365
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,330
Jesse, have you heard of a company
called Gray Matter?

366
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,609
- No.
- Well, I co-founded it...

367
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,286
...in grad school with a couple
of friends of mine.

368
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,727
Actually, I was the
one who named it.

369
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,491
And back then, it was just--
Oh, it was just small-time.

370
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,722
We had a couple patents pending.

371
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,287
But nothing earth-shattering.

372
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,922
Course, we all knew the potential.

373
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,482
Yeah, we were gonna take
the world by storm.

374
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,723
And then this...

375
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,804
Well, something happened
between the three of us.

376
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,282
And I'm not gonna go into detail.

377
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,365
But for personal reasons
I decided to leave the company.

378
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,650
And I sold my share
to my two partners.

379
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,122
I took a buyout for $5000.

380
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,490
Now, at the time,
that was a lot of money for me.

381
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,367
Care to guess what that company
is worth now?

382
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,164
Millions?

383
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,726
Billions, with a "B."

384
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,922
Two-point-one-six billion
as of last Friday.

385
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,208
I look it up every week.

386
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,531
And I sold my share...

387
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,969
...my potential, for $5000.

388
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,481
I sold my kids' birthright
for a few months' rent.

389
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,450
This isn't the same thing.

390
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,126
Jesse, you asked me...

391
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,080
...if I was in the meth business
or the money business.

392
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,730
Neither.

393
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,128
I'm in the empire business.

394
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,009
I don't know.

395
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,722
Mr. White, is a meth empire really
something to be that proud of?

396
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,209
Skyler, you remember Jesse.

397
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,761
Jesse, this is my wife, Skyler.

398
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,491
Hey, Mrs. White. Good to see you.

399
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,007
You have a lovely home.

400
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,891
- I was just heading out.
- Why don't you stay for dinner?

401
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,691
- No, Mr. White. I'm gonna go.
- Stay.

402
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,126
Come on. It'll be fun.

403
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,044
It's okay with us, isn't it, Skyler?

404
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,885
We don't have anything special
planned tonight.

405
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,525
Yeah.

406
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,005
Sure.

407
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,690
Why not?

408
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,890
See?

409
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,683
These are great green beans,
Mrs. White.

410
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,686
I like that you got
the slivered almonds going.

411
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,650
My mom always made them like that.

412
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,211
You put lemon in there too?

413
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,088
They are from the
deli at Albertsons.

414
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,405
Well...

415
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,806
...you know, good work
on your shopping then.

416
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,447
Because these are choice.

417
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,840
I eat a lot of frozen stuff.

418
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,041
It's usually pretty bad.

419
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,646
I mean, the pictures
are always so awesome, you know?

420
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,531
It's like, "Hell, yeah,
I'm stoked for this lasagna."

421
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,241
And then you nuke it, and the
cheese gets all scabby on top...

422
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,482
...and it's like
you're eating a scab.

423
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,768
I mean, seriously,
what's that about?

424
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,845
It's like, yo, whatever happened
to truth in advertising?

425
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,605
You know?

426
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,123
Yeah, it's bad.

427
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,925
So, hey, how's business?

428
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,169
The car wash. Mr. White said
it's going really well.

429
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,204
Says, like, you're a great manager.

430
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,484
He did, huh?

431
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,962
Yeah, he says you've
got it running like a...

432
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,243
Like a machine. Like, well-oiled.

433
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,925
Yeah.

434
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,285
What else did he tell you about me?

435
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,289
Oh, you know, just good stuff.

436
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,171
Just really, you know,
really good, good stuff.

437
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,051
We don't really talk
that much about...

438
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,846
...you know, personal things.

439
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,642
Did you also tell him
about my affair?

440
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,681
May I please be excused?

441
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,409
You know my kids are gone?

442
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,085
Thank God.

443
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,171
No. I don't mean
they're out for the night.

444
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,525
They're gone.
They're staying with my in-laws.

445
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,729
She made me kick
my own kids out of the house.

446
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,204
She told me...

447
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,850
...that she was counting the days
until my cancer came back.

448
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,241
My wife is waiting for me to die.

449
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,003
This business is all
I have left now.

450
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,564
It's all I have.

451
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,606
And you want to take
it away from me.

452
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,651
I thought you might try
something stupid.

453
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,848
- Look, Mike--
- Don't bother, Walter.

454
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,162
Come join me in the office.

455
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,290
I don't think so.

456
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,090
That's not a request.

457
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,164
Might as well get comfortable.
This deal's going down tomorrow.

458
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,005
It's happening, and there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

459
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,242
- Got it?
- So it's okay for you to steal my--

460
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,926
To ensure that,
you and I are gonna spend...

461
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,970
...the rest of the night together
in this office.

462
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,361
- Like it's my birthday.
- Mike...

463
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,569
When the deal is done, you'll
get your money. I guarantee that.

464
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,691
Let me cook it. I'll double
your five and you still walk.

465
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,606
You know, I have never seen anybody
work so hard not to get $5 million.

466
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,205
Mike, you need to listen to me.

467
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,691
No, Walter. The last thing I need to
do is listen to you. Now, sit down.

468
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,970
All right.

469
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,885
Walter, I've got a bit
of a quandary here.

470
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,886
I've got something I need to attend
to before this deal happens.

471
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,681
But for some reason, I don't trust
you alone with the methylamine.

472
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,047
I'm gonna have to restrain you.

473
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,644
You gotta be kidding.

474
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,609
Stand up for me, please.

475
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,170
Stand up.

476
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,569
Turn around for me.

477
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,011
Arms out to the side. Up.

478
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,201
- Oh, man.
- Sit down.

479
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,325
Sit down.

480
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,883
Give me your wrist.

481
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,800
<i>30")'-</i>

482
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,321
Alrighty.
To what do we owe the pleasure?

483
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,646
Well, gentlemen, we're here to discuss
your illegal harassment of my client.

484
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,320
This should be good.

485
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,280
Mr. Ehrmantraut has become the
subject of a vicious, relentless...

486
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,530
...and unwarranted DEA persecution.

487
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,489
- Gomie, does that sound right to you?
- I have no idea what he's talking about.

488
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,369
Play it as cool as you like, Fonzie.

489
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,683
But we all know you've been
following my client day and night.

490
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,571
The man can't spend a few minutes
with his granddaughter...

491
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,326
...without you guys quivering
in the bushes...

492
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,691
...and peeping through your binoculars.
It's... Well, it's disturbing.

493
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,442
And it's taken a toll on his mental
and physical well-being.

494
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,770
Your client looks fine to me.

495
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,089
Well, some hurts only show
on the inside.

496
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,203
Now, you guys don't even have
warrants for these tails, do you?

497
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,887
Theoretically,
these tails you refer to would be...

498
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,565
...within the bounds of the law.

499
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,166
We don't need a warrant to follow
somebody through a public place.

500
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,046
- Theoretically.
- Yeah, that is theoretically correct.

501
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,450
However, I would counter that an
open-ended, unrestricted surveillance...

502
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,127
...like this amounts to stalking.

503
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,850
Which is illegal.

504
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,520
Now, I don't know what it is
you find so interesting...

505
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,524
...about my client,
and I'm not here to judge.

506
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,730
Different strokes and all.
But sadly, he's just not that into you.

507
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,043
So I have filed for a temporary
restraining order...

508
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,411
...against the DEA
on behalf of Mr. Ehrmantraut.

509
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,640
Where'd you get your law degree,
Goodman?

510
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,805
The same clown college
you got that suit?

511
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,964
You know who likes this suit?
Judge Papadoumian.

512
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,929
She thinks I'm a snappy dresser.

513
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,003
You know what
Judge Papadoumian hates?

514
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,886
Police harassment of
a senior citizen.

515
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,124
<i>30")'-</i>

516
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,328
Expect a visit from
the sheriff, agents.

517
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,245
You should have your ex parte
within the hour.

518
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,204
Let's go.

519
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,363
<i>What kind of judge
would issue this thing?</i>

520
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,967
<i>Papadoumian, man.
She's like Ho Chi Minh</i>

521
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,724
<i>So, what do we do?</i>

522
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,202
<i>Well, not a lot of choice, you know?
We back off.</i>

523
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,847
<i>For the moment. TRO won't stand up
and Goodman knows it.</i>

524
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,005
<i>I don't see what they're playing at here,
but if Ehrmantraut wants a fight...</i>

525
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,487
<i>- ...he's gonna get one.
- All right.</i>

526
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,961
- That was a hell of a gamble.
- Worked.

527
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,767
Yeah, well, not for long.

528
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,606
And he's right about that TRO.
It's gonna get tossed <i>tout de suite.</i>

529
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,321
Meanwhile, Schrader's hard-on for you
just reached Uncle Miltie proportions.

530
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,050
So have fun with that.

531
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,009
How much time I got?

532
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,962
Maybe 24 hours.

533
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,970
It's enough.

534
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,329
It better be. Whatever you got
planned, you best pull the ripcord...

535
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,249
...while you still have a chance.

536
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,410
- Where is it?
- Mike...

537
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,891
- Mike!
- Get out of my way.

538
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,411
You sit down.

539
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,081
- Mike! Mike! Hold on, okay?
- I am gonna count to three.

540
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,288
Mr. White's got an idea.
Mike, I'm serious.

541
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,044
- One. Two.
- It's a great idea.

542
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,091
Look, you get your 5 million, we both do,
and he gets his methylamine, all right?

543
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,685
Just hear him out.

544
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,651
Is that true, Walter?

545
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,002
Everybody wins.
