1
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,075
Come on.

2
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:57,329
Come on.

3
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,581
Come...

4
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:02,625
Come on. Come on, baby.

5
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:08,298
Please, please. Come on, come on.
Come on!

6
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:38,828
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

7
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:09,651
Yeah.

8
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:15,865
Slow down. Slow-- Slow down.

9
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:19,119
And just-- Just take a deep breath.

10
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:20,954
Do it.

11
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:23,206
All right.

12
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:25,959
Now, what happened?

13
00:04:38,763 --> 00:04:42,559
All right. All right. Now...

14
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:47,897
...listen-- Listen to me.
Are you listening?

15
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:51,609
Everything is gonna be okay.
I promise.

16
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:53,862
No, no-- Listen. Calm down.

17
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,572
Just...

18
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:59,993
Sit tight. I know who to call.

19
00:05:27,354 --> 00:05:28,521
Saul Goodman sent me.

20
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:40,909
Come on. Inside.

21
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,126
Watch the door.

22
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:54,964
Where is she?

23
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:26,890
Any other drugs in the house?

24
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:35,857
Think hard.
Your freedom depends on it.

25
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:39,903
What about guns?
You got any guns in the house?

26
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:43,990
Here's your story.

27
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,744
You woke up. You found her.
That's all you know.

28
00:07:48,286 --> 00:07:49,829
Say it.

29
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:55,418
Say it, please. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

30
00:07:58,797 --> 00:08:01,424
Say it. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

31
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:03,510
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

32
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:05,053
Again.

33
00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:07,889
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

34
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:09,683
Again. Again.

35
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:12,852
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

36
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:16,439
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

37
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:23,738
Once you call,
the people who show up...

38
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:26,533
...will be with
the Office of Medical Investigations.

39
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:29,119
That's primarily who you'll talk to.

40
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:31,621
Police officers may arrive,
they may not.

41
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,915
Depends on how busy
a morning they're having.

42
00:08:34,124 --> 00:08:36,626
Typically, ODs are not
a high-priority call.

43
00:08:37,377 --> 00:08:39,087
There's nothing to incriminate you...

44
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:41,631
...so I'd be amazed
if you got placed under arrest.

45
00:08:42,507 --> 00:08:47,262
However, if you do, you say nothing.

46
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,597
You tell them
you just want your lawyer.

47
00:08:49,806 --> 00:08:52,017
Then you call Saul Goodman.

48
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:55,645
And do I need to state the obvious?

49
00:08:57,355 --> 00:08:59,774
I was not here.

50
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:11,619
You put on a long-sleeved shirt...

51
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:13,747
...and cover
those track marks on your arm.

52
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:21,087
Count down from 20,
and then you dial.

53
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:36,895
Hang tough.
You're in the home stretch.

54
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:05,632
Do you want 2-percent or skim?

55
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,719
- Two.
- Two. All right.

56
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:14,099
Thank you.

57
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:19,562
Junior.

58
00:10:24,943 --> 00:10:26,778
Junior.

59
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:29,781
- Flynn.
- What?

60
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:32,409
Flynn.

61
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:36,371
Flynn.

62
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:39,082
I'll be there in a minute.

63
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:45,922
You all right?

64
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:54,305
Flynn, get your butt in here.

65
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:58,351
Oh, my God. Mom, Dad, come here.
You gotta see this.

66
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,562
Seriously.

67
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:07,944
- What?
- Look right there. Look at that.

68
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:11,573
Are those donations?

69
00:11:11,781 --> 00:11:13,450
- Yes.
- Actual donations for your dad?

70
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:21,249
Total strangers gave us $490.

71
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:26,296
Twenty-six people.
Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.

72
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:29,966
Look at this one. Vancouver.
All the way up in Canada.

73
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:33,553
And it's all real, actual money.

74
00:11:34,054 --> 00:11:37,891
It's actually right there
in the PayPal account.

75
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:41,978
And look what they're saying.

76
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:46,483
"Hang in there, Walt." "Good luck."
"Hang in there."

77
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:49,611
Isn't this awesome?

78
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:56,117
That's-- Wow, that is something.

79
00:11:58,036 --> 00:12:00,789
Walt, don't you think
a little thank-you is in order?

80
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:05,085
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son.

81
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:08,505
Thank you. This is a big, big help.

82
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,053
Oh, look, 20 more bucks
from Thunder Bay, Ontario.

83
00:12:15,261 --> 00:12:20,266
Damn. Five hundred and ten dollars.

84
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:31,903
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you.:</i>

85
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:33,113
<i>"Do-not-call list."</i>

86
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:36,116
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

87
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:38,952
How did I know you wouldn't be
answering your phone?

88
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,204
I'm on my way.
I'm gonna be there momentarily.

89
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:47,002
I expect you on the porch, bag packed,
ready to go. No excuses.

90
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:34,341
Sir, you may not wanna
be here for this.

91
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:58,239
I just woke up and I found her.

92
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:00,283
That's all I know.

93
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:02,786
What's her date of birth?

94
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,629
Sir, your daughter's date of birth?

95
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:15,048
April...

96
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:19,135
- April 4th, 1982.
- Okay.

97
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:24,015
And mother's maiden name
and place of birth.

98
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:27,560
- My mother?
- Your daughter's mother.

99
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:30,397
Bishop.

100
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:35,402
- And place of birth?
- Phoenix.

101
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:38,363
Phoenix, Arizona?

102
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:44,285
This is our address.

103
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:46,746
Do you have someone
who can drive you?

104
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:48,373
I can drive.

105
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,542
Well, then if you'd like
to meet us there...

106
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,169
...we can complete the intake
and take our samples...

107
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:55,672
...and then you can make
your arrangements.

108
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,215
Okay?

109
00:14:57,424 --> 00:15:00,969
Now, do you need a card?
Will you both be coming?

110
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:28,538
I don't believe it.
Walt, you have to see this.

111
00:15:28,747 --> 00:15:30,749
- Forty from Te--
- Terre Haute.

112
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:31,958
Walt.

113
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:43,470
<i>It's me.</i>

114
00:15:43,678 --> 00:15:45,805
<i>Are you there? Hello.</i>

115
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:50,268
I'm just checking in.

116
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:54,814
Our friend says
he thinks everything went well.

117
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:57,359
That's-- That's good.

118
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:01,738
So listen. Just call me, all right?

119
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:06,910
Hey, Walt, you've gotta come in here.
We just broke a thousand dollars.

120
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:12,832
All right. I'm coming.

121
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,253
Some of you already know
my brother-in-law. He's a good man.

122
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:20,423
The doctors say this operation
has a real chance of helping him.

123
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:24,886
They're also saying they wanna
be paid in private islands, so dig deep.

124
00:16:25,762 --> 00:16:27,180
Biggest donation...

125
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:30,225
...gets a six-pack
of my very own Schraderbrau.

126
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,936
Home-brewed to silky perfection.

127
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:34,980
Smallest donation
gets two six-packs.

128
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:38,316
All right. Other than Gomie here
pees sitting down...

129
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:39,567
...here's what we know.

130
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:42,153
Christian Ortega, a.k.a. Combo.

131
00:16:42,362 --> 00:16:44,948
Shot dead
by an unknown assailant last month.

132
00:16:45,156 --> 00:16:46,783
"Combo?" I hear you say.

133
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:50,954
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"

134
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:53,790
No. He was a dipshit
wannabe banger.

135
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:56,543
Now, no arrests,
save for stealing a baby Jesus...

136
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:59,337
...from a Knights of Columbus manger
back when he was 17.

137
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:03,508
This dude was so low-rep,
he never showed up on our radar.

138
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:05,552
So why am I talking about him?

139
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:09,180
Anyone? Anyone?

140
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:10,390
Bueller?

141
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,809
- He was dealing Blue Sky.
- That's right.

142
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:15,812
Now, how is it that the purest,
most professional grade...

143
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:20,650
...of meth we've ever come across
is being slung by the likes of that?

144
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,319
But wait. It gets better.

145
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:25,655
Since baby-Jesus thief there
slowed a bullet with his neck...

146
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:27,907
...the blue stuff's
vanished from town, okay?

147
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:31,036
Not a speck to be found
in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?

148
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,624
Well, because maybe
your Heisenberg's in prison.

149
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:39,919
So says A.P.D.
They think they got their man.

150
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:42,547
I know you don't buy it,
but maybe it's true.

151
00:17:42,756 --> 00:17:48,470
James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.
A.P.D. thinks this is our mastermind.

152
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:50,680
You believe that,
I got a bridge to sell you.

153
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:53,516
- He copped to it, didn't he?
- For an extra pudding cup...

154
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:55,060
...every night at Los Lunas?

155
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:57,354
Maybe if you give him
a pack of cigarettes...

156
00:17:57,562 --> 00:18:00,815
...he'll tell you what
he did with Jimmy Hoffa. No, no, no.

157
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:02,317
I've been thinking.

158
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:07,030
Top-shelf product like this?
It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.

159
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:09,157
Raw talent's bound
to pop up somewhere.

160
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:12,035
It's like Whack-A-Mole.
So I've been making phone calls.

161
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:15,622
Local police departments,
small-town sheriffs.

162
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:19,000
Haven't had much luck
inside the Land of Enchantment.

163
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:21,753
But outside,
I've got reports of the blue stuff...

164
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:24,964
...making a scene here in Texas,
Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.

165
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:29,302
In fact, everywhere but here.

166
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:34,432
Almost as if somebody wised up,
stopped shitting where they eat.

167
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,977
Now...

168
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:40,397
...I say Heisenberg's still out there.

169
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:43,566
I say he's gone regional.

170
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:45,986
Only he's still right here in town.

171
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:49,906
Come on, 2800.

172
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:53,410
Come on, big 28. You can do it.

173
00:18:53,618 --> 00:18:56,246
Only 30 more dollars. Thirty more.

174
00:18:57,205 --> 00:19:00,083
Fo-- Forty dollars! Twenty-eight ten.

175
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,751
- Yes!
- Yes!

176
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:06,548
Who's gonna be next?

177
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:08,550
Your guy found him?

178
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,802
Where is he?

179
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:12,012
Okay, listen.

180
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,722
No, no, I don't care.

181
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,557
You have your guy pick--

182
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:17,767
Saul. Just shut-- Saul.

183
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:21,271
Saul, shut up
and give me the address.

184
00:19:24,482 --> 00:19:26,067
I don't recommend it.

185
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:29,404
A.P.D.'s been known
to sit on this place...

186
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:32,282
...keep an eye
on the comings and goings.

187
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,367
Are they here now?

188
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:38,455
Well, I don't see any sign,
but that's the point.

189
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:41,750
Police could be the least of it.

190
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,918
You could just get mugged or shot.

191
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:49,299
How about you go on home, Walter?

192
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:51,509
Let me handle this.

193
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:22,749
Yo.

194
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:23,685
Jesse.

195
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:29,774
Jesse. Jesse. Look at me, son.

196
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:32,902
- Wake up. Wake up.
- Hey.

197
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:36,781
I ain't got nothing for you, man.
It's all gone.

198
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,992
Jesse, damn it, wake up. Just--

199
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,454
Jesse, Jesse. Jesse, it's me.
Okay, it's me. It's Walt. It's Walt.

200
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:43,788
Jesse.

201
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:46,666
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here.

202
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:50,503
No, no, no.

203
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:52,714
- I'm good.
- Come on. Help me out now.

204
00:21:52,922 --> 00:21:56,259
I'm good. I'm good.
Right here, man. Right here.

205
00:21:56,468 --> 00:21:59,637
Listen, Jesse, you are not good
right here.

206
00:21:59,846 --> 00:22:02,015
You are not good at all. You hear?

207
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:05,894
Now, you just put your arms
around me. Come on.

208
00:22:06,102 --> 00:22:07,479
You're gonna stand up...

209
00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:10,148
...and we're gonna
walk out of here, okay?

210
00:22:10,357 --> 00:22:12,400
We're gonna take you
someplace nice and safe.

211
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:15,862
That's it. Now, let's go.
Come on. Here we go.

212
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:45,809
I killed her.

213
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:49,062
- What?
- I killed her. It was me.

214
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,897
- I killed her, man. I killed her.
- No.

215
00:22:51,106 --> 00:22:54,234
Jesse, look at me. Look at me.

216
00:22:54,442 --> 00:22:55,860
You didn't kill anybody.

217
00:22:57,237 --> 00:22:59,531
I loved her.

218
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,870
I loved her more than anything.

219
00:23:15,463 --> 00:23:20,010
No, no. No.

220
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,144
I haven't given much thought
to the programs.

221
00:24:11,353 --> 00:24:13,563
I guess they should be...

222
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:18,318
I don't know.
Just use your best judgment.

223
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:21,946
There's no yellow dress here.

224
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:25,784
It's all-- It's all black and grey.

225
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:30,455
When's the last time you saw her
ever wearing a yellow dress?

226
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:34,292
What about blue?

227
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:37,796
Blue's better than black, right?

228
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:41,633
No, no. Not dark blue. More like...

229
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:45,845
Not super-bright, either.

230
00:24:46,054 --> 00:24:47,722
I mean, blue is blue.

231
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:51,518
No. No cleavage.

232
00:24:52,894 --> 00:24:54,813
Long sleeves.

233
00:24:56,398 --> 00:24:59,275
Yeah. It's nice.

234
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:02,529
It's nice.

235
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:10,036
Big yawn, Holly.

236
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:13,248
I know what you feel like.
I'm tired too.

237
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:18,336
- Okay, sweetie.
- Yes.

238
00:25:20,797 --> 00:25:22,257
Yes!

239
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:24,926
Here we go.

240
00:25:25,135 --> 00:25:28,763
Here we go. Yes.

241
00:25:34,811 --> 00:25:38,189
Would you mind
turning that thing down or off?

242
00:25:38,732 --> 00:25:41,067
Junior. Hey.

243
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,988
The dinging.
Just turn down the volume.

244
00:25:45,196 --> 00:25:49,826
- Dad, it's money.
- Just please do it.

245
00:25:50,035 --> 00:25:52,537
Okay, the noise
is disturbing the baby.

246
00:25:55,332 --> 00:25:57,334
Marie, slow down. I can't--

247
00:25:59,502 --> 00:26:02,505
Oh, my God. You are kidding me.

248
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:06,217
Sure. Of course.
Any day after school.

249
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:10,221
Okay. Wait. I'm gonna-- Let me tell him,
and I'll call you right back.

250
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,806
Okay.

251
00:26:13,516 --> 00:26:15,143
- Guess what.
- What?

252
00:26:15,352 --> 00:26:17,854
- You are gonna be in the newspaper.
- No way.

253
00:26:18,063 --> 00:26:20,065
<i>One of Marie's patients
works at the Journal.</i>

254
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:22,567
She told him about the website
and the donations...

255
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:25,111
...and they're gonna do a story
about you.

256
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,321
- For real?
- Yep.

257
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:29,532
They're coming to interview you
with a photo and everything.

258
00:26:29,741 --> 00:26:31,326
Awesome.

259
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:36,122
- It'll mean more hits.
- And more contributions.

260
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:42,837
East of Scottsdale?

261
00:26:43,046 --> 00:26:45,465
Let me guess. Not talking.

262
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:48,134
Nope. Not a one.

263
00:26:48,343 --> 00:26:51,262
Someone somewhere
is running one tight ship.

264
00:26:53,598 --> 00:26:56,017
All right, chief. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

265
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:57,978
Yeah. You too.

266
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:03,650
Agent Schrader,
can you spare a moment?

267
00:27:03,858 --> 00:27:06,027
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

268
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:11,866
Gentlemen, this is
Supervising Agent Hank Schrader.

269
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:16,162
Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet
Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel.

270
00:27:16,371 --> 00:27:18,123
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

271
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:20,417
Paul Canterna
of Canterna Real Estate.

272
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,460
- Hey, it's a pleasure.
- Good to meet you.

273
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:26,172
And Gustavo Fring
of Los Polios Hermanos.

274
00:27:26,381 --> 00:27:28,466
- Please, just Gus.
- Hi, Gus.

275
00:27:28,675 --> 00:27:30,468
You guys make some killer chicken.

276
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:32,262
Thank you very much.

277
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,973
These gentlemen are underwriting
this year's Fun Run...

278
00:27:35,181 --> 00:27:37,017
...and I thought
I would give them a tour.

279
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:39,811
Absolutely. Get to see
what you're supporting. Thank you.

280
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,105
Can you tell us a little
about your work here?

281
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:43,815
Yes, the Albuquerque office...

282
00:27:44,024 --> 00:27:46,651
...covers everything
from drug-related money laundering...

283
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,612
...to interdiction of illicit substances
crossing the border.

284
00:27:50,196 --> 00:27:53,616
Now, the group that I supervise
focuses on methamphetamine...

285
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:56,828
...which is a growing problem
in the country, unfortunately.

286
00:27:57,037 --> 00:27:59,372
- Terrible.
- Yeah. It is indeed.

287
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:01,166
We've had
some successes locally...

288
00:28:01,374 --> 00:28:03,460
...but overall,
the supply seems to be growing.

289
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:07,255
I gotta tell you, community outreach,
like this Fun Run...

290
00:28:07,464 --> 00:28:09,632
...one of the most powerful
weapons we have.

291
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:11,051
Anything we can do.

292
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:12,677
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Hank.

293
00:28:12,886 --> 00:28:14,012
- Gentlemen.
- Thanks.

294
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,889
Sure. Thank you.

295
00:28:16,765 --> 00:28:18,558
Is this one of your agents?

296
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:22,729
Oh, yeah, no, no,
that's my brother-in-law.

297
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:24,898
He's got a health issue.
We're trying to--

298
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:28,526
Oh, I'm very sorry.
What sort of health issue?

299
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:33,365
- Lung cancer.
- Oh, that's a rough one.

300
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:39,329
- Oh, hey, you don't have to do that.
- Please. Please. I'm happy to do it.

301
00:28:41,414 --> 00:28:43,124
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

302
00:29:01,935 --> 00:29:05,438
Just so you know,
I won't be back for a while.

303
00:29:06,272 --> 00:29:09,234
I'm gonna have
my surgery on Friday.

304
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,239
I'm hopeful it'll go well.

305
00:29:16,282 --> 00:29:19,244
But if not,
Saul will take care of things.

306
00:29:19,452 --> 00:29:22,664
He's got your money.
He's keeping it for you.

307
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,304
Look, Jesse, lingering on things
doesn't help, believe me.

308
00:29:38,513 --> 00:29:42,726
Just try and focus
on getting better, okay.

309
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:45,770
I deserve this.

310
00:29:46,771 --> 00:29:48,231
What?

311
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,111
What you said in the desert.

312
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,032
I get it, what you meant.

313
00:30:01,244 --> 00:30:03,621
I deserve whatever happens.

314
00:30:24,017 --> 00:30:26,019
Oh, shit.

315
00:30:41,534 --> 00:30:43,203
There he is!

316
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:47,082
Walt, they're doing a feature
on Walter Jr.

317
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,668
We called you about 50 times.

318
00:30:49,876 --> 00:30:53,254
Marie, I thought we were just talking
about a newspaper story.

319
00:30:53,463 --> 00:30:56,883
<i>I know. But I thought, you know,
if it's good enough for the Journal...</i>

320
00:30:57,092 --> 00:31:00,637
...then why not TV? So I went for it.

321
00:31:02,013 --> 00:31:03,306
- This is him?
- Yes.

322
00:31:03,515 --> 00:31:04,891
This is Dad. Great.

323
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,353
Let's get everyone on the couch.
I'm thinking Walt Jr. in the middle...

324
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:10,480
...Mom and Dad on either side.

325
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:12,107
Mom and Dad?

326
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,945
How much money
have you raised so far?

327
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:21,199
Six thousand, three hundred
and sixty dollars.

328
00:31:21,408 --> 00:31:23,451
But there's more coming in
all the time.

329
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,496
- Wow, that's amazing.
- We don't even know what to say.

330
00:31:26,705 --> 00:31:30,166
It's just-- It's been incredible.

331
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:32,585
Judging from things you have
written about him...

332
00:31:32,794 --> 00:31:38,508
- ...your dad must be quite a guy.
- Yeah. He is. He's the best.

333
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:41,177
You don't wanna lose him,
do you, Walter?

334
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:45,557
None of us do. We love him.

335
00:31:46,182 --> 00:31:50,520
- He's a good man, isn't he?
- Absolutely. Ask anyone.

336
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:54,607
Anybody. He's a great father,
a great teacher.

337
00:31:54,816 --> 00:31:57,402
He knows everything there is
to know about chemistry.

338
00:31:57,986 --> 00:32:01,906
He's patient with you,
and he's always there for you.

339
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:06,578
He's just decent.

340
00:32:06,786 --> 00:32:10,248
And he always does the right thing.

341
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:13,918
And that's how he teaches me to be.

342
00:32:14,127 --> 00:32:18,923
- Would you say he's your hero?
- Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. Totally.

343
00:32:19,132 --> 00:32:21,760
My dad is my hero.

344
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:31,811
Does that put him to sleep?

345
00:32:32,729 --> 00:32:34,481
This one just relaxes him a little.

346
00:32:34,689 --> 00:32:37,442
We're almost ready.
We'll be taking you in, in just a minute.

347
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:39,277
Okay. Thank you.

348
00:32:43,198 --> 00:32:44,449
Well...

349
00:32:46,242 --> 00:32:49,579
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

350
00:33:08,765 --> 00:33:11,685
Relaxed yet?

351
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:14,020
As a matter of fact...

352
00:33:17,941 --> 00:33:22,779
I don't know what this stuff is,
but it's pretty great.

353
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:26,241
Yeah, it looks like it.

354
00:33:29,077 --> 00:33:31,162
We'll be here when you wake up.

355
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:34,791
Well, I'll be looking for you.

356
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,669
They'll probably want me
to take your glasses.

357
00:33:37,877 --> 00:33:39,587
Yeah, you better.

358
00:33:40,255 --> 00:33:44,134
Yeah, okay. Okay. I got them.

359
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:47,679
Where's your phone?

360
00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:50,098
Your cell phone. Did you bring it?

361
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:52,017
Which one?

362
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,734
I'm pretty sure
he didn't bring it, Mom.

363
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,696
Okay.

364
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,400
Well, first things first.

365
00:35:23,608 --> 00:35:25,944
How old is that baby now?
When do I get to meet her?

366
00:35:26,152 --> 00:35:29,114
I was actually thinking
of bringing her today, but...

367
00:35:29,322 --> 00:35:31,533
She's 7 weeks tomorrow.

368
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:32,742
- Seven, right?
- Yeah.

369
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:37,455
Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture...

370
00:35:37,664 --> 00:35:39,499
...here somewhere.

371
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:43,336
- She's beautiful.
- Thanks.

372
00:35:43,545 --> 00:35:46,256
Always a relief to say that
and actually mean it.

373
00:35:47,674 --> 00:35:51,261
- How's your pain level, Walter?
- It's...

374
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:53,471
Very low, basically.

375
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,557
Shortness of breath?

376
00:35:55,765 --> 00:35:58,518
- A bit, but much better.
- Good.

377
00:35:59,686 --> 00:36:01,438
Well, your margins look good.

378
00:36:01,646 --> 00:36:03,148
I can't foresee the future...

379
00:36:03,356 --> 00:36:05,150
...but even
conservatively speaking...

380
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:07,986
...I can say that you bought yourself
some real time here.

381
00:36:09,154 --> 00:36:11,573
There's no reason
not to be optimistic.

382
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,575
That's great.

383
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:17,370
That is great. Thank you, doctor.

384
00:36:18,747 --> 00:36:22,167
So when could he get back
to his normal routine?

385
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,711
- He can ease into it now.
- Okay.

386
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:30,342
- And can he go back to work or...?
- I'd give it a few more weeks.

387
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:34,721
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
and continue to get plenty of rest.

388
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:37,515
But he can be on his own?

389
00:36:37,724 --> 00:36:40,977
I mean, just more,
you know, independent.

390
00:36:41,436 --> 00:36:43,980
Yes. Use your best judgment.

391
00:36:44,814 --> 00:36:46,107
Well...

392
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:48,902
Now, that's good news
for you, huh, honey?

393
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,404
One less baby in the house.

394
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,959
- Don, hey.
- Hey, Stew.

395
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:07,629
Hey, welcome back.

396
00:37:07,837 --> 00:37:09,798
Thanks. It's good to be back.

397
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:16,388
Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear.

398
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,349
Yes. Thanks.

399
00:37:19,683 --> 00:37:21,768
Terrible thing. Just...

400
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:25,689
But, you know, we've all been
thinking about you, and...

401
00:37:25,897 --> 00:37:28,566
- You been doing okay?
- I'm doing okay.

402
00:37:28,984 --> 00:37:32,487
After a certain point,
time off doesn't help...

403
00:37:32,696 --> 00:37:36,241
...so I figured I'd rather be here.

404
00:37:36,783 --> 00:37:40,745
- Focus on work.
- Sure. Absolutely.

405
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:42,706
Yeah.

406
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:45,709
Well, see you inside.

407
00:37:47,252 --> 00:37:50,714
Continue to descend through 1500.

408
00:37:50,922 --> 00:37:53,925
Headed downwind for a left base
on Runway 17.

409
00:37:54,134 --> 00:37:57,887
Number 26-Tango,
descend to maintain 13,000.

410
00:37:58,096 --> 00:38:01,850
Truth or Consequences altimeter,
two-niner-niner-eight.

411
00:38:02,058 --> 00:38:06,938
Pima 311, contact
Albuquerque Center 134.6.

412
00:38:07,147 --> 00:38:10,650
Juliet-5-Bravo, ident, say altitude.

413
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:15,488
Juliet-5-Bravo, roger.
Clear direct to Winslow.

414
00:38:15,697 --> 00:38:18,283
I think I may just keep this.

415
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:19,576
Sky?

416
00:38:21,244 --> 00:38:22,746
What do you think?

417
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:26,624
Doesn't look so bad, right?

418
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:30,128
What are you doing?

419
00:38:30,337 --> 00:38:32,881
I'm going to Hank and Marie's
for the weekend.

420
00:38:35,091 --> 00:38:36,968
- Since when?
- I'm taking the baby with me.

421
00:38:37,177 --> 00:38:39,095
Marie will pick up
Walter Jr. from school.

422
00:38:39,846 --> 00:38:42,724
You'll have the house to yourself
for two days.

423
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,894
I want you to pack your things
and leave.

424
00:38:46,853 --> 00:38:48,104
Why would I do that?

425
00:38:48,313 --> 00:38:51,483
Hank has offered to help. You shouldn't
be doing any heavy lifting.

426
00:38:51,691 --> 00:38:54,152
- Skyler.
- I want you gone by Monday morning.

427
00:38:54,361 --> 00:38:55,779
I want--

428
00:38:56,196 --> 00:38:57,405
I want you gone.

429
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:11,127
Okay. Can you at least tell me why?

430
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,464
Because you're a liar, Walt.

431
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:18,301
Two cell phones, after all.

432
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:20,762
What?

433
00:39:20,971 --> 00:39:23,932
Before your surgery, I asked
if you had packed your cell phone...

434
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:28,019
...and you said, "Which one?"

435
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,480
When?

436
00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:33,233
Skyler, I was medicated.

437
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:35,610
I mean, I could have said
the world was flat.

438
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:36,820
You know what I think?

439
00:39:38,738 --> 00:39:41,908
I think you accidentally
told the truth.

440
00:39:42,283 --> 00:39:44,995
Honey, we have been over this.

441
00:39:45,203 --> 00:39:47,163
Asked and answered, right?

442
00:39:47,372 --> 00:39:50,291
Then it got me thinking again...

443
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,087
...about all the strange behaviour.

444
00:39:54,295 --> 00:39:56,756
Not the least of which
was the disappearance.

445
00:39:56,965 --> 00:39:59,426
Out of my mind with worry,
calling hospitals...

446
00:39:59,634 --> 00:40:01,553
...checking the morgue.

447
00:40:02,387 --> 00:40:04,556
Your fugue state?

448
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:09,728
I had to believe that, didn't I?

449
00:40:10,228 --> 00:40:12,689
I had to find a way.

450
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:18,570
I mean, who would lie
about such a thing?

451
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:20,572
You tell me, Skyler.

452
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,867
You tell me exactly what it is
you think I'm lying about.

453
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:27,245
What? I'm having an affair.
Is that what you think?

454
00:40:27,454 --> 00:40:29,664
Yeah. For the last few weeks.

455
00:40:29,873 --> 00:40:32,542
With whom?
Who am I having an affair with?

456
00:40:32,751 --> 00:40:35,128
Well, my guess
was Gretchen Schwartz.

457
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,674
Something was going on between you.
I just knew.

458
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:43,428
Jesus. Skyler. Get me a Bible
to swear on, if that's what it takes.

459
00:40:43,637 --> 00:40:45,430
I am not having an affair
with Gretchen.

460
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:48,683
I know. I know you're not.
Because I asked her.

461
00:40:52,479 --> 00:40:54,773
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

462
00:40:54,981 --> 00:40:56,900
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

463
00:40:57,859 --> 00:40:59,277
So I finally left a message:

464
00:40:59,486 --> 00:41:03,323
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

465
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:05,950
I thought that'd get her attention,
and it did.

466
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:09,746
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

467
00:41:11,247 --> 00:41:13,625
The money for your treatment...

468
00:41:14,918 --> 00:41:18,838
...Gretchen and Elliott
didn't give you a dime.

469
00:41:20,507 --> 00:41:22,258
They paid for nothing.

470
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:24,886
You refused every offer
they made you.

471
00:41:25,095 --> 00:41:26,388
But that didn't make sense...

472
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:29,057
...because I checked with Delcavoli
and the hospital...

473
00:41:29,265 --> 00:41:32,560
...and not including your surgery...

474
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:34,771
...we're nearly paid up.

475
00:41:35,105 --> 00:41:37,816
Over $100,000.

476
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:43,655
Out of where? Out of thin air?

477
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:53,873
But then...

478
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:57,544
...I called your mother.

479
00:41:59,629 --> 00:42:01,172
Yeah.

480
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:04,050
Thanks for that too.

481
00:42:04,718 --> 00:42:07,053
But I thought, you know,
maybe she has some money...

482
00:42:07,262 --> 00:42:11,349
...that I don't know about.
Maybe she contributed.

483
00:42:12,726 --> 00:42:14,602
It's possible.

484
00:42:16,771 --> 00:42:21,234
It turns out that not only is the money
not from your mother...

485
00:42:21,443 --> 00:42:26,489
...she didn't even know
that you have cancer.

486
00:42:29,743 --> 00:42:32,037
You never went to see her.

487
00:42:33,705 --> 00:42:35,790
I dropped you at the airport.
I picked you up.

488
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:37,417
You were gone for four days...

489
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:41,421
...and yet she swears...

490
00:42:41,963 --> 00:42:44,257
...that you were never there.

491
00:42:49,012 --> 00:42:53,350
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

492
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:56,269
Skyler.

493
00:42:57,354 --> 00:42:59,147
Could you...

494
00:43:00,106 --> 00:43:02,067
...just once...

495
00:43:04,944 --> 00:43:08,657
...do me the courtesy
of not denying it?

496
00:43:17,832 --> 00:43:19,417
Skyler.

497
00:43:21,086 --> 00:43:22,754
Skyler, don't do this, please.

498
00:43:22,962 --> 00:43:25,215
I...

499
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:28,343
Skyler, please don't go.

500
00:43:37,185 --> 00:43:41,898
If I tell you the truth, will you stay?

501
00:43:43,984 --> 00:43:46,820
Stay, and I will tell you everything.

502
00:43:48,154 --> 00:43:49,990
Whatever it is...

503
00:43:51,116 --> 00:43:53,076
...I'm afraid to know.
