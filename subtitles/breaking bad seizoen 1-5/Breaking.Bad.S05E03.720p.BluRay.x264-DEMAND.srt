1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,446
- Hey, Darla. How you doing today?
- Hey, Dan.

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,367
- I'm looking for something in a Markowski.
- That'd be Dennis Markowski?

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,204
That's the one.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,646
Oh, and I've got my paralegal
with me today.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,087
Paralegal? Coming up in the world.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,730
You know it.

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,090
Hey, Dennis.

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,045
Have a seat.

9
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,164
You hear about Chow?

10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,966
- Yeah, people say he skipped town.
- He's dead.

11
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,486
It wasn't me.

12
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,367
It wasn't a message.
It wasn't payback.

13
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,445
It was a mistake made by a third party
who has since been dealt with.

14
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,726
You got it?

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,405
- Yeah.
- Second thing.

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,643
The deal you had with Fring,
it's still in place.

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,086
Okay.

18
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,844
Don't "okay" me.

19
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,883
You got something to say?

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,769
Mike, I'm keeping my mouth shut.

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,564
The laundry
was right above the lab.

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,802
There's no way I could say
I wasn't in on it.

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,167
I'm looking at eight years minimum.

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,201
But I'm doing my time
like I'm supposed to.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,283
I'm no rat, and you know it.

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,602
I mean, what else is there to say?

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,922
All due respect,
what are we talking about here?

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,321
The deal is the deal.

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,130
How's the deal the deal?

30
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,527
The feds took away my hazard pay.

31
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,730
My wife asks me where the mortgage
is coming from. I got nothing to tell her.

32
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,450
I knew the risks. We all did.

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,204
But that wasn't the deal.

34
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,284
And I know for a fact
they got Holt and Perez yesterday.

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,125
Now, it's not gonna be me,
but absent the hazard pay...

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,568
- ...sooner or later, someone's gonna flip.
- No one's flipping.

37
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,246
Everyone gets their hazard pay,
including you.

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,564
I appreciate what you're saying
and all, but the man is dead.

39
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,967
Okay? The lab's a
hole in the ground.

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,280
- I just don't see it.
- I've got something new.

41
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,444
It's just starting up.
It's gonna make you whole.

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,648
Something new?
With the feds looking at you?

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,848
- How?
- "How" is my business.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,082
Hanging tight's your business.

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,490
Your family's gonna be fine.
You will be made whole.

46
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,688
Now, you got my word.

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,811
You need more?

48
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,801
No, Mike. I'm good.

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,841
- Who's next?
- That's your choice.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,810
A.P.D.'s got Martinez across town
McGann's up in Sandoval.

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,645
The Sandia tribal cops
are holding him for the feds.

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,925
And Holt and Perez
are in lockup in Los Lunas.

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,481
You don't mean
to get to them all today?

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,290
Yeah, I do.

55
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,529
Hey, let's go! Open up!

56
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,644
Back here.

57
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,809
Oh, hi. How was your day?

58
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,448
Are you moving back in?

59
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,962
Yeah. I'll keep the condo for now.

60
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,681
Selling it in this market,
I'd get killed.

61
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,083
But, yeah, I'm home.

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,801
It's time.

63
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,566
Do you really think
that's a good idea?

64
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,689
Yes.

65
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,651
So you bring him here? Come on.

66
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,802
The three of us,
we're the three amigos.

67
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,281
All for one, one for all.

68
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,091
We don't need a fourth amigo.

69
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,966
Saul, Mike knows the business.
He knows distributors.

70
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,606
- Mike's okay.
- He's okay?

71
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,364
He said he was gonna
break my legs.

72
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,091
And don't tell me
he didn't mean it, okay?

73
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,971
Because he gave me
the dead mackerel eyes. He meant it.

74
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,521
Saul, Mike threatened me.
He threatened Jesse.

75
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,524
He probably threatened someone
before breakfast this morning.

76
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,729
It's what he does.
Come on. Grow a pair.

77
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,408
Let it be noted
that I do this under duress.

78
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,806
Duly noted.

79
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,645
All right. Let him in, Huell.

80
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,127
Mike, I'm extending you--

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,006
Now that we're all together,
here are the ground rules.

82
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,369
Division of labour.
I handle the business.

83
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,966
Making the stuff, that's your end.

84
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,404
I don't tell you how to mix
your chemicals and whatnot...

85
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,690
...and you do not tell me
how to take care of business.

86
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,684
Is that absolutely clear?

87
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,048
- Sure.
- All right. Let's take the tour.

88
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,486
Hey, you're okay with that?

89
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,527
Yes.

90
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,605
He handles the business,
and I handle him.

91
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,807
Clearly, we're talking
about renting, not buying.

92
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,691
You need an ongoing business,
someplace you can slide in...

93
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,367
...do your thing and remain anonymous.
I'm not gonna mince words.

94
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,727
This is your best bet.

95
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,204
Got machines running, forklifts,
people coming and going.

96
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,931
You're gonna stay
way under the radar.

97
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,687
And the owner's solid.
He can't wait to throw up a curtain wall...

98
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,810
...stack some boxes in front of it,
give you the space you need.

99
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,486
After that, he's got his business,
you've got yours...

100
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,483
...and never the twain shall meet.

101
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,768
It's outstanding. Am I right?

102
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,810
Machines like this,
gotta be plenty of power.

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,240
What about the smell?

104
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,970
More good news.

105
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,203
I've been here when it's up and running.
This place stinks already.

106
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,488
- You'll blend right in.
- How many employees?

107
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,801
I knew you'd ask.

108
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,490
Sixteen illegals, all highly motivated
to stay deaf, blind and dumb.

109
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,409
You'll want to vet them, I'm sure.

110
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,762
Yes, indeed.

111
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,929
So, what do you say, maestro?

112
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,764
Is it unanimous?

113
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,049
You know, I worked in a box factory
one summer in high school...

114
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,727
...and I haven't seen
one of these in years.

115
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,769
Trip down memory lane.
That's perfect.

116
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,285
You know what this is?

117
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,283
It's a corrugator.

118
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,331
It uses steam and salt to crimp
kraft paper for cardboard.

119
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,927
And it makes a hell of a racket
doing it, which is great. Right?

120
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,525
No.

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,845
Steam and salt.

122
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,129
When this thing is running,
it's like a jungle in here.

123
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,045
Shit. It'll ruin the product.

124
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,087
You can't just pop down to Costco
and get a couple dehumidifiers?

125
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,201
What--? Fine. Fine. Moving on.

126
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,409
Spacious, isolated location,
no humidity...

127
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,722
...and you get all
the free tortillas you want.

128
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,565
That's the special
feature of this place.

129
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,804
I don't know.

130
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,281
It'll make the tortillas
smell like cat piss.

131
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,920
Somebody's bound to notice that.

132
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,323
All right. Well, there's gotta be
some kind of workaround, right?

133
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,006
It's a technical problem.
You guys are technical guys.

134
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,322
You know, be creative.
Put your heads together.

135
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,485
Anything food-related is gonna have
unannounced government inspections.

136
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,206
All I'm asking
is that you keep an open mind.

137
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,722
Danny's already set some space aside
behind the Skee-Ball games.

138
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,610
- No.
- Hell, no.

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,082
I know it's a long shot.

140
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,329
All I can say to recommend this...

141
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,486
...is we're talking about an owner here who
is, how should I put it, highly amenable.

142
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,607
Look, I get it. Just say no
and we'll go get dinner.

143
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,001
All right. So I'll start.

144
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,889
No way we're cooking in here.

145
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,884
No space, nowhere for
the smell to go.

146
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,647
Look at that door. That thing rolls
up and we're open to the world.

147
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,370
I don't know if anybody noticed...

148
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,966
...but there's a cop shop
a quarter of a mile away.

149
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,881
The hammer comes down,
it's gonna be Custer's Last Stand.

150
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,451
- It's perfect.
- What?

151
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,762
How are we gonna fit a lab in here?

152
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,171
Who said here?

153
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,881
A house is infested.

154
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,010
Termites, cockroaches, whatever.

155
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,482
Homeowners hire
a pest control company.

156
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,723
Truck rolls up, homeowners leave.

157
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,848
The crew tents the house.

158
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,520
They bomb the place with poison.

159
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,569
The house stays like that for days.

160
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,041
No one looks twice
at a tented house.

161
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,567
Now, maybe there's a strange smell
coming out of it.

162
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,563
Does someone think
to investigate? No.

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,049
Does anyone go inside? Hell, no.

164
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,929
And that's where we'll cook.

165
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,767
They tent, what,
three, four houses a week?

166
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,207
So we pick the one
that's best for us.

167
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,448
Enough floor space, easy access.

168
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,161
Once the tent is up,
we go in, we cook a batch...

169
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,523
...we bomb the place and leave.

170
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,968
So we gotta move
in and out for every cook?

171
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,801
Set up a lab, cook,
and then take everything down?

172
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,129
It's challenging, but doable.

173
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,487
Tell me about these guys.

174
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,201
Mr. Ponytail on the sidewalk, that's Ira.
He's the owner. On the roof is Sandor.

175
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,284
The ladder's Fernando,
and down below, that's Todd.

176
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,161
The pest control operation is legit.
I mean, they're licensed, they're bonded.

177
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,641
They do as good a job
as anyone in town.

178
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,605
But they're also top-drawer
second-storey men.

179
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,809
- "Second-storey"?
- B and E artists.

180
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,928
They're burglars.

181
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,889
Yeah. I mean, hey,
they play it smart.

182
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,441
They don't boost anything
while they're on the job.

183
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,888
They copy the keys,
locate the valuables and alarms...

184
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,324
...and they sell that information to other
crews. Or, after a decent interval...

185
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,087
- ...they'll lift the goods themselves.
- And you know them how?

186
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,451
Oh, I've been pulling their chestnuts out of
the fire, legally speaking, for five years.

187
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,127
Ira and his guys are good. I mean,
they know how to keep their mouths shut.

188
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,442
And if you buy them,
they're gonna stay bought.

189
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,722
You can check into them yourself.

190
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,327
I will, if it comes to that.

191
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,285
So do we take a vote?

192
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,450
Why?

193
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,201
- We sound great.
- Rock on, man. Solid.

194
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,801
That Yamaha's got a real nice touch.

195
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,531
You like the sound? It's huge, huh?

196
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,684
Yeah, it's real nice, but we're
looking for something else today.

197
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,127
- You got any roadie cases?
- For sure. What size?

198
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,691
Biggest you got.

199
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,241
That'll fit through, like,
a regular-size doorway.

200
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,084
You got it. Follow me.

201
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,964
Top of the line.

202
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,727
Recessed hardware, foam lining,
quarter-inch laminated walls...

203
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,689
...3-inch casters.

204
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,041
Height is good, width is good.
How much weight will this hold?

205
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,009
It's rated for 900 pounds.

206
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,243
So unless your band plays lead
bricks, you should be okay.

207
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,483
We're gonna need...

208
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,644
Hey, man, I'm trying to do business
over here, bitch.

209
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,886
Sorry. He's, like,
overly enthusiastic.

210
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,328
Anyway, I'm gonna need four of them.

211
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,121
Four? That gonna be layaway? Because
I need to see a bunch of IDs for that.

212
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,009
No, man, cash.

213
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,844
Okay. Hey, you know what?

214
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,169
I'll throw in stencilling.
What's your band called?

215
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,726
Damn, brother.

216
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,282
Not asking no questions, but it sure
looks like you're back in business.

217
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,960
No joke.
You way back in business, man.

218
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,645
Look at this.

219
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,686
Yeah.

220
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,046
You're stacking the benjies
till the rubber band pops.

221
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,480
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,211
All's we're saying is
we know you're major league now...

223
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,840
...but if there's ever anything else
you need from us...

224
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,441
Any way we can get
in on this at all.

225
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,921
Little stuff, big stuff...

226
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,162
We would be all over it.

227
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,124
You know, maybe someday.

228
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,601
That's cool.
I guess we better hit it then.

229
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,728
Yeah. Keep on keeping on, brother.

230
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,166
Later.

231
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,761
<i>Okay, it is the same job as always.</i>

232
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,561
You go out, you inspect, you deal
with the customers, regular drill.

233
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,169
Everything's the same,
except for one important detail.

234
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,847
- No stealing.
- No stealing.

235
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,123
Not a toothpick, not the spare
change between the couch cushions...

236
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,489
...not the panties out of the hamper.
Nothing. And I mean nothing.

237
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,440
If you're out with your buddies and they
ask if you got a hot tip on a B and E...

238
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,126
...you tell them you got nada.
You're out of the game.

239
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,251
The bottom line is that these houses
are out of bounds, now and forever.

240
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,005
Got it?

241
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,571
All right.

242
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,485
From time to time,
you're gonna see these two.

243
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,041
Now, as far as you're concerned,
they are ghosts.

244
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,168
You don't see them.
You don't hear them.

245
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,725
You don't say "good morning."

246
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,248
You don't speak
unless you're spoken to.

247
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,488
On the other hand,
if they tell you to jump...

248
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,962
...you don't ask what for,
you jump.

249
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,645
Now, you need a name for them?

250
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,530
You call them
"Yes, sir" and "No, sir".

251
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,320
You got any problems,
you come to me.

252
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,803
Here's the deal.
The finishing tank's a tight fit.

253
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,282
- And with this motor you've got on top...
- The agitation motor.

254
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,201
The agitation motor here on top,
the tank's not gonna fit in the box.

255
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,483
It's just... It's just too tall.

256
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,120
You know, I thought we'd put
a collar on the tank...

257
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,767
...and carry the motor in separately,
alongside the condenser.

258
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,722
And on the day, we just kind
of twist it into place...

259
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,042
...you know, while we're setting up.

260
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,283
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

261
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,643
- That's good.
- Yeah.

262
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,290
That will work.

263
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,681
And Joe and his guys can
build it, right?

264
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,689
Yeah. You know, they're up for it.

265
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,320
Joe already bought a TIG welder
for the aluminium work.

266
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,691
And, you know, I figure if they can pull
off the magnet, they can handle this.

267
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,604
Now, listen, about the smell...

268
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,923
About keeping it out of people's
drapes and furniture and whatnot...

269
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,969
When I was down in Mexico...

270
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,647
...there was this big, big,
plastic hospital tent...

271
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,041
...they set up inside of the--

272
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,049
Oh, shit. Sorry.

273
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,770
Oh, hi. Sorry.

274
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,888
No, no, no.
We were just wrapping up.

275
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,482
- This is my...
- Friend. Hi. Walt.

276
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,210
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

277
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,966
This is Brock.

278
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,929
Hi, Brock. I'm Walt.

279
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,923
I've heard a lot about you.

280
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,081
- Hi.
- Hi.

281
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,242
I understand you were
in the hospital.

282
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,688
And Jesse told me
that you were very brave.

283
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,085
Yeah. A man of few words.

284
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,686
I'm sorry. He mostly just wants
to play his game.

285
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,251
Oh, I know that.

286
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,569
I have two of my own.
A boy and a girl.

287
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,850
Well, I should go.

288
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,844
I was thinking I could make us
all some dinner.

289
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,729
Are you sure you don't wanna...?

290
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,645
Yeah. Why don't you stay
for a beer at least?

291
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,686
Sure. Why not? A beer sounds good.

292
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,285
Thank you.

293
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,609
- How are you today, sir?
- We're good. Good. How are you?

294
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,683
- Family all packed up, ready to go?
- Yeah.

295
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,331
Here you're acknowledging
that you've removed all pets...

296
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,324
...and plants from the house
and that food has been removed...

297
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,767
...or double-sealed in the bags
we provided.

298
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,130
This acknowledges you've removed or
bagged any medicine, tobacco, pet food.

299
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,681
Better make sure
you got any medicine you might need.

300
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,330
- It's already in the car.
- Okay.

301
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,689
Holy crap.
How much poison are you using?

302
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,565
It's not how much,
it's getting it where it's needed.

303
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,489
Those are your foggers.

304
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,842
They disperse the fumigate
into the structure...

305
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,321
...where it'll eliminate any nymphs
or larvae...

306
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,801
...as well as the
full-grown blattodea.

307
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,850
So do we have all your keys?

308
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,048
Any extras on here
you might wind up needing?

309
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,884
- No, I'm good.
- Okay.

310
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,089
This last one here acknowledges
that you have been informed...

311
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,248
...that you may not
reenter the premises...

312
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,880
...until it has cleared
the post-fumigation inspection.

313
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,369
So you're gonna get them all, right?

314
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,565
We'll kill them dead.
That's a guarantee.

315
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,886
Sir? Sir?

316
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,166
Yes?

317
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,211
There's a nanny cam
in the living-room clock.

318
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,727
I disabled it.
I just thought you should know.

319
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,844
- What's your name?
- Todd, sir.

320
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,010
Cheers.

321
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,931
You know, I've gotta say...

322
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,250
...seeing you with Andrea
and that little boy...

323
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,766
It was nice.

324
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,566
- Yeah. It's good, right?
- Yeah.

325
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,882
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

326
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,327
And the way she looks at you...

327
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,962
- You think?
- Oh, definitely.

328
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,929
So is it moving
in any particular direction?

329
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,762
I don't know. Maybe. Yeah.
You know, sometimes I think...

330
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,445
...you know...

331
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,046
...if it feels right, then...

332
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,969
If it feels right, it feels right.

333
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,722
Sometimes you just
gotta listen to your gut.

334
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,924
I mean, instant family.

335
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,448
What more can you ask, right?

336
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,364
Absolutely.

337
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,208
<i>Cut the cards.</i>

338
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,526
Have you thought about
what your plan is?

339
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,971
You know, vis-à-vis honesty?

340
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,202
You mean how much
she knows about this?

341
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,408
She doesn't know anything.

342
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,724
I mean, you know, she's not stupid.
She knows I'm into something, but...

343
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,326
She could make
a pretty good guess.

344
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,244
But I never told her anything.

345
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,649
I'm not gonna.

346
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,564
Okay.

347
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,045
I mean it.

348
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,689
I know you do.

349
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,047
Jesse, I can't pretend that this
doesn't affect me. It does.

350
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,885
But with everything that
we've been through, the two of us...

351
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,322
...this has to be your decision.

352
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,090
I mean, you've earned that.

353
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,844
Seriously?

354
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,205
Yeah.

355
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,402
Secrets create barriers
between people.

356
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,606
I'm speaking from experience,
believe me.

357
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,403
All that you've done...

358
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,289
...it's a par': of you, and...

359
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,927
I mean, if you choose to spend the
rest of your life with this person...

360
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,209
...then you'll have to decide
how much you'll share with her.

361
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,605
Meaning what? Like everything?

362
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,929
Like Gale?

363
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,765
I'm just trying to say
that I trust you...

364
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,243
...and I know you'll
make the right call.

365
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,042
If she loves you...

366
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,483
...she'll understand.

367
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,328
They're leaving streaks.

368
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,245
This more ethnic-looking one,
he's doing a great job...

369
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,325
...but the other one is going back and
forth like he's scrubbing a wall.

370
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,165
They have to go in circles...

371
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,203
...or you're going to leave streaks.

372
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,801
That's pretty basic, right?

373
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,529
I don't mean to tell
you your business.

374
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,924
It's just-- It's simple
quality control.

375
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,964
So I've got some good news.

376
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,401
Guess what.

377
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,320
What?

378
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,526
No, really. I want you to guess.

379
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,802
- Marie, I really--
- Okay. Hank's back at work.

380
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,523
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

381
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,684
Sure, they love him now, but where
were they when he needed them?

382
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,764
Merkert and all the rest, they
laughed him out of the office...

383
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,367
...when he told them
about that chicken man.

384
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,524
As far as I'm concerned,
too little too late.

385
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,842
If it were me, I'd tell them all
to go to hell.

386
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,362
Do I sound bitter?

387
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,443
But it's what he wants, right?

388
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,329
Yeah, it's doing him good.

389
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,121
I mean, his PT is going gangbusters.

390
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,044
He's hardly using his cane at all.

391
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,010
And thank you for that, really.

392
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,200
I mean, God knows where he'd be if we
had to go through his health plan.

393
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,603
I'm just glad he's feeling better.

394
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,321
So, speaking of which,
we have another big event coming up.

395
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,648
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

396
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,044
Walt's birthday.

397
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,441
Whatever you need, I'm here.

398
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,642
Yeah. I...

399
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,007
I don't think we're gonna
do anything this year.

400
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,043
What are you talking about?

401
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,049
Of course we're gonna do something.

402
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,722
Skyler, he was diagnosed
around his birthday, right?

403
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,326
I--

404
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,369
So it's been a whole year.

405
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,488
Listen, I've had my problems
with Walt.

406
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,610
Why he wouldn't come to the house
when we were all practically--

407
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,364
Whatever. Water under the bridge.

408
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,046
But at this point, every
year is precious. We are--

409
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,690
What are you doing?

410
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,851
You don't smoke.
You haven't smoked since college.

411
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,411
You can't be serious!

412
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,206
With the baby and Walt?

413
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,648
You're not smoking around the baby,
are you? And you can't smoke here.

414
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,201
There's gotta be some rule
or regulation, I'm sure.

415
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,085
You can't force your employees
to breathe secondhand smoke.

416
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,330
- I know for a fact that that is illegal.
- Marie, shut up.

417
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,767
What? I'm sorry...

418
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,526
...please don't speak to me like that.
I am simply saying--

419
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,650
Will you shut up?
Shut the hell up.

420
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,406
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

421
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,528
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Please stop--

422
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,251
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

423
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,368
Shut up! Shut up!

424
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,522
Shut up!

425
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,564
That's 5.23.

426
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,007
Five-point-two-three.

427
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,526
Last one.

428
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,768
Five-point-two-six.

429
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:42,051
That comes to 49.27.

430
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,446
Good yield, right?

431
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,331
That is an excellent yield.

432
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,884
All right.

433
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,404
Hey, Marie.

434
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,844
How you doing?

435
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,890
- Where is Skyler?
- In the bedroom. She's resting.

436
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,527
Is everything okay?

437
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,480
- Breakdown? What does that mean?
- It means I don't know what else to call it.

438
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,042
But I've never seen
her like that, ever.

439
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,522
Well, what did she say
when she was yelling?

440
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,920
Nothing.

441
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,967
She just yelled, "Shut up, shut up,"
over and over again.

442
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,611
Did you know she's smoking?

443
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,562
Occasionally, maybe.
It's not a regular thing.

444
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,205
- I just wish I had gotten your message.
- Messages, Walt.

445
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,807
Plural. I probably
called you five times.

446
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,565
I'm not leaving here until I know
what's got her so upset.

447
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,164
Are you gambling again?
Is that what this is?

448
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,200
Please, God,
tell me the cancer isn't back.

449
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,445
No.

450
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,330
- It's not the cancer.
- Well, something happened.

451
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,088
I don't mean to point the finger, but
this didn't just come out of nowhere.

452
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,722
It's time to tell me the truth, Walt.
All of it.

453
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,525
I mean it.

454
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,644
You're right.

455
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,527
You heard about Ted Beneke?

456
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,125
The accident?

457
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,282
What accident?

458
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,527
A couple weeks back,
Ted took a fall, a bad one.

459
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,808
He gave himself a concussion...

460
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,361
...and fractured a couple vertebrae.

461
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,489
He's still in the hospital.

462
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,971
He may never walk again.

463
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,206
Oh, my God. I didn't know.
I'm so sorry to hear that.

464
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,600
Yeah.

465
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,601
But that couldn't
explain Skyler's...

466
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,767
Yes. Yes, it could.

467
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,568
You do know, right? You...

468
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,809
You must know.

469
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,044
Oh, God.

470
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,762
She was having an affair.

471
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,244
With Ted Beneke.

472
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,880
Listen. It wasn't...

473
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,608
It wasn't ongoing
or anything, and...

474
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,170
Skyler and I have been trying...

475
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,527
...to put things back together.

476
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,089
And then the accident happened,
and she got...

477
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,201
Marie, I'm begging you.
Please keep this to yourself.

478
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,887
I don't want Hank to think
less of her. Or me.

479
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,003
When did you...?

480
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,086
Was she--? I'm gonna go.

481
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,765
Okay. All right.

482
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,605
Thank you.

483
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,285
- I'm sorr--
- No.

484
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,602
<i>That looked nasty.</i>

485
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,404
Hey, you okay?

486
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,564
I'm good.

487
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,009
Really?

488
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,650
Yeah.

489
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,646
<i>Come on. You wanna fuck with me?
Okay.</i>

490
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,529
<i>You little cockroaches.</i>

491
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,125
Dad, wait.

492
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,410
<i>You</i> wanna <i>play games?
Okay. I play with you. Come on</i>

493
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,927
- This is it.
- Wait. Wait for it.

494
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,610
<i>- Ready?
- Yo u wanna play rough? Okay!</i>

495
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,207
<i>- Say hello to my little friend!
- "Say hello to my little friend."</i>

496
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,161
Nice. Just--

497
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,164
Hey, Mom, feeling better?

498
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,966
Hey. Hey, why don't you join us,
if you feel up to it?

499
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,771
We have popcorn.
I think there's some pizza left.

500
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,570
If you're up to it.

501
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,121
Yeah, Mom. Join us.

502
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,483
- Oh, my God. Look. Look.
- You whores!

503
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,563
Everyone dies in this movie,
don%they?

504
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,209
Okay.

505
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,089
For you and you and me.

506
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,289
Three hundred and sixty-seven
thousand dollars each.

507
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,528
Wait a minute.

508
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,523
After the dealers got their cut...

509
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:08,165
...we should be
looking at 1,379,560.

510
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,884
Mike, you're short.

511
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,963
You're almost 300,000 short.

512
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,209
You're forgetting about the mules.
They get a flat 20 percent.

513
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,691
- The what?
- The drivers.

514
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,208
They're the ones that take the
product from us to the dealers.

515
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,167
And so transportation
is worth 20 percent?

516
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,288
They're taking a risk.

517
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,446
Two hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars' worth of risk?

518
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,288
What did Gus pay his mules?

519
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,006
Gustavo Fring didn't use mules.

520
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,446
He didn't need them.

521
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,604
He spent 20 years
building his own distribution.

522
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,003
He had 16 refrigerator trucks
running his product.

523
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,362
And do you know
where they are now?

524
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,249
Government impound.

525
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,802
You don't like paying 20 percent?
Maybe you shouldn't have killed the guy.

526
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,844
Hey, hey. There's still over
a million bucks here, all right?

527
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,168
That's for one cook.

528
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,607
And since you're putting on
the green eyeshade...

529
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,007
...my supplier and I
came to an agreement.

530
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,288
The methylamine is free this time.

531
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,604
But brace yourself, because
the next barrel is gonna cost big.

532
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,163
Can we continue, or you got any more
burning questions?

533
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,731
Okay, kid.

534
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,451
You fronted us 120 to get us going.

535
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:33,207
So that's 40 from him and me.

536
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,283
One hundred and twenty.

537
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,283
Yes. Thank you, Jesse.

538
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,525
Okay.

539
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,685
Now, Ira gets 110
for our piece of the business...

540
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,047
...and <i>25</i> per cook.

541
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,120
That is 45...

542
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,807
...from each of us.

543
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,842
Ira's guys get 10 each per cook.

544
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,805
Goodman's cut, 18,000 from each.

545
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,251
Legacy cost, $351,000.

546
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,289
That's 117,000 each.

547
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,010
"Legacy cost"?

548
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,764
I got nine guys

549
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,123
You don't know them, but they were
part of the previous operation...

550
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,409
...and they know a lot.
And right now, some of them are in jail...

551
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,201
...and more will be soon.
The feds RICO-ed their hazard pay.

552
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,762
So we are gonna make them whole.

553
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,762
We are gonna make them whole?

554
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,570
What is this "we"?

555
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,121
These were Gus' employees,
not ours.

556
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,608
They might have been Gus' employees,
but they're my guys.

557
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,280
So, what are they doing
to further our interests?

558
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,569
The cops are looking at them
very closely.

559
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,088
We don't want them
furthering our interests.

560
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,767
So we are paying them, why?

561
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,045
Because it's what you do.

562
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,481
It's what you do.

563
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,850
My guys are keeping
their mouths shut.

564
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,525
We make them whole.

565
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,446
One hand washes the other.
It's as simple as that.

566
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,288
It sounds like a simple shakedown...

567
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,562
...simple as that.

568
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,724
We're paying for their silence.
That's blackmail.

569
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,601
Business is my end.

570
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,201
This is business. End of story.

571
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,207
This is your problem.
It should come out of your end.

572
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,125
Hey. Hey. Just take it out of mine.

573
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,368
All right? Go for it.

574
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,122
I don't care. Just take it.

575
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,326
No. Jesse, thank you...

576
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,682
...but no.

577
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,330
I'll pay my share.

578
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,885
Go ahead.

579
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,809
Let me tell you something.

580
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,485
This...

581
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,044
...is how it's gonna be
from here on out.

582
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,770
My guys are an ongoing
expenditure...

583
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,208
...so you best get yourself
comfortable with it.

584
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,487
A hundred and thirty-seven thousand.

585
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,848
That's less than with Fring.

586
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,484
Listen, Walter.
Just because you shot Jesse James...

587
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,087
...don't make you Jesse James.

588
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,089
Tomorrow.

589
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,723
How are you feeling?

590
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,646
Okay, I guess.

591
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,489
Broke it off with Andrea.

592
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,844
I had to.

593
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,330
She's gonna tell Brock.

594
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,007
I'm still gonna take care
of the rent and stuff.

595
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,960
- It's the right thing to do, but, you know--
- I meant this.

596
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,327
How are you feeling
about the money?

597
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,526
You're looking at it wrong.
When we worked for Gus...

598
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,041
...we were cooking
200 pounds a week.

599
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,683
This last batch was great,
but we didn't even crack 50 pounds.

600
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,242
We maybe cleared less money,
but we got a bigger piece of the pie.

601
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,603
It's like you said, we're owners,
not employees.

602
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,368
I've been thinking about Victor.

603
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,686
Yeah?

604
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,891
Yeah.

605
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,127
All this time...

606
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,443
...I was sure that
Gus did what he did...

607
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,489
...to send me a message.

608
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,047
Maybe there's another reason.

609
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,523
Like what?

610
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,924
Victor trying to cook
that batch on his own?

611
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,321
Taking liberties
that weren't his to take?

612
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,564
Maybe he flew
too close to the sun...

613
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,244
...got his throat cut.
