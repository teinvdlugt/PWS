1
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:27,688
- Where do we look?
- I don't know. Everywhere.

2
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,232
Where should we start?

3
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,033
Maybe this is something.

4
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,623
Umbrellas?

5
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:53,547
The Kahala Hilton, July 1969,
men on the moon.

6
00:02:54,924 --> 00:03:00,971
August 9, 1974,
I first lay eyes on Mimsi.

7
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,641
- Weird.
- Yeah. Heh.

8
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,454
James.

9
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,623
- What did you do?
- I just hit a button.

10
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,583
Hit it again.

11
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,840
There's gotta be a way to turn it off.

12
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,514
My little coconut.

13
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,809
James.

14
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,024
Laura said something
on her tape about a coconut.

15
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,819
Oh, my God. The necklace.

16
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:23,845
Okay, Laura,
this is where you shot that video.

17
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,557
Now just tell me,

18
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:31,186
tell me why you sent me
to Sparkwood and 21?

19
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,028
Oh, my God.

20
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,982
No.

21
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,475
- Red 36.
- Sorry, I guess our date's off.

22
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,904
Sir, are you absolutely sure
you want another card?

23
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,781
Yes, please.

24
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,375
Twenty-one, can you beat that?

25
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,797
Mother always said I was born lucky.

26
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,395
Maybe later.

27
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,980
Thanks for asking.

28
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,155
This is for you.

29
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,747
I'm a friend of Leo's.

30
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,791
Who's Leo?

31
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,585
Buy you a cocktail, Jacques?

32
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,770
Come in.

33
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,697
Turn around.

34
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,203
Yes, very nice.

35
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,872
Come over here.

36
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,176
Something wrong?

37
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,886
Uh-uh.

38
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,513
This is a good night for you
to break in.

39
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,974
The owner's coming by tonight,

40
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,810
he likes to spend some time
with all the new girls.

41
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,397
- Who's that?
- No names, child.

42
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,442
You don't offer and you don't ask.

43
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,068
Yes, ma'am.

44
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,699
Pick a card.

45
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,177
Jacques,
how long you been dealing blackjack?

46
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,721
Long enough to spot a card counter.

47
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,932
You always let
card counters buy you a drink?

48
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,518
I don't see tips like that every day.

49
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,937
Leo ever mentioned me to you?

50
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,814
I don't know, mister. Who are you?

51
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,901
I can't believe
Leo never told you about me.

52
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,238
Maybe he did, I don't know.

53
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,406
Leo played you like a violin.

54
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,283
Had you and your brother
taking all the risk

55
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,993
running the product
across the border.

56
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,787
Never cut you in
on a piece of the action.

57
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,455
I don't know
what you're talking about.

58
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,291
Take that chip out of your pocket
and a look at it.

59
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,126
Go ahead.

60
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,129
That chip has a special significance.

61
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,424
A very special night
you spent up at your cabin.

62
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,592
Here's a clue:

63
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,221
"Laura, Laura."

64
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,558
Take it easy. Take it easy.

65
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,476
How do you think
a low-rent hump like Leo's

66
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,478
been financing this little operation?

67
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,775
- You.
- I'm the bank.

68
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,529
- He never mentioned your name.
- Course not.

69
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,905
Leo makes the buy with my cash.

70
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,949
You and your brother mule it
across the border.

71
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,201
He ever tell you
who was distributing stateside?

72
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,161
No. Some high school kid,
that's all I know.

73
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,329
That's right.

74
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,999
We're in sync now, Jacques.
Can you feel it?

75
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,794
- Can you?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

76
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:52,382
Good, because I've got a job for you
across the border tonight.

77
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,844
No Leo. No middleman.

78
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,014
It's ten grand.

79
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,433
Half now, half on completion.

80
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,934
How's that sound?

81
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,105
Sounds good.

82
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,524
What are we doing?

83
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,153
You meet me at the water-processing
plant on Black Lake in two hours.

84
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,447
- Is that gonna be a problem?
- No.

85
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,699
- No problem.
- Good.

86
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,373
One more question, Jacques.

87
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:30,003
You know, Leo told me all about
that night at the cabin with the girls.

88
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,174
I'm curious about the chip,
how'd that happen?

89
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,219
It was that crazy bird.

90
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,973
- Bird?
- It had a thing for Laura.

91
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:46,561
Saying her name all the time.
Like he's in love or something.

92
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,063
So we're all partying.

93
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,399
Girls are all getting pretty high,
everybody's pretty crazy.

94
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,734
You, Laura and Ronette.

95
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,489
Leo lets Waldo out of the cage
and the bird, he lands on her shoulder.

96
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,492
Laura, she's all tied up.

97
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:05,288
She liked that, the bird,
he starts pecking on her shoulder,

98
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,416
pecking like love pecks or something,
you know what I mean?

99
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,584
So Leo,

100
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,586
he's doing a number on her

101
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:15,256
and Laura,
she's screaming about that damn bird.

102
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,593
So Leo takes out a chip.

103
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,097
Puts it in her mouth and says:

104
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:28,269
"Bite the bullet, baby. Bite the bullet."

105
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,693
Thanks for clearing that up.

106
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,612
Yeah, no problem.

107
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,781
See you on the other side.

108
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,449
Can do, Cappy.

109
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,127
Got a trout on the line, Hawk.

110
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,171
This one's a keeper.

111
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,011
I'm just gonna sit right here, okay?

112
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,347
Come here, sweetie.

113
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,975
Look, we got all night, baby.

114
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,147
Ow.

115
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,784
You made me do this, Shelly.
You made me.

116
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,712
Is Lucy talking to you yet?

117
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,381
As we say
in the law enforcement game,

118
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,926
it's a cold trail.

119
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,846
Agh. Women.

120
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,600
Harry, Hawk here.

121
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,895
The trout's heading upstream
towards the net.

122
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,649
Hawk, hold the line.
We'll set the hook.

123
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,400
You got a twenty on Agent Cooper?

124
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,277
He's downstream
about ten minutes.

125
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:45,573
He'll probably miss the catch,
but he'll be there when we grill him.

126
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,825
Copy that.

127
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,912
We'll make our move as soon
as the big fish shows his fins.

128
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,500
- Ready, Andy?
- Ready, Harry.

129
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,849
Jacques, keep your hands
where I can see them.

130
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,725
Put them on the roof of the car, now.

131
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,352
You heard him.

132
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,189
Get in there and cuff him.
Don't move.

133
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,149
You're under arrest.

134
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,944
For the attempted murder
of Ronette Pulaski

135
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,947
and the murder of Laura Palmer.

136
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,283
Give me your other hand.

137
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,662
- He's got my gun.
- Harry, look out.

138
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,959
- My shoulder.
- Andy.

139
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,628
- Call an ambulance?
- Are you okay, Harry?

140
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,547
- Yeah.
- Shut up, you're all right.

141
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,965
Better call that ambulance.

142
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,426
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Yeah.

143
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,512
Anything you say can and will
be held against you in a court of law.

144
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,055
You have a right to an attorney.

145
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,811
Hello.

146
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,106
All clear.

147
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,275
Be there as soon as I can.

148
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,491
Hey, what's up, doc?

149
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,286
It's Laura,
in case you haven't guessed.

150
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:18,207
It's Thursday the 23rd
and I'm so bored.

151
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,836
Actually, I'm in kind of a weird mood.

152
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,341
God, James is sweet,
but he's so dumb.

153
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:31,012
And right now,
I can only take so much of sweet.

154
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:38,227
Hey, remember that mystery man
I told you about?

155
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:44,025
Well, if I tell you his name,
then you're gonna be in trouble.

156
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,028
He wouldn't be such a mystery man
anymore,

157
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,198
but you might be history, man.

158
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:55,203
I think a couple of times
he's tried to kill me.

159
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,538
But guess what?

160
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:02,043
As you know, I sure got off on it.

161
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,881
Isn't sex weird?

162
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:13,721
This guy can really light my F-l-R-E.

163
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,599
As in red Corvette.

164
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,103
Uh-oh.

165
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,314
Here comes Mom
with milk and cookies.

166
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,482
Donna.

167
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,150
- Later, Lawrence.
- Dad?

168
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,778
Bye-bye.

169
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,073
I've got an emergency at the hospital,
I don't know when I'll be back.

170
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,908
See if your mother
needs anything, huh?

171
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,910
- Okay. All right, Dad.
- I'll call later.

172
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,832
James.

173
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,377
It's okay, I'm glad I heard her say it.
I'm glad.

174
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,879
I might have gone my whole life...

175
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,426
- I'm sorry you had to hear that.
- I'm okay.

176
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:55,013
Jacoby didn't kill her.
He was trying to help her.

177
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,016
Then how'd he get the necklace?

178
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,569
You hear that?

179
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,409
You've got about one hour
to think about what you've done to me.

180
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,287
And think about it.

181
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,333
Because by then
Bobby Briggs is gonna be dead.

182
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,924
You broke my heart.

183
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,195
Goodbye.

184
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,246
It's all here.

185
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,915
Pretty generous, Josie.

186
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,794
Sitting in that concrete box
all that time,

187
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,047
90 grand seemed like
all the money in creation.

188
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,134
Kept me going.

189
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,680
It's a funny thing.

190
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,642
Back in the world, I don't know,

191
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,604
seems kind of light.

192
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,233
We had an agreement.

193
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,990
I've been going over this
in my mind and...

194
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,160
See, if you could follow my thinking,

195
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,412
we're all born into life,

196
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,080
and we have
a certain number of years

197
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,209
to move and breathe
and have our being.

198
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,587
That's from a book
on Oriental philosophy

199
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,964
I read when I was in the joint.

200
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:22,470
And maybe somebody somewhere
knows how much time we have.

201
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,597
I don't, do you?

202
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,436
So when a man gives up
a certain portion of his life...

203
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,896
Eighteen months, for instance.

204
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,274
- How does he place a value
on that time?

205
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:40,446
Eighteen months, 90,000,
what's that?

206
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,406
Five thousand a month?

207
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,159
Well, that's not bad, if you're gonna
live another 40 or 50 years.

208
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,411
But what if you only got another 20?

209
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,163
Or ten?

210
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,334
Or some unforeseen event
killed you tomorrow?

211
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,254
As in the case
of the boating accident

212
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,090
that killed your late husband,
Andrew.

213
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,055
Or say you just got out of prison,

214
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,766
where you went in for, uh,

215
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,521
vehicular manslaughter
as part of an agreement

216
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:17,191
to avoid being implicated in the
commission of a much greater crime.

217
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,859
Murder.

218
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,946
For which in fact
you were responsible.

219
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,031
But now there's this threat,

220
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:29,453
this possible threat
that this fact could be discovered.

221
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,707
And in one stroke ten
or 15 or 20 more years of your life

222
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,376
could be cut right off
from underneath you.

223
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,504
So I've been asking myself:

224
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:44,051
"What does that do
to the market value of 18 months?"

225
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,723
We had an agreement.

226
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,019
And we still do, sweetheart.

227
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,855
Signed, sealed, delivered.

228
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,525
And I'm gonna take care
of everything we agreed to.

229
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,902
See, you want a lot for your money.

230
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,406
And I want a lot for my time.

231
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,869
You know,
there's a saying in the joint.

232
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,747
It's not Oriental philosophy,

233
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:19,587
but it has a similar kind of logic that
appeals to my, uh, spiritual nature.

234
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,756
Once you're in business
with somebody,

235
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,050
you're in business for life.

236
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,427
Like a marriage.

237
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,404
Partner.

238
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,141
Damn.

239
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,937
Where is it? Where is it?

240
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,605
Catherine?

241
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,650
The account ledger,
have you seen it?

242
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,654
Well, don't you keep it
in that little safe at home?

243
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,615
No, it's not in the safe at home,
it's not here, it's not anywhere.

244
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,826
Tell me you didn't take it.

245
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,244
I didn't take it.

246
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,206
Pete, tell me the truth.

247
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,000
You're not helping her
to pull something here.

248
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,002
- Who?
- Josie.

249
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,922
Well, no.

250
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,717
Pull what here?

251
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:53,472
Oh, Peter, forget everything that we've
ever said or done to hurt each other.

252
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,516
Just like that?

253
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,768
Temporarily.

254
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,687
I know our marriage
is a living train wreck.

255
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:04,275
But there used to be something
caring between us.

256
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,777
The fellow who caught my eye.

257
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:11,699
The lumberjack who could
scamper up a tree like a cat.

258
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,704
The boss' sister
from that big house on the hill.

259
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,500
A summer's indiscretion
and here we are.

260
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,668
Catherine.

261
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,256
Oh, Pete.

262
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:31,802
I never should have taken you
to that house up on the hill.

263
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,390
Well, I have no complaints
about the house.

264
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:43,189
As for me, taking my principle pleasure
in lashing out at the one person

265
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,773
who was decent enough
to stand by me

266
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,317
through all my foolishness.

267
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,570
I know things haven't
been easy for you.

268
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:58,913
Peter, if somewhere
under all that scar tissue

269
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,957
there's the faintest flicker
of what we used to feel for each other,

270
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,585
I'm asking you to feel that now.

271
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,087
Why?

272
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,798
Exactly.

273
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,010
Because I'm in trouble.

274
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,263
And given what I've become
and the way I've treated people,

275
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,599
there's no one else I can turn to.

276
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,643
I need your help.

277
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,817
Catherine. Catherine.

278
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,955
So Fred starts
to put the cuffs on him, right.

279
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,123
Now Harry, he turns to go.

280
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,460
Now all of a sudden, Jacques throws
an elbow at Fred like this: Wham!

281
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,672
And in one move, takes Fred's gun

282
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,465
and he's got the drop on Harry.

283
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,677
Harry is deader
than a pound of roadside stew.

284
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:59,682
Then all of a sudden,
a single shot rings out.

285
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,894
All right.

286
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,605
- Andy, my man.
- All right, Andy.

287
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,655
Go ahead, Andy, give it your best shot.
Go on.

288
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:00,117
- Oh, Andy.
- Oh, Punky.

289
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,037
I'm pregnant.

290
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,973
Uh-oh.

291
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,062
Fresh coffee.

292
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,785
- What?
- Let me talk to the sheriff.

293
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,745
I'm sorry,
the sheriff isn't in at the moment.

294
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,831
I expect him back shortly,
would you care to leave a message?

295
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,253
You tell him Leo Johnson
said to check out James Hurley.

296
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:57,091
- He's an easy rider.
- An easy rider?

297
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,094
- You got that?
- Yes, I've got that, but Leo?

298
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,137
Wait, Leo?

299
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,559
Dr. John Vincent, ICU,

300
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,520
Dr. John Vincent, ICU.

301
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,857
Did you take Laura and
Ronette up to your cabin that night?

302
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,945
You know they'd both been up there
before, they was no nuns.

303
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,948
Is that where you took the pictures
for Flesh World?

304
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,950
Yeah, that was Laura's idea.

305
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,953
She talked Ronette into,
uh, making them ads.

306
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,580
What did you and Leo fight about
that night?

307
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,459
Bastard, he hit me
with a whiskey bottle.

308
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,627
Why?

309
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,213
I don't know why.
That's why we fought. Heh.

310
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:40,509
I'm bleeding like a stuck pig,
and he's laughing.

311
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,262
So you used Leo's shirt
to stop the bleeding. What then?

312
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,431
I got sick.

313
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,976
I go outside, pass out.

314
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,311
I wake up, I'm lying on the ground.

315
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,313
Where was Leo?

316
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,859
Leo and the girls,
they were gone. Ha, ha.

317
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,694
What about the train car?

318
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,155
I don't know nothing about that.

319
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,950
I come down the hill,
Leo's car's gone.

320
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:10,456
Had to walk 15 miles
back to my own house. Heh.

321
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,172
When they brought him in,
he was rambling incoherently.

322
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,341
These things he said to you,
they're pretty incredible.

323
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,511
I know, let's hope he pulls through.

324
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,014
Well, he's stabilized anyway.

325
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:31,643
So Leo had to take the girls
to the train car by himself.

326
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,105
- You believe him?
- He's too stupid to lie.

327
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,691
He'll testify against Leo. We got him.

328
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,027
We've gotta find Leo first.

329
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,572
- Doc, how's Jacoby?
- He's out of the woods.

330
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,368
Listen, he, uh... He says he got
a phone call from Laura Palmer.

331
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,370
He was on his way to see her
when he was jumped.

332
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,914
That brought on the heart attack.

333
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:55,209
- Any description of the assailant?
- He didn't see him.

334
00:29:55,376 --> 00:30:00,005
But he says he saw Laura Palmer
standing by the gazebo in Easter Park.

335
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:10,808
It's not here. It's not here.
It's not here either. Damn.

336
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,102
Ahh.

337
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,356
Midge.

338
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,400
Midge Jones.

339
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,653
What are you doing?

340
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:27,574
It's, uh, my old high school yearbook.

341
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,078
I thought it was gone forever.

342
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,579
Oh, Pete.

343
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,207
Sorry.

344
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,924
What?

345
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,261
- It's at the mill.
- What is?

346
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,721
What you're looking for.

347
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,015
Drying shed 3, near the north gate.

348
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,852
Pete.

349
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,025
Guess I'll look in the other room.

350
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,240
What do you want? Talk terms.

351
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,201
We'll let you know.

352
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,807
Hey, Norma, do you still have
that big down comforter on your bed?

353
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,559
Yes, Hank.

354
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,854
Mattresses they give you
on your bunk,

355
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:43,483
they're probably yay thick, you know.

356
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:47,446
And you lie there at night thinking,

357
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:51,074
"If this mattress's so skinny,
how'd they get all those rocks inside?"

358
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,537
So, uh, you'll forgive me if I tell you

359
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,290
that, uh, night after night,

360
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:03,295
I dreamed of you lying there
on that big feather bed.

361
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,928
I guess the, uh,

362
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,806
hired help shouldn't be so familiar
with the boss lady, huh?

363
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,767
I can't blame you for dreaming.

364
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,355
I wasn't just dreaming
about being with you, Norma.

365
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,523
What I was trying to...

366
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,819
I shouldn't even be saying
this much, heck.

367
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,363
I think you should.

368
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,282
No, I haven't earned the right,
Norma.

369
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,036
- I've been back what, two days?
- Say what you wanna say.

370
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,919
I've been trying to picture
a whole life with you.

371
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,462
With the diner.

372
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,007
Making it soar. Making it blue sky.

373
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,722
I always talk too big.
That's my biggest fault.

374
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,558
I learned that talking
to my counselor inside.

375
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,186
This is new territory for me.

376
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,564
But I'm gonna try Norma.

377
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:09,027
You know, it's 20 years
we've been together next month.

378
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,237
Can you believe it?

379
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,281
Maybe we're doing this
all backwards.

380
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:16,576
Maybe it's the next 20 that counts.

381
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:22,582
Give me time, Norma,
I'll make you proud of me yet.

382
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,021
Nadine?

383
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,903
Nadine?

384
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,865
Honey?

385
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,748
Oh, God, Nadine. Don't you do this.

386
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,708
Nadine.

387
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,383
I need an ambulance.
My wife has just taken some pills.

388
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,469
422 Riverside.

389
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,637
For the love of God, hurry.

390
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,099
Stay with me, Nadine.

391
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,272
Please don't go.

392
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,985
Stay with me.

393
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,619
Leo Johnson's gone underground.

394
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,662
My bet is he's holed up
somewhere near his home.

395
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,874
Sheriff, Leo Johnson called.

396
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,292
- When?
- About ten minutes ago.

397
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,044
He left this message.

398
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,464
And sheriff, in the background,
when I spoke to him,

399
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,800
I could hear a clock striking.

400
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,343
What kind of clock, Lucy?

401
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,096
It sounded like
the clock at Easter Park.

402
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,473
- Harry.
- Hawk.

403
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,682
Good work, Lucy.

404
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,684
Hawk, pull the surveillance
off Leo's house,

405
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,853
I want you to set up a perimeter
around Easter Park.

406
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,021
Got it.

407
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,107
I'll radio.
You get some cars over there.

408
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,567
- Harry, I gotta talk to you.
- Sure.

409
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,694
Harry, let me talk to James.

410
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,988
You wanna investigate this?

411
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,366
Come on, James.

412
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,578
Harry.

413
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,790
Harry, is it true?

414
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,792
You've found him.
You've got the killer?

415
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,919
We've arrested a suspect, Leland,
that's all.

416
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,838
But is it the man, Harry? Is it him?

417
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,257
We can't release
any details right now.

418
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,384
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

419
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,886
Leland,
there's nothing you can do here.

420
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,681
You should be home
with Sarah now.

421
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,725
Well, yes, you're right.
Of course, you're right.

422
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:49,604
- You going back to the hospital?
- No. I'm heading home.

423
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:53,400
- Thank you, Will.
- Don't give it a thought.

424
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,411
Hospital.

425
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,290
Think you ought to listen to this tape.

426
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,875
Why is that?

427
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,502
It was Laura's. We found it.

428
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,422
I think it'll help you find
who you're looking for.

429
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,591
Who might that be?

430
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,594
Somebody with a red Corvette.

431
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,764
Dr. Jacoby's in the hospital
with a heart attack.

432
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,602
- Heart attack?
- He said he saw Laura Palmer tonight.

433
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,272
James, what kind of dangerous game
have you been playing?

434
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,942
Is Jacoby gonna be all right?

435
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,119
I've been very patient with you,
James.

436
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:51,917
From here on out, I'm gonna need
a better set of answers.

437
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,925
Let's start with why this was
in the gas tank of your bike.

438
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,645
Fine, fine, fine.

439
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,356
- Okay, okay.
- Uh-huh.

440
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:18,485
- Ghostwood. Fantastic. I love it.
- Mm! Ha-ha-ha.

441
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,154
All your revisions are included.

442
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:25,033
Ben, I am so happy
I can't even say how much.

443
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:33,041
- After you.
- No, no, no, after you.

444
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,919
- After me.
- Ha-ha-ha.

445
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,298
Excuse me.

446
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,260
Benjamin Horne here.

447
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,096
Time to Black Flag that little firebug.

448
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,015
Leo Johnson's
gonna get a house call.

449
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,809
Proceed.

450
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,533
Shelly?

451
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,162
Shelly, are you here?

452
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,709
Shelly's not here, Bobby.

453
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,044
Leo, man, am I glad to see you.

454
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,046
Was there something
I could help you with?

455
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,717
Actually, it's you I was looking for,
the cops, man, they're after you.

456
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,385
Liar.

457
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,725
- Shelly's dead. You killed her.
- Aah! Unh!

458
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,770
No, Leo.

459
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,082
Later, Leo.

460
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,999
I can't understand
a word you're saying,

461
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,293
you have a thing in your mouth.

462
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,933
- Who are you?
- Shelly Johnson.

463
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,143
You know who called me here?

464
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,979
No, I don't know anything,
please help me...

465
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,982
Be quiet, I'm thinking.

466
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,153
Oh, God.

467
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,824
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

468
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,090
Oh, God.

469
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,263
- Any of the boys still inside?
- Not sure. Shift was over.

470
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,849
But we're still trying to get a count.

471
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,185
- Seen Catherine?
- No, Pete.

472
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,937
That's her car.

473
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:07,982
Jesus God,
you think she's still inside?

474
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,486
I guess I'm gonna have to find out.

475
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,282
Pete, that ain't such a good idea.

476
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,498
She's still my wife.

477
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,678
Catherine.

478
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,139
And that is that.

479
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,937
- Ben, is this a great moment?
- Ghostwood.

480
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,315
Incredible. Ghostwood. Huh?

481
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,781
Einar, tonight,
you play on the house.

482
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,452
This is marvelous, eh?

483
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,206
Enjoy, my friend. Enjoy.

484
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,792
To Ghostwood.

485
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,879
To Ghostwood Estates
and Country Club.

486
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,887
Congratulations, boss.

487
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,059
Blackie, old pal,

488
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,479
this calls for a celebration.

489
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:32,900
Let's have a look at the new girl.

490
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,121
Good luck, honey.

491
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,542
Close your eyes.

492
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:55,423
This is such stuff
as dreams are made of.

493
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,098
Diane.

494
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,517
4:37 a.m.

495
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,353
After a long investigative night,

496
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,480
returning to my room
at The Great Northern.

497
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,981
We have one suspect in custody

498
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,276
and Leo Johnson, the man I believe
is responsible for Laura's death,

499
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:19,572
won't be able to escape the dragnet
we've thrown up for him much longer.

500
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,745
As you can hear
from the ambient sound around me,

501
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,373
and I notice with some relief
that the Icelandic group

502
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:33,586
staying on my floor
have either checked or passed out.

503
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,256
I may not need
the Ear-Pillow Earplugs,

504
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,092
which I did receive today, Diane,

505
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,802
although I suspect
I may put them to use

506
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,846
as a purely precautionary measure.

507
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,932
I ordered some hot milk
from room service.

508
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,183
Hoping that does the job

509
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,853
and I'll be able to catch a few hours
of quality sack time.

510
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,980
Twenty-four hour room service

511
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:56,943
must be one of the premier
achievements of modern civilization.

512
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,913
"My special agent."

513
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,511
Cooper here.

514
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,181
Who is this?

515
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,394
Couldn't this wait
until tomorrow morning?

516
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:35,314
Please excuse me,
I've got room service.

517
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,945
Agent Cooper,
we found Leo Johnson.

518
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,489
He's been shot. Agent Cooper?
