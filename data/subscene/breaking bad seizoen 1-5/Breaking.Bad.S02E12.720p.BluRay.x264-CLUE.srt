1
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,967
Skyler, I'm so...

2
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:41,971
Marie. Oh, Christ, Marie. How...?

3
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:46,725
Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

4
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:49,186
Is she beautiful?

5
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:56,986
Yeah, I'm staring at brake lights
on the 40.

6
00:00:57,194 --> 00:00:58,779
Some accident up ahead.

7
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,907
Christ! Today of all days, huh?

8
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:07,079
No, no, no. Let her rest.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

9
00:01:08,122 --> 00:01:09,164
Thank you.

10
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,015
Excuse me. Skyler White?

11
00:01:26,223 --> 00:01:28,684
- 307.
- Thank you.

12
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:42,489
Skyler, I'm so sorry. I'm just...

13
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:44,366
Are you okay?

14
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:49,872
Meet your daughter.

15
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:04,386
Hi there, girl. Hi there, Holly.

16
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:06,555
Congratulations, Walt.

17
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:12,561
Oh, Ted, I'm sorry,
I didn't see you here.

18
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,356
Oh, Ted drove me here. Thank God.

19
00:02:15,564 --> 00:02:20,110
I mean, this little bundle of joy
of ours was practically on rails.

20
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,863
Halfway here I thought
he was gonna have to pull over...

21
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:24,907
...and deliver her himself.

22
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:31,080
Well, that--
I'm glad it didn't come to that.

23
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:33,165
Yeah. Thanks, Ted.

24
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:35,709
No problem at all.

25
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:38,712
Well, let me get out of your way here
so you two can--

26
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:41,882
You three can be alone, okay?

27
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,718
Listen, take it easy, Sky.

28
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:48,597
- I really can't begin to thank you.
- Don't think anything of it.

29
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:50,766
It's my pleasure.
Congratulations again.

30
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:52,393
- Thank you.
- She's beautiful.

31
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,103
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

32
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:55,604
Okay. Take care.

33
00:02:55,813 --> 00:02:57,064
Bye.

34
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:08,117
Are you okay?

35
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:10,160
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is okay.

36
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:13,789
I just wish you'd been here.

37
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:19,962
- Where's everyone else?
- Downstairs.

38
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,839
Hank and Marie
took Junior for dinner.

39
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:26,260
He has been such a trouper.
He even changed his first diaper.

40
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:28,387
- No.
- Yeah.

41
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:31,974
Did he?

42
00:03:34,476 --> 00:03:36,895
Honey, is there anything
that I can do for you?

43
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:39,440
- Anything at all?
- Actually, yes.

44
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,234
I left my overnight bag
at home this morning.

45
00:03:42,443 --> 00:03:45,154
I just think you get it in your head,
C-section. You know?

46
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:49,158
But I'm just so glad,
the way it all worked out.

47
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:51,702
Doing it natural instead.

48
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,163
It just couldn't have gone any better.

49
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:55,873
Good.

50
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:03,339
Let me go get your things.

51
00:04:04,214 --> 00:04:07,927
And I'll get my stuff too, okay?

52
00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:09,678
- I'll spend the night.
- Okay.

53
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:46,025
Dad.

54
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,861
I was in the shower, hey.

55
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:51,947
I overslept.

56
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,909
I'm running late, but I'll be there.

57
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,661
Yeah.

58
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,044
Baby, I gotta go.

59
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:08,547
Okay.

60
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:24,897
Somebody broke in.

61
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:26,690
Okay.

62
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:45,668
Oh, no. No, no, no!

63
00:06:46,627 --> 00:06:48,212
Come on.

64
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:50,297
Damn.

65
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,718
Oh, God.

66
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:58,013
Oh, Christ.

67
00:07:02,977 --> 00:07:04,311
This week was tough.

68
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,938
Toughest yet.

69
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:09,316
You know why?
I knew this day was coming.

70
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:11,902
- My birthday.
- Your re-birthday?

71
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:14,113
Yeah. As it got closer, it got worse.

72
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:16,156
I was scared shitless
I wouldn't make it.

73
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:17,783
I really didn't think I would.

74
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:20,327
Called in sick three days in a row.

75
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:22,496
I know my boss was pissed.

76
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:25,708
I guess I don't really care.
I just didn't wanna see anybody.

77
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,042
You guys know how that is.

78
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:29,169
All it would take is one friend...

79
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:32,047
...and I'd be out
ripping and running again.

80
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:34,383
But I made it. I really made it.

81
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:37,553
I got one year clean to the day.

82
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:02,244
You look tired.
Your eyes are kind of red.

83
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:05,539
- You getting enough sleep?
- Actually, no.

84
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:09,251
I'm working on this
really complex new tat.

85
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,920
- Yeah?
- A guy wants his whole back done up.

86
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,715
Him on his chopper with, like,
flames all around.

87
00:08:14,923 --> 00:08:18,385
I keep showing him the design,
he keeps asking for changes, like:

88
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:20,596
"Give me more muscles.
Give me more flames."

89
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:23,766
And I'm like, "A:
This ain't the Sistine Chapel.

90
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:28,187
And B: I have enough trouble
working around your zits."

91
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,856
I really wish you wouldn't
work at that place.

92
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:32,942
You need to avoid
those type of people.

93
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,111
I know and I do.

94
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:40,574
It's mostly college kids
and airmen from Kirtland.

95
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:42,618
It's actually really corporate.

96
00:08:44,286 --> 00:08:45,704
Thank you.

97
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:52,544
So how's your job?

98
00:08:52,753 --> 00:08:54,630
Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

99
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:57,132
Doing backup training
on my days off.

100
00:08:57,341 --> 00:09:01,136
God, they're hiring anybody now.
I mean, no experience at all. It's scary.

101
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:08,727
You seeing anyone?

102
00:09:10,938 --> 00:09:12,398
No.

103
00:09:12,731 --> 00:09:13,774
You?

104
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:16,568
What about that guy next door?

105
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:18,112
What do you mean?

106
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,656
Well, he seemed to have
some expectation...

107
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:22,449
...of you introducing me to him.

108
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:24,743
He knows you own the place.

109
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,578
Yeah.

110
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:28,122
Dad, he's our tenant.

111
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:30,165
End of story.

112
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:32,293
Why would I get involved
with a tenant?

113
00:09:34,378 --> 00:09:35,421
Okay.

114
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:38,173
There you go.

115
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,518
Oh, yes.

116
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:51,812
Oh, isn't she beautiful?

117
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:54,523
I just think she's the most
beautiful baby ever.

118
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:57,109
Yeah. And why not?

119
00:09:57,318 --> 00:09:59,069
Good stock.

120
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:03,532
I'll get it.

121
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:05,034
Yeah. Yeah.

122
00:10:05,242 --> 00:10:08,037
Hello. Hello?

123
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:11,415
Nobody's there.

124
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:13,208
Oh, well.

125
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:17,004
Beat you.

126
00:10:17,838 --> 00:10:19,548
- Hello.
- Hey, man.

127
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:21,216
<i>Oh, hi, Carmen.</i>

128
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,968
Just Carmen.

129
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:26,805
- Come on. Hurry up.
- So you heard, huh? Yes, yes.

130
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:29,391
<i>Good news.
Oh, she's just so beautiful.</i>

131
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:31,977
Well, Holly.

132
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:34,021
<i>Seven pounds, 3 ounces.</i>

133
00:10:34,229 --> 00:10:36,774
Everybody is doing just fine.

134
00:10:36,982 --> 00:10:39,735
You junkie imbecile.
What are you calling this number for?

135
00:10:39,944 --> 00:10:42,071
I am trying to tell you, man.

136
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:45,199
Last night,
somebody broke in my place, yo.

137
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:46,867
<i>- I got robbed.
- What?</i>

138
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:51,580
Yeah. Somebody,
they got all of our stuff. Okay?

139
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:53,499
All of it.

140
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:57,711
You get me, Mr. White?

141
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,005
<i>The blue stuff. It's, like, uncanny.</i>

142
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:02,424
They knew exactly where to look.

143
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:06,262
I mean, say something, man, all right?
Yell at me or something! Come on!

144
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:08,764
<i>Mr. White.</i>

145
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,393
God!

146
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,062
Oh, no.

147
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:21,277
Okay. Okay. Okay.

148
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:30,577
Hank, come on.
People are starving to death out here.

149
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:32,830
All right. I just had to get a beer.

150
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:34,581
Finally.

151
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,375
All right, guys. Here we go.

152
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:40,379
<i>We got mild, medium
and muy caliente.</i>

153
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:42,798
I got dibs on the breast.

154
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:46,135
- Los Polios Hermanos?
- Oh, yeah, seriously. You gotta try it.

155
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:49,638
I think this joint gives KFC
a run for their money.

156
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:51,890
That baby is hungry.

157
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:53,475
Give me that baby.

158
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:55,811
Oh, sweetie, yes.

159
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,646
Do you have any coleslaw in there?

160
00:11:57,855 --> 00:11:59,481
Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Jeez, Sky.

161
00:12:00,524 --> 00:12:03,986
- Not at the table. We're eating.
- Hank, it's only a breast.

162
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:07,281
- It's my sister-in-law's breast.
- Oh, you are so provincial.

163
00:12:08,157 --> 00:12:09,908
Hank, remember the day...

164
00:12:10,117 --> 00:12:12,411
...when you were talking to me
about childproofing?

165
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,662
Yeah.

166
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:16,332
Yeah, yeah. What are you thinking?
A fence or a cover?

167
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,294
Yeah. No, well, actually, I was
thinking more of an alarm system.

168
00:12:20,502 --> 00:12:24,465
They've got these new systems that
are now sonar systems that would--

169
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:26,884
Anything falls into it,
it sets the alarm off.

170
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:28,093
Oh, nice.

171
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:31,138
- Wow, that sounds expensive.
- Well, yeah.

172
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:36,018
- But for the baby, I mean...
- Well, why don't...

173
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:39,188
Why don't you let Marie and I
get that for you?

174
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:41,815
- Absolutely.
- No, no. Thank you.

175
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:44,526
No, no, please.
I'll be back at work soon.

176
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:46,403
We'll take care of it.

177
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:48,489
Back at work soon?

178
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:51,241
Since you're scheduled
for surgery...

179
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:55,704
...I just thought it might be a good
idea to have some money coming in.

180
00:12:57,331 --> 00:13:02,419
Well, Skyler, we need to think
about what's best for the baby.

181
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:06,715
And I think having her mother around
for at least the first few years...

182
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:11,971
Money-wise, we'll manage.
I promise you that.

183
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:15,808
What? You guys got, like, a printing
press in the garage churning out 50s?

184
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:17,059
I wish.

185
00:13:17,268 --> 00:13:19,270
Mom's even talking
about me getting a job.

186
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:23,065
That's right. Everybody pitches in.

187
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:26,527
Why don't we ever get Chinese?

188
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:35,828
I'll get her.

189
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:38,080
I'll get her.

190
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:49,925
Yes. Good girl.

191
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:52,469
That's a good girl.

192
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:54,930
My little girl, huh?

193
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:10,362
Hey, do you wanna see something?

194
00:14:11,655 --> 00:14:13,240
Come here.

195
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:16,243
Oh, I know, I know.

196
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:22,291
Yeah.

197
00:14:28,923 --> 00:14:30,466
Hey.

198
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:34,303
You wanna see what
your daddy did for you?

199
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,307
Let me show you.

200
00:14:39,224 --> 00:14:41,352
Here. Come here.

201
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:45,439
Wanna see?

202
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:02,706
That's right. Daddy did that.

203
00:15:08,712 --> 00:15:11,048
Daddy did that for you.

204
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:25,020
This place looks exactly the same.

205
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:28,565
Why don't you have computers
and shit? It's the 20th century.

206
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:30,276
What the hell are you doing here?

207
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,486
- Get out.
- No. You took the stash.

208
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:34,655
I heard all those messages,
figured it out.

209
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:37,825
You figured it out, huh?
Well, congratulations, Einstein.

210
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:41,787
You left me to freak out all day long
like I dropped the ball or something...

211
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:45,541
- ...and you were the one who took it!
- Shut up.

212
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,377
You lower your voice.

213
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,217
"Like you dropped the ball"?

214
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:59,179
When have you ever
not dropped the ball, Jesse?

215
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:01,890
Blasted out of your mind
on whatever the hell that was.

216
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:05,311
What was that, heroin?

217
00:16:07,271 --> 00:16:08,355
Jesus.

218
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:11,233
I was on my day off, man.
What I do on my day off--

219
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:13,736
"Day off"?
We were on call, you junkie.

220
00:16:13,944 --> 00:16:16,030
On call for the biggest deal
of our lives.

221
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:19,617
I just managed to pull it off by the
skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.

222
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:23,912
And you made me miss
the birth of my daughter.

223
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,625
Son of a bitch.

224
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:31,837
How much?

225
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,800
- How much what?
- How much did you get for the deal?

226
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:42,389
One-point-two million.

227
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,017
Six hundred thousand each.

228
00:16:45,225 --> 00:16:47,019
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

229
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:49,772
Saul's cut is 20 percent.

230
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:53,651
All right.
So where's my money?

231
00:16:54,944 --> 00:16:56,362
What?

232
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:00,449
You are joking, right?

233
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:04,536
If I gave you that money...

234
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:06,914
...you would be dead
inside of a week.

235
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:11,710
Man, look, I'm off the heroin.

236
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,297
I didn't even like it anyway.
It made me sick.

237
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:17,424
And the... And the meth.

238
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:20,970
You know, I could take it or leave it.

239
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:23,764
I'm clean, Mr. White.

240
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:25,557
For real.

241
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:39,989
Prove it. Pee in that.

242
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:43,033
- How gay are you, seriously?
- Pee in it.

243
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:45,577
They're selling testing kits
at the drugstores.

244
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:49,123
If you are clean,
I will give you every last dime.

245
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:51,625
No, huh?

246
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,337
Well, I guess, until then
you'll just have to depend...

247
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:58,507
...on the kindness of strangers
to get high.

248
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:01,510
That and your little junkie girlfriend.

249
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:30,873
Not on her tummy, Walt.

250
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:33,834
I'm not putting her on her tummy.

251
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:36,670
I'll put her on her side.
Do you wanna hold her back?

252
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,631
- Yeah.
- Right there.

253
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:41,342
Just in case she decides
to do a little spit-up...

254
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,305
...I'm gonna roll up a nice clean towel
like this and put it under.

255
00:18:47,264 --> 00:18:49,600
Hammacher Schlemmer
makes a proper one of those.

256
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:52,227
- It's hypoallergenic.
- Oh, yeah?

257
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:54,730
Well, I think a towel will do.

258
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:00,319
Skyler, what is it?

259
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:05,574
Your son. He is just unbelievable.
Come see what he did.

260
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:15,000
- I told you it's not ready yet.
- Honey, just show it to them.

261
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:36,981
My God, son. That's wonderful.

262
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:38,607
Flynn.

263
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:41,193
This is beautiful.

264
00:19:41,902 --> 00:19:44,780
SaveWalterWhite.com.

265
00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:48,200
Well, I, for one,
am telling everybody.

266
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:53,706
Wait a minute. You're not asking
for money, are you, son?

267
00:19:53,914 --> 00:19:55,874
Yeah. That's the whole idea.

268
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:59,211
Louis helped me set up
a PayPal account and everything.

269
00:20:00,004 --> 00:20:03,215
- See?
- But we can't ask for money.

270
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:06,343
Walt.

271
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:09,513
Okay.

272
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:13,767
I appreciate it. I really do.

273
00:20:14,351 --> 00:20:16,478
Show me what else you put on.

274
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:22,610
This was all his idea.
He worked so hard on it.

275
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:24,820
- Just let him help.
- Skyler.

276
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:28,907
It's-- You can't ask him
to take it down.

277
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:33,037
- It'll crush him.
- Skyler, it's charity.

278
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:40,336
Why do you say that
like it's some sort of dirty word?

279
00:20:50,137 --> 00:20:52,014
This is insane.

280
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:54,350
I have so much cash on hand...

281
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,436
...that I actually count it
by weighing it on my bathroom scale.

282
00:20:57,645 --> 00:21:01,023
And yet, I can't spend it.
I can't tell my family about it.

283
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:04,068
All of whom think that I am
right on the edge of bankruptcy.

284
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:05,778
I mean, it's--

285
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,613
It's insane.

286
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:10,866
Well, I guess that's why
gangsters had molls.

287
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:12,660
What?

288
00:21:13,077 --> 00:21:14,370
Gun molls.

289
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:16,538
<i>Haven't you ever seen White Heat?</i>

290
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:19,208
<i>Yeah, I've seen White Heat...</i>

291
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:22,336
- ...but I don't see how that pertains.
- Maybe you need a moll...

292
00:21:22,544 --> 00:21:25,214
...more than a wife
who you can't trust with your secrets.

293
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:26,966
- Just--
- What good is money...

294
00:21:27,174 --> 00:21:29,718
...that doesn't spend?
The tree falls in the forest...

295
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:33,472
You know, you get the point.
So communicating is out?

296
00:21:34,765 --> 00:21:36,058
Out.

297
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:37,643
Let's see. What else is there?

298
00:21:37,851 --> 00:21:40,145
There's always,
"Hey, I found a big bag of money...

299
00:21:40,354 --> 00:21:42,106
...down by the rail road tracks."

300
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:44,858
No? No? Works for me.

301
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:46,860
Uncle Murray.

302
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:49,154
Oh, yeah.

303
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:51,865
Yeah,
"Oh, many is the happy memory...

304
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:53,993
...of Uncle Murray
bouncing me on his knee.

305
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:56,870
We lost track of
the old pervert years ago...

306
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:00,291
- ...but he kicked it, left me millions."
- No, no.

307
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:05,754
It cannot be blind luck or some
imaginary relative who saves us.

308
00:22:05,963 --> 00:22:08,507
No, I earned that money, me.

309
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,218
And now my son created
his own website...

310
00:22:11,427 --> 00:22:15,431
...SaveWalterWhite.com,
soliciting anonymous donations.

311
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:19,310
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

312
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:26,609
Yeah, look at that.
It's got PayPal and everything.

313
00:22:26,817 --> 00:22:30,112
Cyber-begging. That's all that is.

314
00:22:30,321 --> 00:22:33,449
Just rattling a little tin cup
to the entire world.

315
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:36,243
Yeah, there's no deep-seated
issues there.

316
00:22:36,452 --> 00:22:39,622
Walter, I'm looking at the answer here.
It's staring me in the face.

317
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,625
- Do I have to spell it out for you?
- I know. I know.

318
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,127
You're thinking that I should be
funnelling money...

319
00:22:45,336 --> 00:22:47,463
...into my son's website,
but absolutely not.

320
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:50,299
I am not going to have
my family think that some...

321
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:52,676
...mystery benefactor saved us.

322
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:55,846
Not some mystery benefactor,
singular.

323
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:58,390
That would raise too many questions.
However--

324
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,643
Stay with me here.

325
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:02,394
--zombies.

326
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:07,399
<i>I got a guy, who knows this guy,
who knows this Rain Man-type.</i>

327
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:10,986
He lives with his mother
in her basement in Belarus, all right?

328
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:14,114
So good luck extraditing
his fat Russian ass.

329
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:17,743
Wait. He's a hacker-cracker
extraordinaire.

330
00:23:17,952 --> 00:23:20,579
This guy can hijack
random desktops...

331
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:24,458
...all around the world, turn them
into zombies that do his bidding.

332
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:29,129
For instance, he can make it
so 20- or 30,000...

333
00:23:29,338 --> 00:23:32,675
...little donations come in
from all over the U.S. and Canada.

334
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:34,927
Ten, 20, 50 bucks a pop...

335
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:38,389
...all paid in full, nice and neat,
untraceable...

336
00:23:38,597 --> 00:23:42,518
...from the good-hearted people
of the world to Mr. Walter H. White...

337
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:44,853
...cancer saint.

338
00:23:45,062 --> 00:23:48,732
I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling
just thinking about it.

339
00:23:52,236 --> 00:23:57,199
He's an asshole, that's what.
Always judging me.

340
00:23:58,242 --> 00:23:59,702
Not too much.

341
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,371
I mean, like, who is he, right?

342
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:05,291
I mean, first off, I taught him.

343
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:08,544
Always acting like
I'm his indentured servant.

344
00:24:19,346 --> 00:24:21,140
Now the cotton.

345
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:28,063
Needle?

346
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,402
- I don't understand why you need him.
- Exactly.

347
00:24:34,737 --> 00:24:38,240
My point exactly.

348
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:50,753
Flat against your skin
so it doesn't wiggle around too much.

349
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:57,718
How much does he owe you,
anyway?

350
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:01,430
Four hundred and eighty.

351
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,975
Oh, hell, I'd be mad too
if somebody owed me 500 bucks.

352
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:07,394
No, no.

353
00:25:08,145 --> 00:25:09,939
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

354
00:25:11,774 --> 00:25:12,942
What?

355
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:16,445
What?

356
00:25:16,946 --> 00:25:18,697
Thousand.

357
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:22,618
Not on your back,
in case you throw up.

358
00:25:22,826 --> 00:25:26,121
On your side. Sleep on your side.

359
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,549
And she's all like:

360
00:25:37,758 --> 00:25:41,303
"Don't preach to me." And I'm like,
"Baby, I'm not preaching to you.

361
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:44,181
I'm talking about basic survival,
you know?

362
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,226
I'm conversing
about life and death."

363
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:50,145
I mean, this here,
what we've been doing...

364
00:25:50,354 --> 00:25:52,398
...hell, Becky knows.

365
00:25:58,195 --> 00:25:59,613
Dad?

366
00:25:59,822 --> 00:26:01,991
I overslept. I'm on my way.

367
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,840
Dad?

368
00:26:19,675 --> 00:26:20,843
Dad, wait.

369
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:23,512
Dad, it's not what it looks like.

370
00:26:24,305 --> 00:26:25,848
Dad.

371
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,394
Dad, will just wait? Let me--
Just talk to you for one second.

372
00:26:30,603 --> 00:26:31,687
No, Dad.

373
00:26:31,895 --> 00:26:34,189
Dad, come on.

374
00:26:37,818 --> 00:26:39,194
Dad?

375
00:26:40,696 --> 00:26:43,699
Dad, no. No, stop it!
Don't touch him, Dad!

376
00:26:43,907 --> 00:26:46,243
- Dad, stop. Dad, let him go!
- Son of a bitch.

377
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:51,040
Dad, no. Stop it!
Stop it, Dad! Stop it!

378
00:26:51,248 --> 00:26:54,084
- Get away from me, man. Back off.
- Jesse.

379
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:55,336
- Jesse, no!
- Back off!

380
00:26:55,544 --> 00:26:58,255
- Okay, everybody just calm down!
- What's with you, yo?

381
00:26:58,464 --> 00:27:01,759
- Because I'll seriously bust you up.
- You miserable little smackhead.

382
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:04,053
- Get the hell out!
- Hey, I pay my rent, bitch!

383
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:05,721
All right? I got civil rights.

384
00:27:06,263 --> 00:27:07,681
Dad, no! Okay!

385
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,392
Jesse, come on.
Please, no. Come on.

386
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:13,395
I pay my rent.

387
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:17,566
You're going back to rehab.
Today. Now.

388
00:27:17,775 --> 00:27:20,152
Look, as it so happens,
we were just...

389
00:27:20,361 --> 00:27:21,987
We were just talking
about that now.

390
00:27:22,196 --> 00:27:24,406
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I was gonna tell you, okay?

391
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:27,076
- If you would just let me.
- Eighteen months.

392
00:27:27,284 --> 00:27:30,704
You have been clean for 18 months,
Jane. Why? Why do you do it?

393
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:34,083
I backslid, okay?

394
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,043
Like, what?

395
00:27:36,252 --> 00:27:38,254
What, you think I'm proud of this?

396
00:27:38,462 --> 00:27:40,297
Like I do it on purpose?

397
00:27:40,506 --> 00:27:41,924
Lying to me...

398
00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:45,094
...shacking up and using
with this scumbag, this loser.

399
00:27:45,302 --> 00:27:46,470
It takes one to know one.

400
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:49,598
His name is Jesse. You don't know
the first thing about him.

401
00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:52,434
We talk about rehab every night.
It's his idea.

402
00:27:52,643 --> 00:27:55,521
You talk about rehab?
Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?

403
00:27:56,313 --> 00:28:00,609
Thank you for not being judgemental
24 hours a day.

404
00:28:00,818 --> 00:28:04,697
Because that's exactly what I need,
to be judged all the time!

405
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,783
Okay.

406
00:28:07,992 --> 00:28:10,327
You know what you need?
I'll tell you what you need.

407
00:28:10,536 --> 00:28:11,578
What are you doing?

408
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:14,415
- What are you doing?
- I am calling the police.

409
00:28:15,124 --> 00:28:18,419
- Dad. Dad, no, don't.
- Come on. Come on!

410
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:20,671
- Dad, no. Don't.
- I have tried 10 years...

411
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:22,381
...of love and understanding.

412
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,718
Maybe what it takes
is you drying out in a jail cell.

413
00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:27,303
Dad, no.

414
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:30,889
Yes, I would like to report drug use
in a building that I own.

415
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:34,351
- Dad. Daddy, no.
- No. It's ongoing. It's illegal activity.

416
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,312
- I'd like to talk to somebody.
- Daddy.

417
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,148
- Would you connect me, please?
- Fine, we'll go to rehab.

418
00:28:39,356 --> 00:28:41,400
I could care less
about him going to rehab.

419
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:44,028
- I want you in rehab.
- I'll go first thing tomorrow.

420
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:45,946
Not tomorrow. Today.

421
00:28:46,155 --> 00:28:49,408
I have to call into work.
I have to stop the newspaper.

422
00:28:49,617 --> 00:28:53,579
The last time I went, my houseplants
died because you didn't water them.

423
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,168
Daddy, please?

424
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,586
I'll go.

425
00:29:00,794 --> 00:29:03,339
<i>Albuquerque Police.
How may I direct your call?</i>

426
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:05,841
Tomorrow.

427
00:29:06,383 --> 00:29:07,718
<i>Hello?</i>

428
00:29:10,054 --> 00:29:11,555
<i>Hello?</i>

429
00:29:12,056 --> 00:29:13,515
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

430
00:29:19,063 --> 00:29:20,189
Tomorrow.

431
00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:40,542
You meant all that?

432
00:29:42,336 --> 00:29:43,921
I don't know.

433
00:29:44,922 --> 00:29:47,549
I just think
if we had enough money...

434
00:29:48,342 --> 00:29:51,053
...nobody could make us
do anything.

435
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,917
Oh, just let it ring.

436
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:24,587
No, I'm gonna go see who it is.

437
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:28,507
It's okay, Holly.

438
00:30:28,882 --> 00:30:30,926
It's okay, sweetie.

439
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:32,845
Good luck with that.

440
00:30:33,053 --> 00:30:36,599
But I'm sure he'd be glad to,
you know, write some--

441
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:41,520
You know, actually, here he is
right now. So hold on a second.

442
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:43,856
- What?
- It's one of your...

443
00:30:44,064 --> 00:30:48,068
One of your old students
wants a letter of recommendation.

444
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:51,614
Oh, okay. Thanks.

445
00:30:51,822 --> 00:30:54,950
Oh, honey,
I think the baby is getting hungry.

446
00:30:56,118 --> 00:30:59,371
<i>- This is Walter White.
- Hello, Walter White.</i>

447
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:05,961
I'm sorry.
I'm having a little trouble recalling--

448
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,671
It's Jane.

449
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,798
You know, of Jesse and Jane.

450
00:31:10,007 --> 00:31:11,258
<i>Jesse's "junkie girlfriend."</i>

451
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:16,513
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.
It really has been a long time.

452
00:31:16,722 --> 00:31:18,265
Get somewhere
where you can talk.

453
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:23,145
Sure. Yes.
I am looking into that as we speak.

454
00:31:25,898 --> 00:31:29,151
How the hell did you get this number?
Did Jesse give it to you?

455
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,112
All Jesse wants
is what's coming to him.

456
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:33,822
No more, no less.

457
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:35,491
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

458
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:37,326
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

459
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:45,125
<i>- He told you about the money.
- He told me everything.</i>

460
00:31:49,338 --> 00:31:52,341
So, what is this?

461
00:31:54,051 --> 00:31:56,178
What, some kind of blackmail
or something?

462
00:31:56,387 --> 00:31:58,347
This is me telling you
to do right by Jesse.

463
00:31:58,555 --> 00:32:00,015
Bring him what you owe him.

464
00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:01,642
<i>I don't call that blackmail.</i>

465
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,020
<i>I call that you getting off your ass,
and being a decent human being.</i>

466
00:32:05,229 --> 00:32:06,772
Well, I call it blackmail.

467
00:32:06,981 --> 00:32:10,734
Dialling my number.
Talking to my wife.

468
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,987
And what's your end of this?

469
00:32:13,195 --> 00:32:16,532
How much heroin
does a half a million dollars buy?

470
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:20,703
For your information,
I am holding Jesse's money for him...

471
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:23,038
<i>...and he will receive
every last dollar of it.</i>

472
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:24,707
He will, not you...

473
00:32:24,915 --> 00:32:26,542
...at a time when I see fit.

474
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,211
But I will not contribute
to his overdose.

475
00:32:29,795 --> 00:32:32,131
<i>Now you tell him, if he gets clean--</i>

476
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:34,341
<i>- If you both get clean--
- You know what?</i>

477
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,218
I take that back. This is blackmail.

478
00:32:36,427 --> 00:32:38,804
Because what I know about you,
high-school teacher...

479
00:32:39,013 --> 00:32:41,640
<i>...turned drug dealer,
with a brother-in-law in the DEA...</i>

480
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:45,060
<i>...that would make one hell of a story.
National news, I'll bet.</i>

481
00:32:45,978 --> 00:32:51,025
Do right by Jesse tonight
or I will burn you to the ground.

482
00:32:59,074 --> 00:33:00,117
Shit.

483
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:06,749
He's a high-school teacher. What's
he gonna do, give you a B-minus?

484
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:09,585
Send you outside
to clap the erasers?

485
00:33:11,128 --> 00:33:15,549
You wouldn't really go to the cops,
would you?

486
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:17,927
We won't have to. He'll pay.

487
00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:20,512
And what if he doesn't?

488
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:22,598
Jesse, it's your money.

489
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:27,269
You're in the right here. He's in
the wrong. He's not stupid. He'll pay.

490
00:33:31,815 --> 00:33:33,609
What is it, really?

491
00:33:33,817 --> 00:33:36,195
You don't want
your half a million dollars?

492
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:39,949
You wanna renounce your earthly
possessions and become a monk?

493
00:33:41,992 --> 00:33:45,663
No, it's just,
I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.

494
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:49,124
And by extension, you know,
neither are you.

495
00:33:54,797 --> 00:33:57,132
I mean, he's my partner.

496
00:34:00,344 --> 00:34:02,096
I'm your partner.

497
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:12,481
<i>The largest land animal
in all the planet...</i>

498
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,359
<i>...lives in a tightly knit
matriarchal society...</i>

499
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:17,653
<i>...led by the eldest female
in the herd.</i>

500
00:34:19,613 --> 00:34:22,658
<i>Close your eyes and go to sleep.</i>

501
00:35:15,044 --> 00:35:18,964
She is finally asleep.

502
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:26,555
What you doing,
learning about elephants?

503
00:35:37,274 --> 00:35:41,570
Oh, honey, we're out of diapers.
Would you mind going out?

504
00:36:18,983 --> 00:36:20,401
Jesse.

505
00:36:21,026 --> 00:36:22,611
Not you.

506
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,586
Nice job wearing the pants.

507
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:47,970
How do I know she'll keep quiet?

508
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,556
I guess you don't.

509
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,103
You'll never hear
from either of us again.

510
00:36:59,273 --> 00:37:02,109
You're not seeing straight, Jesse.

511
00:37:02,693 --> 00:37:04,278
You are making a mistake.

512
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:23,005
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a whole lot of cheddar.

513
00:37:23,213 --> 00:37:24,798
This is freedom.

514
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:27,843
This is saying,
"I can go anywhere I want.

515
00:37:28,052 --> 00:37:30,346
I can be anybody."

516
00:37:30,638 --> 00:37:32,014
Who do you wanna be?

517
00:37:32,222 --> 00:37:35,351
Where do you wanna go?
South America? Europe? Australia?

518
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:38,854
- Is New Zealand part of Australia?
- New Zealand is New Zealand.

519
00:37:39,063 --> 00:37:40,147
Right on.

520
00:37:40,356 --> 00:37:43,525
<i>New Zealand. That's where
they made Lord of the Rings.</i>

521
00:37:43,734 --> 00:37:46,612
I say we just move there, yo.
I mean, you can do your art.

522
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,573
Right? Like, you can paint, like,
the local castles and shit.

523
00:37:49,782 --> 00:37:51,867
And I can be a bush pilot.

524
00:37:52,076 --> 00:37:54,662
Yeah. New Zealand.
I can get behind that.

525
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:58,958
But I guess I'm good anywhere
as long as it's the two of us.

526
00:38:06,215 --> 00:38:07,883
But first, we gotta get clean.

527
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:10,052
And not because
anybody is telling us to.

528
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:15,182
- We do this for us, right?
- Yeah. Absolutely. For us.

529
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:18,352
All this here, we're not gonna
just shoot this up our arms, Jesse.

530
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,603
We're not.

531
00:38:19,812 --> 00:38:22,314
Hell, no. No, no, no.
We're better than that.

532
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:25,150
We're way better than that. I say...

533
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,196
I say we flush what we've got left
and we start tonight.

534
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,618
Yeah, we can do that.

535
00:38:35,202 --> 00:38:36,912
Definitely.

536
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:42,918
Excuse me.

537
00:38:51,552 --> 00:38:53,262
What can I get you?

538
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,474
Give me a Fat Tire draught, please.

539
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:05,232
Damn it.

540
00:39:08,027 --> 00:39:09,778
Hey, honey.

541
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:12,656
No. I don't know what to tell you.

542
00:39:12,865 --> 00:39:17,161
Three stores I've been to so far,
and not one of them have it in stock.

543
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:21,081
Well, do they have
to be diapers for newborns?

544
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,168
What if we went up a size
and just kind of...

545
00:39:25,002 --> 00:39:27,004
All right, all right. No, I understand.

546
00:39:27,212 --> 00:39:30,215
All right. No, I'll just keep looking.

547
00:39:30,424 --> 00:39:34,094
I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so...

548
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:37,056
Yeah. Okay. Love you.

549
00:39:37,264 --> 00:39:38,891
Thank you.

550
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:41,143
God.

551
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,355
Well played.

552
00:39:54,156 --> 00:39:56,241
They found water on Mars.

553
00:39:57,576 --> 00:39:58,661
They have indeed.

554
00:39:59,244 --> 00:40:01,330
Don't know what to do
with that information...

555
00:40:01,538 --> 00:40:03,999
...but, hey, God bless them,
they found it.

556
00:40:06,085 --> 00:40:08,462
Oh, well, actually...

557
00:40:08,671 --> 00:40:13,384
...they theoretically can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen...

558
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:17,805
...and process that into providing
fuel for manned space flights.

559
00:40:18,013 --> 00:40:22,351
Ostensibly, turning Mars into
a giant gas station.

560
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:24,353
So it's a...

561
00:40:25,271 --> 00:40:29,191
Yeah. We live in an amazing time.

562
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:34,321
- To water on Mars.
- To water on Mars.

563
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:40,494
So, what did you have? Girl or boy?

564
00:40:41,912 --> 00:40:44,039
- Little girl.
- That's nice.

565
00:40:44,248 --> 00:40:45,457
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.

566
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:46,709
Thank you.

567
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:49,378
- I have a daughter.
- Yeah?

568
00:40:49,628 --> 00:40:51,213
How old?

569
00:40:51,422 --> 00:40:52,881
Old enough to know better.

570
00:40:53,632 --> 00:40:55,718
Twenty-seven next month.

571
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,515
- You have other kids?
- Just the one.

572
00:41:02,975 --> 00:41:07,187
I've got a 16-year-old boy.
Well, he's almost 16.

573
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:11,525
Jeez. Oh, there's a spread, huh?

574
00:41:12,276 --> 00:41:14,111
But he helps out, though.

575
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,197
He's even changing some diapers
now, so...

576
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:20,618
It's more than I managed to do
when I was his age.

577
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:24,413
Kids today grow up faster, I think.

578
00:41:24,955 --> 00:41:27,875
Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe so.

579
00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:31,462
So, any advice?

580
00:41:32,212 --> 00:41:35,299
Having a daughter. Any advice?

581
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:39,094
No, not really. Just love them.

582
00:41:39,303 --> 00:41:40,930
Just-- Yeah.

583
00:41:41,138 --> 00:41:44,683
I mean, they are who they are.

584
00:41:46,435 --> 00:41:47,937
Yeah.

585
00:41:49,021 --> 00:41:53,233
I've got this nephew.

586
00:41:56,111 --> 00:41:59,531
This nephew who is--
I mean, he's an adult.

587
00:42:00,783 --> 00:42:06,080
But you can't infantilize them,
you can't live their life for them.

588
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:10,167
But still, I mean,
there is that frustration.

589
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:11,877
You know, that...

590
00:42:12,086 --> 00:42:15,464
God, that frustration
that goes along with, you know:

591
00:42:15,673 --> 00:42:19,718
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know
what is best for you, so listen."

592
00:42:21,929 --> 00:42:24,014
But of course, they don't.

593
00:42:26,225 --> 00:42:28,811
I mean, what do you do
with someone like that?

594
00:42:29,478 --> 00:42:30,896
Family?

595
00:42:33,857 --> 00:42:37,278
Yeah. Family.

596
00:42:37,987 --> 00:42:40,489
You can't give up on them. Never.

597
00:42:40,698 --> 00:42:43,742
I mean, what else is there?

598
00:43:29,872 --> 00:43:32,583
Jesse, it's me.

599
00:43:38,422 --> 00:43:41,842
Jesse, I just wanna talk.

600
00:44:19,421 --> 00:44:21,298
Jesus.

601
00:44:37,648 --> 00:44:39,191
Jesse.

602
00:44:44,321 --> 00:44:45,781
Jesse.

603
00:44:47,825 --> 00:44:50,077
Jesse, wake up.

604
00:44:50,286 --> 00:44:52,913
Jesse, wake up.

605
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:23,652
No, no, no.
