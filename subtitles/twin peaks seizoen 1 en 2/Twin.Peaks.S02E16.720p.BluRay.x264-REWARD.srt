1
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,432
Now, Dale, listen carefully.

2
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,477
It's your move.

3
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,688
Please put your heart into it,
will you?

4
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,900
I've noticed a certain tentative quality
in your thinking,

5
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,945
as if your mind were occupied
with issues

6
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,905
other than those on the board
before you.

7
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,534
Such preoccupation
not only weakens one's resolve,

8
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,245
but one's foresight as well.

9
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,330
A deadly failing in any match,
you must agree,

10
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:08,877
but in this particular contest,
quite disastrous,

11
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,297
as we play for grave stakes,

12
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:16,135
the likes of which
you have no doubt surmised.

13
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,264
Print your move in tomorrow's paper.

14
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,933
Or I will make it for you.

15
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:27,563
That tears it. Cooper,
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

16
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,899
Harry, if Windom wanted to kill me,
I'd already be dead.

17
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,903
Yeah.

18
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:39,074
- Better get Pete on the horn.
- Right.

19
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,578
Lucy, call Pete Martell,
get him over here right away.

20
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,037
Then call the paper.

21
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:48,000
Find out the latest possible deadline
for tomorrow's personals column.

22
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,502
Paper and Pete, got it.

23
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,379
I'll do it alphabetically.

24
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,012
She was beautiful.

25
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,018
She was the love of my life, Harry.

26
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,900
Okay, Lucy.

27
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,862
Okay, yeah, just tell Harry
I'll be right there, okay?

28
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,572
Right.

29
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,043
- Aah! Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

30
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,588
Ah? Ah?

31
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,302
Peter.

32
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,804
Salt and pepper.

33
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,307
Coming right up, poodle.

34
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,687
You two bring out the worst
in each other.

35
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:55,609
- Oh, Pete's a prince of a man.
- A court jester.

36
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,864
Well, I've got to mosey.

37
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:17,714
Goodbye, you sweet Packards.

38
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,763
Oh, Catherine.

39
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,767
Catherine, I'd always have hoped
that time and age would mellow

40
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,603
that tempest raging inside you.

41
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,231
Watching you two act
like the Hardy Boys

42
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,276
always brings on stormy weather.

43
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,987
What's happening with Ghostwood?

44
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,030
I talked to the investors,
the meeting is set.

45
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,532
I leave for Paris tomorrow.

46
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,286
Oh, company.

47
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,247
- Dear Josie...
- Huh!

48
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,045
I'm home, did you miss me?

49
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,885
Oh, she looked surprised.

50
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,222
Poor Josie.

51
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,558
Oh, she has her charms, though.

52
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,935
Yes, but not for long.

53
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,118
Come in.

54
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,248
- Hi, Harry.
- Save it, Hank.

55
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,502
What happened? Did you get up on
the wrong side of the bed this morning?

56
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,213
So I broke parole. Cry me a river.

57
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,342
You crossed the border into Canada.

58
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,802
You consorted with the drug dealers
at Dead Dog Farm.

59
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,305
You tried to kill somebody.

60
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,059
I'm charging you with
the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.

61
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,685
Ouch.

62
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,897
Well, I think it's safe to assume
that I was at the diner

63
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,774
the night that Leo was plugged.

64
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,026
- But you're welcome to call...
- I got a witness.

65
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,612
Puts you at the scene
with a gun in your hand.

66
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,740
Harry, you obviously seem serious
about this,

67
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:11,411
so I'm going to propose a trade.

68
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,914
How about information
leading to the arrest

69
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:18,251
and conviction
of Andrew Packard's murderer?

70
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:22,464
Hank Jennings,
witness for the prosecution.

71
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,092
No deals.

72
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,927
You're telling me
you're more interested

73
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,347
in the attempted murder
of Leo Johnson, felon,

74
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,015
than Andrew Packard?

75
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,309
How's that gonna sit
with your constituents?

76
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,395
You're through, Hank.

77
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,689
My guess is, Harry, not too well.

78
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,359
Especially once they find out
who pushed the button on Andrew

79
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,820
and that you're sleeping with her.

80
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,037
Gee, I'm sorry.

81
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,164
Get him out of here.

82
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,874
Get him out of here!

83
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,131
Give me that.

84
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,305
This is the bullet
we removed from you.

85
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,058
This is the one that was excavated
from the dead man's skull.

86
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:19,396
Same bullets, same gun, same killer.
Let's go get her.

87
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,773
- Albert, hold your horses.
- Coop,

88
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,860
I appreciate any reluctance you have
for busting your pal's old lady,

89
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,779
but the woman ventilated you
and left you for dead.

90
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,450
Albert, I don't take it personally.

91
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,493
What about the gloves,
the powder tests?

92
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,537
News at 5.
All right, fine, you're not mad,

93
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,706
but there's an epidemic
of multiple gunshot wounds

94
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,375
following this chick around.
She is a menace.

95
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,877
I'll talk to her.

96
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,838
Maybe she'll confess, turn herself in.

97
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,508
Maybe she'll grow wings
and join the circus.

98
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,902
Randy, I've got a list
of all our non-repeat guests.

99
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,238
We're gonna send them a special
invitation to the Great Northern.

100
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,366
Your enthusiasm brings
a salty tear to the eye.

101
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,826
However,

102
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,245
I think you will find my job requires
a little more

103
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,332
than a tight sweater
and a perky attitude.

104
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,292
Randy, I'm learning the business.

105
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,961
Every week a different department.
I don't want your job.

106
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,465
Yes, I look forward
to your stint in housekeeping.

107
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,052
This came for you this morning.

108
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,890
Good luck, Miss Horne.
You'll need it.

109
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,575
Hi.

110
00:08:56,118 --> 00:09:00,288
- I just checked into Room 215.
- Congratulations.

111
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,792
Strange, they told me at the front desk
I should talk to you.

112
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,294
What is it I can do for you?

113
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,588
Sorry, thought you were working.

114
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,757
I am working.

115
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,885
I'm working, see?

116
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,554
I see.

117
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,389
Audrey.

118
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,979
- Horne?
- At your service.

119
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,814
Could you send someone out
to the airport?

120
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,024
I'm traveling with some
heavy equipment this trip.

121
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,734
Didn't have enough room in the van.

122
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,445
- What flight were you on?
- My own.

123
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,699
On the jet out there.
Shouldn't be hard to find.

124
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,329
Is there anything else I can do
for you, Mr. Rockefeller?

125
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,624
No, thank you.

126
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,751
Yeah.

127
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,796
I have a picture of you.

128
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,258
You're wearing a little dirndl skirt, got
a white apron on, you have pigtails.

129
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,759
It's unbelievably cute.

130
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,430
I don't wear dirndl.

131
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,432
You did then.

132
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,436
It was right here.
The Great Northern dining room.

133
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,107
If I close my eyes,
I can almost see it.

134
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:13,278
Little Audrey Horne as Heidi.

135
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,536
Well, anyway, it's unforgettable.

136
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,707
Heidi.

137
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,335
I was 10. Hey!

138
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,214
Thank you.

139
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,904
"Save the one you love.

140
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,908
Please attend gathering of angels
tonight at the Road House, 9:30."

141
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,505
Nadine?

142
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,428
Honey, what are you doing home
from school?

143
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,514
Are you feeling poorly?

144
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,474
Don't.

145
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,520
Don't what?

146
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,315
Oh, Eddie. We have to talk.

147
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,317
Okay.

148
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,904
Mike and I are in love.

149
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,078
- In love?
- I hope you're not hurt.

150
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,792
I wouldn't wanna hurt you
for anything in the world.

151
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,545
Honest, you have to believe that.

152
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,341
But Mike and I, on that wrestling trip,

153
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:03,888
we had the most
magical night together.

154
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,141
All night?

155
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,187
Well, you and Norma did it.

156
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,442
Well, that's fair.

157
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,862
So, what's this mean?

158
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,199
Eddie.

159
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,414
We have to call a spade a spade.

160
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,751
We're breaking up.

161
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,671
Eddie,

162
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,341
I'm so sorry.

163
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:52,645
Josie, I want you to level with me
about what happened in Seattle.

164
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,439
I told you.

165
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,066
How many times
do I have to say it?

166
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,361
I escaped from Jonathan
in the airport

167
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,656
and I don't know
what happened to him after that.

168
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,743
Do you understand
I could arrest you right now?

169
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,120
I came here as a friend of Harry's.

170
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,540
Now, I don't know what place
he occupies in your heart,

171
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,668
but I do know that you own his.

172
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,963
I would think you'd like a chance
to explain yourself to him.

173
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,965
Please go.

174
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,311
This is the end of it, Josie.
There are no other options.

175
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,151
I want you at the station house
by 9:00.

176
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,529
Or I come and find you.

177
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,543
Oh, Josie,
I just saw Agent Cooper leave.

178
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,628
Was this a social call?

179
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,222
Dear, you look awful.

180
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,392
Is everything all right?

181
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,062
- I don't feel very well.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

182
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,648
I wish I had better news.

183
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,359
I've spoken to Mr. Eckhardt again
on your behalf.

184
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,278
While he's not
entirely unsympathetic,

185
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,197
he does insist on seeing you alone.

186
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,200
Tonight.

187
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,494
He'll kill me.

188
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,246
To tell you the truth,

189
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,290
my biggest worry is
what he's going to do

190
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,209
when he finds out
that Andrew is alive.

191
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,546
Won't Mr. Eckhardt think
that you've betrayed him?

192
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,965
But of course, you can tell him
that you didn't.

193
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,927
After all, you did actually think
that Andrew was dead.

194
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,763
Oh, no.

195
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,145
I don't know. I don't know.

196
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:02,317
Heh. Maybe you can help me.
I think I'm going mad.

197
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,032
You will simply have to face
Mr. Eckhardt

198
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,326
sooner or later.

199
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,078
Tell him the truth.

200
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,249
Tell him whatever you want.

201
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:28,134
Just pray that he believes you.

202
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,179
Oh, there they are.

203
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,925
No answer. He must be on his way.

204
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,426
Thanks, Bobby.

205
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,762
Look, why don't you join us?

206
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,347
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

207
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:19,811
You know, board meetings are usually
nothing more than a gathering

208
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,854
of self-minded individuals,

209
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,649
each more intent
than the other on financial gain.

210
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,109
No, thank you.

211
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,027
But today...

212
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,781
Today is going to be
something completely different.

213
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:38,037
Am I late? Hot dog, Ben,
look at you. How are you?

214
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,751
- You are a sight for sore eyes.
- Look who's talking.

215
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,295
- We taking good care of you?
- The best.

216
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,423
My luggage arrived.
Thank you, Audrey.

217
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,052
- You two have met?
- Briefly.

218
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,347
John Justice Wheeler.

219
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,224
Used to be in construction.

220
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,435
- Came up the hard way.
- How nice.

221
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,104
You remember my brother Jerry?

222
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,314
- That is Jerry. Oh, my God.
- Hi, Jack.

223
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:10,278
And this is, uh, my executive assistant,
Bob Briggs.

224
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,155
- Bob.
- Hey, what's up?

225
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,491
- Pleasure.
- Why don't you all just take a seat?

226
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:22,331
I've, uh, asked Mr. Wheeler
to join us on the board.

227
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,336
Years ago,
I made an investment in him,

228
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,880
a pittance,

229
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,466
which he built into an empire.

230
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:35,094
Now, I don't take any credit,

231
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,098
but I believed in Jack

232
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:43,102
even when he was a local boy
pounding nails.

233
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,690
I've asked him to return the favor
and believe in me now.

234
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,861
Ben, you're testing
my well-worn modesty.

235
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,657
All right, suffice to say,

236
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:01,829
Horne Industries Incorporated
have fallen on hard times.

237
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,456
The mill,

238
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:07,585
the Ghostwood lands, are now
solely owned by Catherine Martell.

239
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,464
We don't begrudge her,
the mill was and is, after all, hers.

240
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,674
So,

241
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,511
in spite of these reversals

242
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:20,348
and, uh, stripped of all the trappings
of success,

243
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,808
what are we left with?

244
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,144
The human spirit.

245
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,528
What is the greatest gift

246
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:37,490
that one human being can give
to another?

247
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,371
The future.

248
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,292
I give you...

249
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,841
...the little pine weasel.

250
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:59,554
Found only in our tri-county area,

251
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,473
it is nearly extinct.

252
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,226
- They're incredible roasted.
- Ahem.

253
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:10,064
According to an environmental
impact report,

254
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:14,652
what few pine weasels remain
will be all but wiped out

255
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,281
with the Packard plans
for Ghostwood development.

256
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,410
So you wanna save the weasel?

257
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,704
No, Bobby.

258
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,957
Not just the weasel.

259
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,211
But life as we know it.

260
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,840
I want Twin Peaks

261
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,551
to remain unspoiled

262
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,930
in an era
of vast environmental carnage.

263
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,185
So we block Catherine's development
until the wheel turns

264
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,644
and we get another shot.

265
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,731
That's brilliant, Ben. That's brilliant.

266
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,193
I plan to fight

267
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,529
this Ghostwood development
on every ground

268
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,074
and with every available weapon.

269
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,829
The little pine weasel...

270
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:12,251
...is about to become
a household word.

271
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,255
Then what?

272
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:23,638
Then I am considering

273
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,224
a run for the Senate.

274
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,525
Thank you.

275
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,538
Annie, it's no problem.
I've got plenty of room.

276
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:53,209
You just get on the next bus, okay?
And I'll be waiting.

277
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,462
Oh, honey, don't cry.

278
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,881
It's gonna be all right.

279
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,925
I'll see you soon.

280
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,969
I love you too.

281
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,845
Bye.

282
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,809
- So your sister coming?
- Tomorrow.

283
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,980
God, what do you have to do
to get out of a convent?

284
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,774
You just leave, it's not a prison.

285
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:21,195
Sounds like prison to me.
No TV, no boyfriends.

286
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,948
You know, when she was little,
I always used to think

287
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,285
that Annie was
from another place and time.

288
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,413
I guess the convent has been good
for her in a way.

289
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,791
Hard to imagine her out in the world.

290
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,962
Oh, look, here's something for you.

291
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,549
- Who from?
- I guess who was ever sitting there.

292
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,471
Look at this.

293
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,515
"Mountains kiss, waves clasp.

294
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:53,436
Flower, sunlight, the moonbeams,
is all this, thou kiss."

295
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,895
None of this makes sense.

296
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,607
"Save the one you love.

297
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:02,194
Please attend a gathering of the angels
tonight at the Road House, 9:30."

298
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,905
Sounds intriguing in a way,

299
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,699
but it sounds dangerous.

300
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,786
I wonder who this is from.

301
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,055
Norma Jennings, I've loved you
every day for the past 20 years

302
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,640
and I dream about you every night.

303
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,018
It's time for us to be together.

304
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,270
Will you marry me?

305
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,565
- Ed?
- We deserve to be happy.

306
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,276
It's our turn, baby.

307
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:20,231
All night long I held her in my arms

308
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:25,069
Just to keep her
From the foggy, foggy dew

309
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,613
Good job, fella.

310
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,116
Good boy.

311
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,620
Just a few more, and then we'll eat.

312
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:39,458
Fly to my breast,
Pierce me in colors autumnal,

313
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:43,421
speak to me only of love.

314
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,966
Leo, you have
an incomplete education.

315
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,136
For instance,
survival in the wilderness?

316
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,555
A relevant issue in your life,
my friend.

317
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:58,227
Now, this comes under the heading
of practical instruction.

318
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,729
I hope you've been paying attention.

319
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:01,981
Ow.

320
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:03,983
Whoo.

321
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,485
Nature is cruel.

322
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,947
This is also a lesson.

323
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,759
Hi, honey.

324
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,095
How are you feeling?

325
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,767
Oh, great, now that you're here.

326
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,523
Hank, I came here
to ask you for a divorce.

327
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:50,571
Well, first let me say,
I don't blame you.

328
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,282
You gave me a second chance
and I blew it.

329
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,244
I don't know
why I'm so self-destructive,

330
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,371
but I can see

331
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,458
that that's my priority in getting well.

332
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,668
I got a lot of work to do.

333
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,587
In fact, I decided

334
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,423
I'm gonna try to go into therapy.

335
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,301
I don't wanna be like this anymore.

336
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,056
That's very interesting, Hank.

337
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,059
But I have to get on with my life.

338
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,231
I know.

339
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,901
I know you do.

340
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,570
I just want you to be happy.

341
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,656
Thank you.

342
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,620
I want you to do me one last favor.

343
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,039
I want you to help me
get out of here.

344
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,669
If they send me back to prison,
I'll die.

345
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,837
Tell the sheriff
that I was at the restaurant

346
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,090
the night
that Leo Johnson was shot.

347
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,552
I was on my way home.
I can't prove it, but you can.

348
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,345
No more lies, Hank.

349
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,306
It's not lying,
it's trying to save my life.

350
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,475
No.

351
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,855
You're killing me here, Norma.

352
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,858
Don't blame this on me.
Don't you dare.

353
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,111
Is it Ed?

354
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,696
Is that who you're running to?

355
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,327
Okay.

356
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,496
Then here's the deal.

357
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:27,543
You give me my alibi
and I give you your divorce.

358
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,588
I didn't come here
to negotiate with you.

359
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,423
This is it, it's over.

360
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,383
Fine.

361
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,262
Go ahead.

362
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,017
You're his whore, Norma.

363
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:50,107
I'd rather be his whore
than your wife.

364
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:58,824
Norma!

365
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,996
Now, there are four or five
different ways of doing this thing,

366
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,123
and they all have their virtues.

367
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:10,294
I remember Capablanca and Lasker,

368
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,005
St. Petersburg, 1914...

369
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,548
- Pete.
- Yeah.

370
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,383
We've only got five minutes.

371
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,594
All right.

372
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,555
- Lucy.
- Sheriff?

373
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,973
Get the Gazette on the phone.

374
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,559
Tell them not to close out
the personals. We need more time.

375
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,604
- The Gazette.
- Okay.

376
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,482
That's it.

377
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,402
Guaranteed to cause
some sleepless nights.

378
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,863
As long as he can't remove
another piece from the board.

379
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:41,617
He can't do it.
Not at least for five, six more moves.

380
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,744
Maybe he'll kill anyway.

381
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,914
- Maybe it'll just frustrate him.
- I don't think so, Harry.

382
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,792
Earle has a perverse sense of honor
about these things.

383
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,462
I never heard of a man
who murdered by the rules.

384
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,005
Coop?

385
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,882
Albert.

386
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,219
Good work, Pete.

387
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,434
Here it is, straight up.

388
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,688
I got a match on the gun that
whacked you with the powder residue

389
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,398
on Josie Packard's gloves.

390
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,608
Seattle police have also
come up with an eyewitness

391
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,820
who positively ID'd Josie leaving
the car where they found the stiff.

392
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,530
If you ain't gonna bust this bitch,

393
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,659
- I would consider it a personal...
- Albert, I can handle it.

394
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,005
I think you just did.

395
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,352
Come in.

396
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,032
I assume
you still have a taste for bubbly.

397
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,785
We've killed enough bottles
in our time.

398
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,749
To beginnings.

399
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,461
And endings, and the wisdom
to know the difference.

400
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,048
I am sorry, Andrew.

401
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,261
I hated you at first, of course.

402
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,972
Perfectly normal response.

403
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,272
As my anger diminished,

404
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,401
I recalled that Eckhardt has a way
of persuading people to do anything.

405
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:43,197
- It was his idea, of course.
- Yes.

406
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,116
He made me do it.

407
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,660
And he said you never loved me.

408
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,747
You just married me
to get back at him.

409
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,624
That's not true,
I did love you very much.

410
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:58,545
Of course,
the same cannot be said for you.

411
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,047
Please, Josie,

412
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,758
let there be no more lies between us.

413
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:07,679
You had a job to do and you did it.
Now you're paying the price.

414
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,224
Every action has its consequence,
my dear.

415
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,144
The police are closing in.
If you don't take action,

416
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,356
you'll be sleeping in a jail cell tonight.

417
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,192
What can I do? Please help me.

418
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,069
You must see Eckhardt.

419
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:27,825
Perhaps you were meant
to be together all along.

420
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,119
I'm sure he truly loves you.

421
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,875
He doesn't know I'm alive.
He can get you out of this country.

422
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,505
Go to him, Josie.

423
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,425
Now.

424
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,599
Andrew.

425
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,727
We won't speak again.

426
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,417
Hi.

427
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,128
It's beautiful.

428
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,965
I wanted us to go someplace
we've never been before.

429
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,259
Come on.

430
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,555
How did it go with the police?

431
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,808
They asked a million questions
that I didn't know the answers to.

432
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,978
But the ones I did
must have been enough.

433
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,316
Evelyn's gonna stand trial
and I'll be a witness.

434
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,486
You're not wearing the ring.

435
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,114
I know about you and Evelyn.

436
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,077
I wouldn't blame you
if you hated me.

437
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,373
James,
I know what you were feeling.

438
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,876
I was feeling it too.

439
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,295
Evelyn just took advantage of it.

440
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,174
Well, it was wrong
and I should've known that.

441
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:12,387
Look, it's okay for you to feel bad
about what happened to you,

442
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,598
but I don't want you to feel bad
for me.

443
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,935
If we could just start over again...

444
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,438
Please come home with me.

445
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,899
I can't. Not right now.

446
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,450
You're right. You should go.

447
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,121
But what about you?

448
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,999
Can't worry about me anymore.

449
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,377
I've been a part
of all the horrible things

450
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,379
that have happened.

451
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,590
I wanna be a part
of something good now.

452
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,302
James, go.

453
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,055
Take all the time you need.

454
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,140
I love you.

455
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,270
I'm gonna miss you like crazy.

456
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,731
But you'll go away

457
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,775
and you'll come back
with great stories.

458
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:12,239
And none of them are gonna be
about Laura or Maddy or Evelyn.

459
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,283
And I'll be here.

460
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,330
- Come with me.
- No.

461
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,670
Well, then, I'll come back, I promise.

462
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,374
Coming.

463
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,420
Coming.

464
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,598
- Pete, I need to see Josie.
- Come on in.

465
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,893
- I think she's gone out.
- Yes, it's rather odd.

466
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,853
She took my car
without saying a word.

467
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,189
Well, she told me
the Great Northern.

468
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,108
Oh, did she? Well,
she took a lot of things with her.

469
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,610
I don't know where she was going.

470
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,780
But I'd say she was planning
to stay a while.

471
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,698
What else did she say, Pete?

472
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,328
Well, that she was going to see
an old friend.

473
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,954
Who?

474
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,960
Sheriff, I suppose it's been very hard
on all of us

475
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,379
learning the truth about Josie.

476
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,175
Catherine.

477
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,760
Who?

478
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,681
Eckhardt. Thomas Eckhardt.

479
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,143
Poor man.

480
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,784
Lobby, please.

481
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,166
Thomas.

482
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,421
We meet again.

483
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,843
I don't believe in ghosts.

484
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,137
Pity, it's an appealing notion.

485
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,807
The return of the grisly phantom
from the grave.

486
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,852
You deserve haunting, to be sure.

487
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,230
Look closer, Thomas.

488
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,899
I'm alive!

489
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,111
How?

490
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,822
Guess. It's really very simple.

491
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,199
Josie.

492
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,119
She warned me off herself.

493
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,747
Couldn't bear to see
her beloved husband perish.

494
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,416
Or more realistically, I suppose,

495
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,793
she felt there was
some advantage to be gained.

496
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,254
She betrayed me.

497
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,341
We're all familiar with betrayal.

498
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,678
Josie is mine. She belongs to me.

499
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:27,475
Oh, Thomas,
love will break your heart.

500
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,855
Happily, long ago, I lost interest.

501
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:37,110
But Josie loses her heart
with alarming regularity.

502
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:40,030
The local sheriff, of all people.

503
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,200
- I have taken care of that.
- I don't doubt it.

504
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:47,996
Sometimes I wonder
if our Josie

505
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,749
does these twisted things
deliberately.

506
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,751
Don't you?

507
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,964
As someone
who was once your friend,

508
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,759
I come back with a warning.

509
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,054
Josie is coming back to you,
be very careful.

510
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,350
I'm always careful.

511
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,021
Well, here we are, the lobby.

512
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,398
I'll be going back down
to the garage.

513
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,944
My resurrection remains
a well-kept secret.

514
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,910
Thomas.

515
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,039
Bye.

516
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:41,132
Hmm.
I know that I have a lot to learn.

517
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,718
Jack,

518
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,304
you shall be my teacher.

519
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:50,267
Think of me as an open book,

520
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,728
upon whose virgin pages
you shall scribe.

521
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,442
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

522
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:05,740
So, Mr. Wheeler, um,
what is it exactly you do do?

523
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,826
First off, call me Jack, please.

524
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,371
I buy bankrupt, failing businesses.

525
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,581
I streamline them,
bring them back up to speed

526
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,959
and then usually sell them.

527
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,669
At a substantial profit.

528
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,337
But not, I should add,

529
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,590
before making significant
environmental concessions.

530
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:28,263
No, when Jack is finished,
the waste is rerouted, the air...

531
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:36,563
The air is cleaner.

532
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,189
And the people happier.

533
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:41,192
Ben, you make me sound
like Santa Claus.

534
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,820
I'm a businessman, that's all.

535
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,196
Hmm?

536
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:52,329
You'll have to excuse me,
the chef just tried to stab Jerry.

537
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,456
You kids carry on.

538
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,374
Pay attention.

539
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,674
So, Mr. Wheeler,

540
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,677
which is it,
are we bankrupt or just failing?

541
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,555
I came to do an old friend a favor.
And it's Jack.

542
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,725
My father's friends are rarer
than the pine weasel.

543
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,227
Well, let's just say

544
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,521
that Ben was once
a very good friend to me.

545
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,483
So you came back
to bring us all up to speed.

546
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,195
You are Santa Claus, Mr. Wheeler.
I'd better hang up my stocking.

547
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,283
You don't like me very much,
do you, Audrey?

548
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,622
I don't have an opinion either way.

549
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,333
But if you did?

550
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,627
If I did,

551
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,797
I'd say that the Hornes have managed
to take care of themselves just fine

552
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,382
for more years than you can count.

553
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,384
And desperate
though we may seem,

554
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,595
will probably continue to do so
in the foreseeable future.

555
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,312
Indeed.

556
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,735
Where have you been all this time?

557
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,863
I mean, when you weren't busy
rescuing widows and orphans

558
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,908
and making our world
a better place to live in.

559
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,578
The far corners of the earth.

560
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,916
I tell you, it's glorious out there,
Audrey.

561
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:26,464
All in all, it's good to be home.

562
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,387
I'm only 18.

563
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,724
And what exactly does that have to do
with the price of eggs?

564
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,644
Nothing.

565
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,774
God, look at the time.
I have an appointment.

566
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,110
- Could you tell my father?
- Sure.

567
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,237
Okay. Um, see you.

568
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,865
Bye.

569
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,037
I'll see you later, Jack.

570
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,835
I'll see you, Audrey.

571
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,554
Hmm.

572
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:22,020
- Shelly? Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

573
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,856
I'm okay. How are you doing?

574
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,901
You know life. Drag?

575
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,445
Are you waiting for James?

576
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,905
No.

577
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,908
Actually I got this really weird note.

578
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,494
Somebody wants me
to meet them here.

579
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,662
That strange?

580
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,082
That is strange, look what I have.

581
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,252
It looks like
we all have something to talk about.

582
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,964
It fits.

583
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:55,386
See the mountains kiss high heaven,
And the waves clasp one another

584
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:59,682
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdain'd its brother

585
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:04,020
And the sunlight clasps the earth,
And the moonbeams kiss the sea...

586
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:08,775
What is all this sweet work worth,
If thou kiss not me?

587
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,986
- This is weird.
- I'll say.

588
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,510
Cooper here. Yes, Catherine.

589
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,888
No, no, I was just on my way over.

590
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,099
She's here?

591
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,227
Thomas Eckhardt's suite.

592
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,896
I see.

593
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,579
Help!

594
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,455
- Please help.
- I love you.

595
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:07,000
- No!
- Josie. For God's sake...

596
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,587
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me! Don't hurt me.

597
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,487
Stay where you are.

598
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,123
He tried to kill me.

599
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,960
Is that what you'll say about me,
Josie? That I tried to kill you?

600
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,963
What about Jonathan?

601
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,798
Did he try to kill you too?

602
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:59,218
He was taking me back.

603
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,679
Why did you shoot me, Josie?

604
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,766
Because you came here.

605
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,268
I knew this day was going to come.

606
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,438
I'm not going to jail. I can't.

607
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,317
Put it down, Josie.

608
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,364
- Harry.
- Put it down!

609
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,533
Harry, forgive me.

610
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,203
I never meant to hurt you.

611
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,761
Josie. Josie.

612
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,721
Josie.

613
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,978
She's dead.

614
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,817
Josie.

615
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:15,253
Coop, what happened to dead Josie?

616
00:45:45,451 --> 00:46:00,006
Oh, Josie.
