1
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,312
Hey, Mr. White. It's me. Um,

2
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,190
I know you're probably
real busy with retirement

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,080
but I got some news I think
you should maybe know about.

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,476
Me and Declan had some
differences of opinion

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,273
and it got a little...

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,879
messy. Um...

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,119
It's all straightened out now

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,398
but just a heads-up, there's been
a kind of change in management.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,791
Anyway, just thought
you should know.

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,475
Feel free to give me a call
if you want the details

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,791
but, you know, it's cool,
so whatever.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,630
Okay, then. Thanks. Bye.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,795
<i>Right, so there I am,
I'm on top of the train,</i>

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,350
pumping the water in, he's
watching to make sure we put in

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,830
exactly what he'd calculated.

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,351
We gotta be real precise because
water and methylene weigh different

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,040
and he figured it all out

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,590
to, like, milliliter.
I'm up there with my hose,

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,474
we're going as fast as we can.
We only got a few minutes.

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,792
At the crossing, we got this guy
who's smooth-talking the engineer.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,519
And it's all just going great

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,350
until this other dude shows up
in this monster truck

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,075
so we're pretty much screwed,
because he can just push

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,711
the entire dump truck off the tracks,
which, you know, is what he does.

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,200
Wait. What's your guy doing?

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,915
You can't stop him?
Yeah, but what's he gonna say?

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,677
"Thanks anyway, sir, but my friends
are still stealing cargo back there."

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,480
So I'm looking all around,
because I know we're not done,

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,597
but the gallons
are slowly ticking away.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,592
And finally Mr. White
tells me to cut it.

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,958
So I fling the hose, I'm grabbing
the cap, I'm screwing in the bolts.

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,112
Just, like, busting ass, you know?

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,594
And then I feel the train
start moving and I'm--

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,519
You're...
I'm on top.

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,155
Did you piss your pants?
Yeah, right?

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,633
So the thing starts speeding up,
so I jump off the moving train.

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,075
Like, total stuntman stuff.

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,596
It's like <i>Hooper.</i>
You ever see <i>Hooper?</i>

39
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,558
Oh, hey, man, Burt Reynolds.
Good movie.

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,552
He jumped out of a helicopter,
not a train.

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,154
Whatever, man.
It's a good movie.

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,990
This guy Jesse, he's underneath,
and the train just drives right over him.

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,510
And luckily
he's this skinny little guy.

44
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,634
Damn.
That's a tight operation.

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,395
It was perfect.

46
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,710
No one even knew they got
robbed, just like we planned.

47
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,630
Mr. White told me it was, like,
the biggest train heist ever,

48
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,638
like, potential money-wise.

49
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,991
So that's how that happened.
Ha, ha.

50
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,597
Can I get you anything else?

51
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,879
Nope. Thanks, darling.

52
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,077
I'm ready for the check.

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,240
You feeling good
about cooking?

54
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,872
Yeah.

55
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,874
You'll be able to
run your own lab?

56
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,839
Do it up right?
Yeah. For sure. I got this.

57
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,953
All right.

58
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,480
Let's make some money, then.
I gotta hit the head.

59
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,992
Ever been on a plane
and find yourself

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,356
looking down at the armrest
next to you,

61
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,560
looking at the little plug
where the ashtray used to go?

62
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,270
I look at that and I say, "What the
hell happened to this country?"

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,794
Nanny state.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,832
I see a kid with
a bicycle helmet on,

65
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,556
I wanna smack the shit out of him,
like, for his own good.

66
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,474
Mr. Pinkman.

67
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,032
How are you today?

68
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,276
Not so good, huh?

69
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,191
Of course, I might be able
to help you out.

70
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,597
I wanna talk to you about
your partner, Heisenberg.

71
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,558
See, I know
he's my brother-in-law, Walt.

72
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,831
Oh, yeah. That's the look.

73
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,437
Lucky for you,
I'm more interested in him.

74
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,832
So I got an offer.

75
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,996
If you help me out here,

76
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,559
tell me all about you and him
and your little meth business,

77
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,558
maybe I talk to my friends
at the A.P.D.

78
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,752
and make all this go away.

79
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,080
I know he's the mastermind here.

80
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,313
Plus...

81
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,871
I'm thinking,
based on your recent activities,

82
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,432
that maybe there's
a little trouble in paradise?

83
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,354
Maybe you guys aren't
getting along so good?

84
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,919
I'm right, aren't I?

85
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,638
Eat me.

86
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,155
Sure that's how
you want to play this?

87
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,120
Why don't you try
and beat it out of me?

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,595
That's your thing, right?

89
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,590
He really did a number on you,
didn't he?

90
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,996
I don't know,

91
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,957
but happy people
usually don't go around

92
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,715
throwing millions of dollars away.

93
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,316
I don't think

94
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,230
Walt's gonna be patting you
on the back for that.

95
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,917
But maybe that's the point.

96
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,152
But, you see, I get that.

97
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,877
My own brother-in-law,

98
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,152
lying to me for over a year.

99
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,279
Using me.

100
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,995
Maybe you understand
that feeling.

101
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,350
Help me out here, Jesse...

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,798
and we can put him away.

103
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,597
I know you want that.

104
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,872
I think you wanna talk.

105
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,153
Not to you.

106
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,154
Agent Schrader,
beat any good suspects lately?

107
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,074
Tall and taller, ask him
about his history with my client.

108
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,074
He knocked the poor kid unconscious
last time they were alone.

109
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,312
So, what'll it be, a civil rights
lawsuit the size of Montana?

110
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,039
Because I'll oblige you.

111
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,230
Oh. So long, Rocky.
Keep your left up.

112
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,357
Detectives,
I'm inviting you to leave.

113
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,753
I'm gonna try to remain calm,

114
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,470
but will you do me a favor
and tell me what is up with you?

115
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,792
My guys are busting their asses

116
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,397
trying to hide Walt's money
from the feds

117
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,711
and you're tossing yours
out a window?

118
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,352
And I have to hear about your little
act of philanthropy on the news?

119
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,318
Did you hit your head
or something?

120
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,200
Why didn't you call me
the second you got arrested?

121
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,079
What did you say
to Schrader?

122
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,152
Nothing. Jesus. Just chill out.

123
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,880
Chill out? No.
No, I don't chill out right now

124
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,475
because things
have gone nuclear.

125
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,194
I imagine Schrader shared
with you his recent discovery.

126
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,431
Okay, well, then you get
my complete lack of chill.

127
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,360
Just use the money
that I gave you.

128
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,313
No, Saul. Saul, I--

129
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,510
Stop-- Saul.

130
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,037
Stop talking. I don't care.

131
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,716
Just-- Just make it happen.
Work your magic.

132
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,997
And call me when he's out.

133
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,873
Hey, Dad, I'm home.

134
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,600
Oh, okay. I'll be right out.

135
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,754
Hey, you going to work today?
You were out late last night.

136
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,075
Huh? I-- Well, I, uh...

137
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,233
Yeah, I guess I just lost track of time.

138
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,473
Dad.
Huh?

139
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,474
I'm gonna head out, okay?

140
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,717
Where you going?
Uh, Aunt Marie just called.

141
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,079
She wants me to help her
with some computer thing

142
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,277
and asked me to stay for dinner.

143
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,999
That cool?

144
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,394
Uh... I guess that--

145
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,756
Cool. All right, see you later.

146
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,310
Wait, uh, son?

147
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,352
Junior. Hang on a second.
Yeah?

148
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,473
Oh, good. Come on back inside.
What happened?

149
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,996
Oh, this? Nothing.
No, I'm fine. It's fine.

150
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,072
Really. I do wanna talk to you, though.

151
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,078
Okay. Are you okay?

152
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,351
Yeah. Here.
Sit down a second.

153
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,794
I just don't wanna keep things
from you, okay?

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,117
I mean, you deserve to know
what's happening.

155
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,311
Yesterday, I passed out.

156
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,551
Briefly. Very, very briefly.

157
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,796
And I did this.

158
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,715
Why did you pass out?

159
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,159
Well, my latest scans

160
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,395
show a little shadow on my lung.

161
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,034
But my doctor put me right on
a new round of chemo,

162
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,311
which is why
I've been so tired lately.

163
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,233
But I was pushing myself too hard.

164
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,393
I know it.
I just don't want you to worry.

165
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,596
I learned my lesson.

166
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,239
Well, um, what's the...?

167
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,160
What now?

168
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,796
What now is that we go on,
like always. Right?

169
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,880
Hey, don't worry about this,
okay?

170
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,033
I know that's hard,
but I beat this once.

171
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,113
There's no reason to think
I won't again.

172
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,551
And my doctor says
I'm doing great.

173
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,474
I'm responding really well
to the treatment.

174
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,359
And I'm...

175
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,037
I'm feeling very--
Very good about this, all right?

176
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,800
And what would really
help me out

177
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,074
is if we all stayed positive.

178
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,718
Can we do that?

179
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,998
Yeah?

180
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,550
Hm?

181
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,632
Okay.

182
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,351
So why don't you go
and help your Aunt Marie

183
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,510
and we'll talk about this later?
No. No. No way.

184
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,396
I'm staying. I'm not leaving.

185
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,917
Flynn is not with you, is he?
No.

186
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,912
No. Why would he be?

187
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,759
How'd it go?

188
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,791
That bad, huh?

189
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,756
How bad are we talking, Hank?

190
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,238
I didn't tell them.

191
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,959
Why not?

192
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,436
It's just not time yet.
No, it's past time.

193
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,109
Way past time.
We talked about this.

194
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,636
You've got to tell them now.
It's gonna be worse

195
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,713
if they find out that
you've kept this from them.

196
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,112
Look, it's just I've got some
things I gotta chase down.

197
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,078
What? What things?

198
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,995
Leads, you know.

199
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,992
What leads? What? Something new?

200
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,920
I'm not keeping anything from
anybody, Marie, okay? Jesus.

201
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,231
Don't tell me how to do my job.

202
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,151
Walt.

203
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,715
Are you sure about this?

204
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,597
It's the only way.

205
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,435
Okay.

206
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,637
I'm ready.

207
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,714
My name is Walter Hartwell White.

208
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,315
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,

209
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,235
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

210
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,791
This is my confession.

211
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,552
They're here.

212
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,276
Thank you for coming.

213
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,837
Okay, I'll start.

214
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,674
Skyler and I--
Welcome to Garduño's.

215
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,036
My name is Trent.
I'll be taking care of you.

216
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,113
Can I start anybody off with
some beverages? Margarita?

217
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,670
How about some of
our tableside guacamole?

218
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,754
I think we're fine. We need
some time with the menu.

219
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,310
No worries.
Be right back with some water.

220
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,432
So you here to confess?

221
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,909
There's nothing to confess.

222
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,156
We're here to talk about Walter, Jr.

223
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,994
Flynn and Holly should be
living with us. End of story.

224
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,914
And while
we respect your opinion,

225
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,269
we think that your concern
is misplaced.

226
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,471
Skyler and I feel,
due to Marie's attempt

227
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,279
to lure him to your house--

228
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,678
I wasn't trying to lure him.

229
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,958
Regardless
of what you might call it,

230
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,909
Skyler and I
would like to ask you

231
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,353
to please leave
our children out of this.

232
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,434
Junior has been through
a lot already this year.

233
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,714
You are just...

234
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,037
This investigation, Hank,

235
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,874
do you realize
what this will do to him?

236
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,235
Hearing these things?

237
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,598
He's gonna hear it when I kick in
your front door and arrest you.

238
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,472
If that day ever comes,
so be it.

239
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,031
You have no evidence
to support your claims.

240
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,551
Why tear this family apart?

241
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,672
So how about that guacamole?

242
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,918
We make it right here
at the table.

243
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,280
I'll just give you guys
a few more minutes.

244
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,832
How can you sit there
and listen to this?

245
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,674
All we want is for those kids
to be safe.

246
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,150
You're putting them in danger,
keeping them under the same roof--

247
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,152
They are safe, Marie.

248
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,439
You yourself sent them out of the house.
And I brought them back.

249
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,230
Look, whatever you think he did,

250
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,960
this is not an ongoing situation.

251
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,310
Skyler.
No.

252
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,392
They need to understand.
It's in the past.

253
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,837
It's over.
There is nothing to go after here.

254
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,440
There's nothing to accomplish.

255
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,239
How can we believe
anything you say?

256
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,154
There's no telling
where the lies begin and end.

257
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,710
That affair of yours,
did that even happen?

258
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,920
Please. Look, Junior just found
out that my cancer is back.

259
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,070
He's already facing the idea
of living without his father.

260
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,631
To put this on top of that?

261
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,920
It's just not right.

262
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,800
I swear to God, you start
throwing the word "right" at me--

263
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,270
What I mean--
Was it right to run a drug empire?

264
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,318
There is no drug empire.

265
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,119
Lying to your son,
to all of us, is that right?

266
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,397
What do I have to do
to make you believe me?

267
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,517
Why don't you kill yourself,
Walt?

268
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,157
- What?
- Just kill yourself.

269
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,233
This whole thing dies with you.
That's what you're saying here?

270
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,236
Is that Hank should just let it go
and wait for you to die.

271
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,795
Well, maybe you should just
go ahead and die, then.

272
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,194
That is not a solution.
No, it's not a solution.

273
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,634
He's not getting off that easy.
Jesus, Hank.

274
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,759
And the same goes for you
if you stick with him.

275
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,354
Both of you think you're just
gonna walk away from this thing?

276
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,393
Never gonna happen.

277
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,951
That is not what we're saying.
Enough with the bullshit.

278
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,714
You're not gonna negotiate
your way out of this thing.

279
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,840
There's only one solution: Step up,
be a man and admit what you've done.

280
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,151
That's it. There is no other option.

281
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,718
Let's go.

282
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,789
<i>My name is Walter Hartwell White.</i>

283
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,640
<i>I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,</i>

284
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,470
<i>Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.</i>

285
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,391
<i>This is my confession.</i>

286
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,991
<i>If you're watching this tape,</i>

287
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,353
<i>I'm probably dead,</i>

288
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,357
<i>murdered by my brother-in-law,
Hank Schrader.</i>

289
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,194
<i>Hank has been building
a meth empire</i>

290
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,155
<i>for over a year now
and using me as his chemist.</i>

291
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,034
<i>Shortly after my 50th birthday,</i>

292
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,550
<i>he asked that I use
my chemistry knowledge</i>

293
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,873
<i>to cook methamphetamine,
which he would then sell</i>

294
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,950
<i>using connections that he made
through his career with the DEA.</i>

295
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,158
<i>I was astounded. I...</i>

296
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,757
<i>I always thought Hank
was a very moral man</i>

297
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,958
<i>and I was particularly
vulnerable at the time,</i>

298
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,679
<i>something he knew</i>

299
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,991
<i>and took advantage of.</i>

300
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,760
<i>I was reeling
from a cancer diagnosis</i>

301
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,630
<i>that was poised
to bankrupt my family.</i>

302
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,793
<i>Hank took me on a ride-along
and showed me just how much money</i>

303
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,794
<i>even a small meth operation
could make.</i>

304
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,158
<i>And I was weak.</i>

305
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,552
<i>I didn't want my family
to go into financial ruin,</i>

306
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,313
<i>so I agreed.</i>

307
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,959
<i>Hank had a partner, a businessman
named Gustavo Fring.</i>

308
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,238
<i>Hank sold me into servitude
to this man,</i>

309
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,797
<i>and when I tried to quit,
Fring threatened my family.</i>

310
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,952
<i>I didn't know where to turn.</i>

311
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,070
<i>Eventually, Hank and Fring
had a falling out</i>

312
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,277
<i>and things escalated.</i>

313
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,235
<i>Fring was able to arrange...</i>

314
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,509
<i>Uh, I guess--
I guess you call it a hit on Hank.</i>

315
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,593
<i>It failed,
but Hank was seriously injured</i>

316
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,036
<i>and I wound up
paying his medical bills,</i>

317
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,314
<i>which amounted
to a little over $177,000.</i>

318
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,713
<i>Upon recovery,
Hank was bent on revenge.</i>

319
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,793
<i>Working with a man
named Hector Salamanca,</i>

320
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,872
<i>he plotted to kill Fring.</i>

321
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,829
<i>The bomb that he used
was built by me.</i>

322
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,800
<i>He gave me no option in that.</i>

323
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,877
<i>I have often contemplated suicide,</i>

324
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,271
<i>but I'm a coward.</i>

325
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,070
<i>I wanted to go to the police...</i>

326
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,239
<i>but I was frightened.</i>

327
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,197
<i>Hank had risen to become the head
of the Albuquerque DEA.</i>

328
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,592
<i>To keep me in line,
he took my children.</i>

329
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,400
<i>For three months he kept them.</i>

330
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,076
<i>My wife had no idea
of my criminal activities,</i>

331
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,153
<i>was horrified to learn
what I had done.</i>

332
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,878
<i>I was in hell.</i>

333
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,310
<i>I hated myself for what
I had brought upon my family.</i>

334
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,911
<i>Recently, I tried once again to quit,</i>

335
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,154
<i>and in response, he gave me this.</i>

336
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,871
<i>I can't take this anymore.</i>

337
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,240
<i>I live in fear every day
that Hank will kill me</i>

338
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,514
<i>or worse, hurt my family.</i>

339
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,038
<i>All I could think to do
was to make this video</i>

340
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,673
<i>and hope that the world
will finally see this man</i>

341
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,631
<i>for what he really is.</i>

342
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,472
Who do you think
he's shown this to?

343
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,553
No one. It's a threat.

344
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,439
It's what he will do
if I don't back off.

345
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,237
I think you should
show this to Ramey.

346
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,471
Just get ahead of it.

347
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,469
That video is a bunch of lies, Hank.
Anybody who knows you will know.

348
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,878
A hundred and seventy-seven
thousand dollars?

349
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,752
Hell is he talking about?

350
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,239
Marie?

351
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,119
They told me
it was gambling money.

352
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,556
What was gambling money?

353
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,357
Oh, Jesus Christ, Marie.

354
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,115
Oh, God, no.
How was I supposed to know?

355
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,158
How was I to know
where it came from?

356
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,279
Why were they paying for my bills?
What about my insurance?

357
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,354
Insurance wouldn't have covered
the treatment you needed, and I...

358
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,115
I wanted the best for you.
Why didn't you tell me?

359
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,590
Because I knew that
you would refuse it

360
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,992
and without it, you may never
have been able to walk again.

361
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,753
Oh, Christ, Marie.

362
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,752
You killed me here.

363
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,955
I mean, it's the-- It's the last nail.

364
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,590
That's the last nail in the coffin.

365
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,672
What do we do?

366
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,280
If I were you,
I'd be more nervous.

367
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,597
Ugh. Jesus.

368
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,274
It's always the desert.

369
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,274
Uh, I already checked it.

370
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,399
It's clean. I wouldn't have
driven it here if it wasn't.

371
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,750
Get one of these,
by the way.

372
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,118
Reads radio signals.
Much easier.

373
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,880
What does he know?

374
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,794
I mean, he knows you're Heisenberg.

375
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,952
But I figure not much else,

376
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,277
otherwise, you know,
you'd be locked up.

377
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,150
What did he say exactly?

378
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,471
He wants me
to inform on you for him.

379
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,632
Tell him everything we did.

380
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,990
Anything else?

381
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,636
I don't think he's told
the rest of the DEA.

382
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,079
Why do you say that?

383
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,994
Just him being there all by himself

384
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,756
and, plus,
he was acting kind of shady.

385
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,435
Seemed like
he didn't want the other cops

386
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,274
hearing what he had to say.
Mm.

387
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,275
Are we gonna talk about the rain of
caca the kid brought down upon us?

388
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,274
Want to hazard a guess
what his little charity drive cost you?

389
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,511
Why don't you go
take a walk, Saul?

390
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,354
Jesse, will you let me help you?

391
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,393
I don't like to see you
hurting like this.

392
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,636
Maybe it's time for a change.

393
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,999
What kind of change?

394
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,273
I don't know.

395
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,675
I don't know, maybe...

396
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,634
Maybe it's time
for you to just

397
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,960
leave all of this behind.

398
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,879
Just get out of town.

399
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,838
Don't look back.

400
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,951
Saul knows a man.

401
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,357
He specializes in giving people
new identities.

402
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,150
He would move you
someplace far away

403
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,154
and set you up
with a whole new life.

404
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,272
Yeah, I know,
sounds a little extreme.

405
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,592
But maybe it's exactly
what you need.

406
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,839
You know, I really think
that would be good for you.

407
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,759
A clean slate.

408
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,589
All right, just think about it.

409
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,272
You get a job, something
legitimate, something you like.

410
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,796
Meet a girl,
start a family, even.

411
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,317
Hell, you're still
so damn young. Heh.

412
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,314
And what's here
for you now anyway?

413
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,716
I tell you, if I could,
I'd trade places.

414
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,158
A whole lifetime
ahead of you

415
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,233
with a chance to hit
the reset button.

416
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,717
In a few years,

417
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,993
this might all feel like
nothing more than a bad dream.

418
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,951
Would you just, for once,

419
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,396
stop working me?

420
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,279
What are you talking about?

421
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,032
Can you just stop working me
for, like, 10 seconds straight?

422
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,351
Huh? Stop jerking me around?

423
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,429
Jesse, I am not working you.

424
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,991
Yes. Yes, you are.

425
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,079
All right, just drop the whole
concerned-dad thing

426
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,471
and tell me the truth.

427
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,075
I mean, you're acting like

428
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,709
me leaving town
is all about me

429
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:52,473
and turning over a new leaf,
but it's really-- It's really about you.

430
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,718
I mean, you need me gone

431
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,874
because your dickhead brother-in-law
is never gonna let up.

432
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,997
Just say so.

433
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,720
Just ask me for a favor.

434
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,470
Just tell me you don't
give a shit about me

435
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,393
and it's either this...

436
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,550
It's either this or you'll kill me
the same way you killed Mike.

437
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,759
I mean, isn't that
what this is all about?

438
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,231
Us meeting
way the hell out here.

439
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,520
In case I say no.

440
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,513
Come on.

441
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,634
Just tell me you need this.

442
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,194
Your change.

443
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,716
If you'll hand this
to your car wash professional

444
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,951
and have an A-1 day.

445
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,994
Skyler?

446
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,396
Skyler, I've got my chemo
in about 45 minutes.

447
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,473
Can you take over
the register for me?

448
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,673
Skyler?

449
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,278
It worked

450
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,191
and we're fine.

451
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,718
Okay?

452
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,479
We're fine.

453
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,074
So Palmer and Castanares

454
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,749
are sitting on that jerkoff
Saul Goodman's office,

455
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,754
keeping an eye on Jesse Pinkman.
Yeah, I put them on it.

456
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,832
You wanna explain that
to me?

457
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,156
Yeah. Right.

458
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,996
Why the hell should I know anything?
They're just my guys, after all.

459
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,594
You gotta tell me what's going on.
Pinkman is A.P.D.'s problem, not ours.

460
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,314
You got a history with this kid.

461
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,597
If he catches wind
that you're trailing him

462
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,672
and this explodes,
he could sue.

463
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,959
Look, if I can't explain this
to Ramey, I gotta pull my guys.

464
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,439
Fine. Take them off.

465
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,513
I said, take them off.
What else you want?

466
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,759
I'm going out for a while.

467
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,153
You have that 3:00.

468
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,993
Will you be back?

469
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,710
You know what, it's gonna have
to be another day. Reschedule it.

470
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,073
Last chance. You sure there's
nobody you wanna say bye to?

471
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,038
Nobody at all?

472
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,714
No.

473
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,635
This is it. Once I make the call,
there's no take-backs.

474
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,800
Uh, I need a new dust filter

475
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,391
for my Hoover Max Extract
Pressure Pro, model 60.

476
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,791
Can you help me with that?

477
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,150
Yeah, pickup.

478
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,439
He's hot. Um, not "hot" hot,
just a little hot.

479
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,514
Currently out on bail.
Yeah, he knows the rules.

480
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,834
One hour.
Okay, he'll be there.

481
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,839
And done.

482
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,600
Okay,

483
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,195
this guy's fee is 125.

484
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,517
Your benefactor

485
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,320
asked me to send you out
with something extra.

486
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,914
Get you started, you know?

487
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,873
Keep you sitting pretty

488
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,879
until you get into the groove
of your new life.

489
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,040
Provided, of course, you don't
toss it out the window on the way.

490
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,112
Seriously, this is the last of it

491
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,159
so you might wanna think
about making a budget.

492
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,720
Hey, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

493
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,679
You can't fire up a doob
in here. Put that out.

494
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,752
I mean it. Put it out.

495
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,152
Look, Mr. Natural, I'm not
gonna let you sabotage this thing.

496
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,358
This guy is not gonna take you
if you show up high,

497
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,917
so stop screwing around,
or it's both our asses.

498
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,676
Right. Well, that's a start.
Now, give with the dope.

499
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,754
Christ.

500
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,072
Some people are immune
to good advice.

501
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,079
I'm gonna get a bag
for this cash.

502
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,392
Don't even think
about lighting up again.

503
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,958
Francesca,
we got any bags?

504
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,840
For money.
Money-sized bags.

505
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,757
Huell will drop you
at the pickup spot,

506
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,037
then he's gonna get
the hell out of there.

507
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,834
You got that?

508
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,993
Guy won't pick up the kid
if he's got company.

509
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,073
You got a phone?

510
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,840
Cops took it.

511
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,397
All right, in case
something goes wrong,

512
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,792
guy doesn't show, whatever,
you give me a call.

513
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,158
Seriously? Hello Kitty?

514
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,834
Seriously, it's free.

515
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,437
We got a beggars-choosers situation
here, so stop busting my balls.

516
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,159
Corner of Juan Tabo and Osuna.

517
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,030
You, you're gonna sit and wait.
This guy's punctual with a capital P.

518
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,079
Okay? So don't move.
Don't get up and get an ice cream.

519
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,432
Just stay put like a good boy.
He'll pick you up, you pay him.

520
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,831
He'll take your ID,
he'll give you a new one.

521
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,279
Goodbye, Jesse Pinkman.
Hello, Mr. Credit to Society.

522
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,873
So do I get to pick where I go?

523
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,356
Well, it's your life.
I imagine you get a say.

524
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,477
Want a suggestion?
How about Florida?

525
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,439
You get a tan,
meet the Swedish bikini team,

526
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,319
you know,
swim with the dolphins.

527
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,154
What about Alaska?

528
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,279
Alaska. Okay, well,
that's a different vibe.

529
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,636
I never figured you
for a moose lover,

530
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,315
but whatever floats your boat.
Alaska.

531
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,394
Alaska's good.

532
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,000
Anywhere you can get
a fresh start is gonna be good.

533
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,514
You ready?

534
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,478
Yeah.

535
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,476
Take care, Jesse.

536
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,917
All right.

537
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,680
Excuse me.

538
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,277
Hey, man, you can't go in there!

539
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,557
He a no-show?
Why didn't you call?

540
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,150
Why didn't you--?

541
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,315
Stop! Unh!

542
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,590
Code red!

543
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,956
Huell!
No! Hey!

544
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,395
Hey!
Get in here!

545
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,194
Back off!

546
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,999
You, stay where you are.

547
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,035
What? I don't know what
happened here. What did I do?

548
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,839
You stole it off me.

549
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,515
You and him, you took it
out of my pocket, didn't you?

550
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,196
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down. Yes. Okay.
I had Huell lift your dope.

551
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,795
I told you I couldn't risk
the guy not taking you.

552
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,510
No! Before. The cigarette.

553
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,320
You stole the cigarette.

554
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,359
What?
The ricin cigarette!

555
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,830
You had him steal it off of me!

556
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,435
And all for that asshole
Mr. White!

557
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,751
He poisoned Brock!

558
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,636
He poisoned Brock, and you--
You helped him!

559
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,918
Okay, Jesse, calm down.
Say it again!

560
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,515
Tell me one more time
to calm down! Come on!

561
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,552
I'm sorry. Yes. Okay.

562
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,320
I had Huell lift your cigarette,
but Walt made me.

563
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,552
He told me he was helping you,
he was saving you.

564
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,679
I never would've agreed to it
if I'd known what he was gonna do.

565
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,516
Jesse, you gotta believe me.
I didn't want any of this!

566
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,559
Back up!

567
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,154
Get off me!
What do I pay you for?

568
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,318
Hey, it's me. We got a big problem.

569
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,995
--eighteen, 19 and 20.

570
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,755
Actually, you gave me a 5,
not a 1.

571
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,799
Oh, I-- I did. I'm-- I'm so sorry.

572
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,032
Um, here you go.

573
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,759
Thank you for your honesty.

574
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,152
Oh, and please give this
to your car wash professional.

575
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,397
Have an A-1 day.

576
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,194
God.

577
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,240
Hey.
Hi.

578
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,598
What's going on?
Not much.

579
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,750
Yeah? Nothing?
Nope. Things are fine.

580
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,832
Good.
Why?

581
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,834
Oh, no reason.

582
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,271
You know what I found the other day

583
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,430
is that the-- The-- The latch
on the soda machine wasn't...

584
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,193
latching.

585
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,559
It's-- It's catching every time
that I stock that darn thing.

586
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,995
So I thought I'd check it out.

587
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,434
Great.

588
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,800
Thank you.

589
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,833
Oh. Exact change. I like that.
Thank you very much.

590
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,600
Okay.

591
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,959
And...

592
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,592
please give this
to your car-care professional

593
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,315
and have an A-1 day. Thank you.
Thank you.

594
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,279
I just remembered
they gave me a prescription

595
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,353
to go pick up, so... I forgot.
I'm gonna go

596
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,439
head on over
to the drugstore, okay?

597
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,796
Yeah, okay.
All right.
