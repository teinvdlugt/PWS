1
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:03,163
Diane, it's 6:42 a.m.

2
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,125
Rough sleep.

3
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,130
I had dreamt I was eating a large,
tasteless gumdrop.

4
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,674
I awoke to realize
that I was aggressively munching

5
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,802
on one of my Air-Pillow
silicone earplugs.

6
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,346
Hence the tastelessness.

7
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:24,393
Perhaps I should keep a closer eye
on my after-dinner coffee consumption.

8
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,399
Persistent soreness in the rib area,

9
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:34,570
which I'm treating each morning with
15 extra minutes of yogic discipline.

10
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:39,825
After which, thankfully,
the pain retreats to a cul-de-sac

11
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,328
in a distant suburb
of my conscious mind.

12
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,542
I'm going to begin today
with a headstand.

13
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,094
Diane, I am now upside down.

14
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,767
Mind becoming porous.

15
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:12,232
The day's tasks coming into focus.
Objects growing clearer.

16
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,544
Diane, the Giant was right.
I did forget something.

17
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,803
"I've gone north. Jack may have
the answer. Love, Audrey."

18
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,618
Hey. Thought we'd lost you
to the Kalispell woods.

19
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:08,914
Two retired female schoolteachers
live in that house next to the Palmers.

20
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,708
They have no memory
of a gray-haired man.

21
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,670
I had to drink three pots
of chamomile tea to find that out.

22
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,171
- Hmm.
- Which reminds me.

23
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,798
Would you excuse me for a minute?

24
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,007
- Sure.
- Thanks.

25
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,010
Mm. Keep looking for the
one-armed man. We gotta find him.

26
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,763
Excuse me, sheriff,
I just wanted to say goodbye

27
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,100
because, as you know,
I'm going down to Tacoma for two days

28
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,228
to visit my sister Gwen
and her husband, Larry,

29
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,729
who had a baby last week.

30
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,732
- Right.
- That is, Gwen had the baby.

31
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,486
Larry's the father.
You remember? It was a boy.

32
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,906
Well, anyway, as soon as
the Can-Do temp girl gets here,

33
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,826
I'll explain the phones
and the coffee and the intercom...

34
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,661
- Lucy, it's okay.
- And the wag...

35
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,579
We got it covered.

36
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,207
No, she should've
been here by now.

37
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:57,713
- I can stay and at least show her...
- Lucy, don't worry. Just go.

38
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,675
Sometimes the Can-Do girls can't.

39
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,263
- But, sheriff...
- We got it covered.

40
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,601
Have a safe trip, Lucy.

41
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,812
Thank you.

42
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,064
- Morning, Coop.
- Harry.

43
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,025
What is the word
on our delivery tonight?

44
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,944
We won't need it.
We've got the jump on them.

45
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,655
I know where Audrey is.

46
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,662
You see, the Port-O-Patient
will allow you to fluently, uh, transport

47
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,664
the unfortunate Mr. Johnson,

48
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,501
uh, allowing him to even go outside,

49
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,756
and sit and experience
what he can of nature.

50
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,841
- Mr. Pinkle, I want my cousin Leo
- Mm-hm?

51
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,594
To have the fullest possible
experience of life.

52
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:50,932
Well, that's what we're here for. Heh.
Okay, let's give it one more.

53
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,268
Mr. Pinkle,
are you gonna install the ramp?

54
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,812
Well, sure, of course, of course.

55
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,608
Uh, as a matter of fact,
I already have some...

56
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,942
Some plywood ramp...

57
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,738
Pinewood ramp boards
that I'll install tomorrow. Absolutely.

58
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:09,576
That's a very good suggestion.
Now, I think we are ready to go.

59
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,371
Finally. There we go. All right?

60
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,502
That's a new wrinkle.

61
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,505
I can't believe it. It was working
just so perfectly yesterday.

62
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,923
Come on. Come on...

63
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,675
You gotta be tough with this thing.
You gotta hit it hard.

64
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,930
A machine is like a woman, we always
say at the machine shop. Come on.

65
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,394
Oh, Bobby, are you okay?

66
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,398
Shelly, could you get Mr. Pinkle
a cold drink, please?

67
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,691
A diet soda, please.
That would be great.

68
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,944
Pinkle, Pinkle, Pinkle.

69
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,280
This thing is a death trap.
I told you we have to keep him alive.

70
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,367
The insurance companies
don't exactly pay off like the slots.

71
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,743
After we take our cuts,

72
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,205
we had only money for this
or a first-rate wheelbarrow.

73
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,167
Oh, thank you very much.

74
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,920
Oh, thanks a lot.

75
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,880
Bobby?

76
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,806
- I've gotta meet Leo's lawyer.
- The hearing's today, right?

77
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,101
Be just another second, folks.

78
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,729
Bobby...

79
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,150
...are we okay?

80
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,579
Oh, that's it.
Come and take a look. You can see it.

81
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,080
It works just fine.

82
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,293
Come outside with me.

83
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,881
He can let himself out.

84
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,218
Bobby, we're doing real good.
Okay, that's enough. Um...

85
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,557
Bobby? Uh...

86
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:01,021
Bob, Bob, I can't reach the switch.
Bobby, I've got a problem here.

87
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:16,036
Mr. Palmer has pleaded not guilty

88
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,663
to the charge
of murder in the first degree.

89
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,333
The defense has requested bail.

90
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:26,713
This pre-trial hearing is to determine
whether that bail will be granted.

91
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,341
Mr. Prosecutor.

92
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,927
We, the people
of the State of Washington,

93
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,180
move the defendant be denied bail.

94
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,140
On the basis of one,

95
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,602
the great seriousness of the crime
for which he has been accused.

96
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:45,273
Two, the apparently
premeditated nature of this act.

97
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:49,903
And three, the oft-witnessed
instability of Mr. Palmer

98
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,365
during the period
following the death of his daughter.

99
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,411
Sheriff Truman will speak
for the defense.

100
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,915
Your Honor,

101
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:07,045
Leland Palmer
is a well-known, well-liked,

102
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,631
well-respected member
of this community.

103
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,675
His roots go way back.

104
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,094
His grandfather, Joshua Palmer,

105
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,430
brought the family here
more than 75 years ago.

106
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,060
Your Honor, no one can know

107
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:27,190
what it's like to lose a daughter
the way Leland did.

108
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,610
That's all.

109
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,488
Thank you, sheriff.

110
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,408
Mr. Lodwick, would you care?

111
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,202
I thought I might sell this
to the Gazette.

112
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,497
They seem to like
courtroom sketches.

113
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,587
Yeah, why don't you try
for a little more face than that?

114
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,672
High standing in the community,

115
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,508
and the pristine nature of his public...

116
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,968
Just an idea.

117
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,762
Good. Thanks, sheriff.

118
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:02,100
The defendant is released
on his own recognizance.

119
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,686
Now, Leland,

120
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:10,400
as you know,
I will require you to remain in town

121
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,821
and making your whereabouts
known to the sheriff

122
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,865
on a regular basis.

123
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,910
Sid, check the calendar,

124
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,747
and we'll set a date
for Mr. Palmer's trial

125
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,958
as soon as possible.

126
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,143
- Hi.
- Hi.

127
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,563
Thank you.

128
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,027
Oh, mm.

129
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,699
So, what's behind those
deep blue eyes today?

130
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,410
I've got a proposition for you.

131
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,747
I'll share my life with you.
I'll tell it to you.

132
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,166
Part of your living novel...

133
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,212
...if you let me read Laura's diary.

134
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,093
It's intriguing.

135
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,600
I'll read it to you.

136
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,480
But it mustn't physically
leave this room.

137
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,858
Acceptable.

138
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,374
- You'll start?
- Of course.

139
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,043
A bargain has been struck.

140
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,374
Donna Hayward.

141
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,179
- Begin.
- All right.

142
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,223
I'm from Twin Peaks.
Actually, I was born here.

143
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,644
My father delivered me.
He's a doctor.

144
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,523
Where are you from?

145
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,321
I grew up in Boston.

146
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,492
Well, actually, I grew up in books.

147
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,876
There's things
you can't get in books.

148
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,340
There are things
you can't get anywhere.

149
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,303
But we dream
they can be found in other people.

150
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,391
Continue.

151
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,311
Maybe our dreams are real.

152
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,778
My turn.

153
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,823
What are you doing?

154
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,493
Maybe I'll read it out here
on the lawn.

155
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,454
Please.

156
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,791
We've only just started.

157
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,501
Why don't you come with me?

158
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,337
Come on.
What's there to be afraid of?

159
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,464
Come on.

160
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,469
Please?

161
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,931
Give that back to me.

162
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:22,235
Harold?

163
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,488
I'm sorry.

164
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,327
I'm sorry.

165
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,754
The defense will continue
with its evidence.

166
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,548
If you would, Mr. Racine.

167
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,342
You can see from these EEGs,

168
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,928
this chart here,
which is actually of my own head,

169
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,931
is intended to show
normal brain activity.

170
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,517
Objection to the use
of the word "normal," Your Honor.

171
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,269
Well, he's close enough.

172
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,855
Objection overruled.

173
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:06,905
This chart here is of Mr. Johnson
and shows minimal activity.

174
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,162
A previously submitted
medical report

175
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,625
states that Mr. Johnson
has suffered diffuse brain damage.

176
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,544
He doesn't currently
even have the perspicacity

177
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,547
to take the standard CST
competency test.

178
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,759
We therefore submit

179
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,346
that trying this individual

180
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,599
would constitute a mockery
of the justice system.

181
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,477
A proceeding that
the unfortunate young man

182
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,355
would not even faintly comprehend.

183
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,111
Mr. Prosecutor.

184
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,451
I know Leo Johnson
isn't in very good shape.

185
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:57,455
On the surface, it might seem
ridiculous to make him stand trial.

186
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,501
But the trial does more
than just punish the wrongdoer.

187
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:06,005
It also brings a feeling of justice
and retribution to a community.

188
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,384
Among the various crimes
Leo Johnson is suspected of,

189
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:15,181
the murder of Laura Palmer is the sort
that can wound an entire town.

190
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,976
As long as Leo Johnson
carries a breath,

191
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,645
- All right.
- he is as eminently deserving of a trial

192
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,356
as this community is
of a sense of resolution!

193
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,400
All right.

194
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,695
Now, have a seat, Mr. Lodwick.

195
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,326
Now, you fellas
can catch your breath.

196
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,747
I, uh, am going to need to deliberate.

197
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,293
Mr. Cooper, Sheriff Truman,

198
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,171
if I could have the pleasure
of your company.

199
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,594
Sid, can you fix us up with three
black Yukon sucker punches?

200
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,555
Yes, Your Honor.

201
00:16:55,764 --> 00:17:00,643
Lodwick really planted his feet
and looked it in the eye.

202
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,772
I didn't expect him to press
on the murder charge.

203
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,317
Cooper, is Leo Johnson our man?

204
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,737
No, sir. I don't believe he is.

205
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,949
Harry, what's the temperature
of the town?

206
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,327
Do they want a trial or a lynching?

207
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,414
They want the right man
brought to justice.

208
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,958
Well, they don't need a circus.

209
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,544
And this poor bastard,

210
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,963
he seems to be a heady cabbage.

211
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,299
Thoughts, Cooper?

212
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:35,011
I feel the killer
will eventually be apprehended.

213
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:40,808
You have to watch these.
They sneak up on you.

214
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,908
I'm gonna declare Leo Johnson

215
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,369
to be not competent to stand trial.

216
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,124
And when medically possible,
that he be shipped home.

217
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,423
Harry, uh, do you wanna tell
the little lady yourself?

218
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,259
Thanks, Clinton.

219
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,558
- Cooper, how long you been here?
- Twelve days, sir.

220
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,353
- They're not gonna try him.
- No?

221
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,106
Leo is coming home.

222
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,235
I'll advise you to keep your eye
on the woods.

223
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,489
The woods are wondrous here...

224
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,784
...but strange.

225
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,036
Thanks.

226
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,974
Can I get you anything, Nadine?

227
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,770
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

228
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,235
- You go to the high school.
- Well, yeah.

229
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:19,115
Heh. Yeah, it took me a second.
You're not in any of my classes.

230
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,784
Why don't you sit down, honey?
Let me get you a drink.

231
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,828
Oh, no, I'll get it.

232
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,374
Where are Mom and Dad?

233
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,961
Oh, uh, out of town.

234
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,421
Oh.

235
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,548
Okay.

236
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,468
You're a jack and I'm a jack
And Steeplejacks are we

237
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,220
Wow.

238
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,807
Doc Hayward said
to roll with the punches.

239
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,061
Have you thought about maybe
taking her to see Dr. Jacoby?

240
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,231
No, he's in Hawaii
recovering from that heart attack.

241
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,866
It just came right off.

242
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,218
Mr. Tojamura is here.

243
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,470
Mister who?

244
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,894
Excuse me. Uh...

245
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,315
- Do you have an appointment, Mr?
- Tojamura.

246
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,987
I represent Asian investment bank.

247
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,366
We have superior offer

248
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:47,870
for Ghostwood Project.

249
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,210
I have commitment letters
from Tokyo banks

250
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,379
prepared to move immediately.

251
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,215
This all sounds very interesting,

252
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:03,427
but unfortunately, I have an important
conference call in a couple of minutes.

253
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,304
I have prospectus...

254
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:10,810
- Perhaps some other time.
...and taste.

255
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,277
Five.

256
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,823
Million? Ah.

257
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,181
Leave these.
Let my people have a look at them.

258
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,683
Point of visit.

259
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,368
Cooper's on his way.

260
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,249
Your call from Canada, Mr. Horne.

261
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,044
- Is that our call?
- Yes.

262
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,504
You pushed it pretty close.

263
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,346
Benjamin Horne.

264
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,264
Are you ready to play?

265
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,141
Audrey.

266
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,562
- I wanna talk to my daughter.
- That can wait for tonight.

267
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,106
One time. Across the border,

268
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,735
five miles east of Grand Forks,
on the road to Castlegar,

269
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,446
is a bar called the Columbian.

270
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,282
Behind it
is a failed amusement park.

271
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,368
Go to the merry-go-round.

272
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,746
Leave the briefcase
beside the horse with no head,

273
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,665
at midnight, alone.

274
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,876
I'll be sending my representative.

275
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:12,932
Serialized denominations,
as you instructed.

276
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:19,188
My daughter's life is in your hands.

277
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,783
Stay by a phone.

278
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,168
Follow him.

279
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,922
Make sure that he and the money
are neatly delivered.

280
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,301
- Bring Audrey back.
- Cooper's not bringing her back?

281
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,555
Cooper isn't coming back.

282
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,682
If you can manage it,

283
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,811
bring back Audrey
and the briefcase.

284
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,655
Five million dollars.

285
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,783
Now, that's a good day's work.

286
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,586
All right,
once you're in Harold's apartment,

287
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,129
move as fast as you can.

288
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,131
This is scary.

289
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:31,177
Laura's diary is in a secret shelf
at the very bottom of the bookcase,

290
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,304
behind a row of fake books.

291
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,891
Now, I think that there's a doohickey
on the right-hand side

292
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:40,686
that somehow lets the shelf
slide out and down.

293
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,189
All the notebooks look the same,
except for Laura's.

294
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,691
Hers is smaller with a red cover.

295
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,902
How are you gonna get him
to go outside?

296
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,653
Not outside,
just out of the front room.

297
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,406
Then I'll signal you with the flashlight
through the window.

298
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,366
The door will be open.

299
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,786
I thought you liked this guy.

300
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,332
I do.

301
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,759
Okay.

302
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,179
Cooper hands me the briefcase.

303
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,639
I take it...

304
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,064
What about Ben Horne?

305
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,567
Well, he give up control
of One-Eyed Jack's.

306
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,444
It's yours.

307
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,988
With his daughter dead?

308
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,325
You know, you love a good steak

309
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,620
but you don't want to know
how it got on your plate.

310
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,624
You must be serious about
your business, Blackie.

311
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,668
How are you gonna do the girl?

312
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,172
Voilà.

313
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:06,230
- Does the girl sleep?
- Dreamland.

314
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,860
Come, come, come. Come to me.

315
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:19,285
In the other room,
the girl dreams of fishes

316
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,288
and dark lakebeds
and tangle weeds.

317
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,040
What about Blackie?

318
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,128
- I've waited long enough.
- We have our fun tonight.

319
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,215
Whoo.

320
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,135
Kiss me.

321
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,891
Right. Okay. Bye.

322
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,904
Laboratory Services.

323
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,032
Yeah,
I'm calling for some test results.

324
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,367
Doc Hayward said
I could just call you up and...

325
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,454
- Yes, what test was it for, sir?
- What's it for?

326
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,913
Yes, please, sir.

327
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:11,879
It was for a semen's analysis.
Brennan, Andy.

328
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:16,592
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you, sir.
- Sorry. Brennan, Andy.

329
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,512
Oh, the doctor's analysis
is oligospermia, sir.

330
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,266
Yes, could you go slower.
I wanna write all this down.

331
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:30,689
- Oligospermia.
- "Oligospermia."

332
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,817
- That's right.
- That sounds terrible.

333
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,612
- I have that?
- No, sir. You had that.

334
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,864
Oh, I had it.

335
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:44,787
- It means too few sperms.
- "Too few sperms."

336
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,914
Very good, sir.

337
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,666
You mean I'm cured?

338
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,001
Uh, the doctor says
they're not just three men on a...

339
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:55,839
"Doc says they're not just
three men on a fishing trip,

340
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,425
- They're a whole damn town.
- they're a whole damn town."

341
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,637
- That's right, sir. Do you understand?
- Yeah, I know what it means.

342
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,806
It means they're not really real
people, they're...

343
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,267
- I'm sorry, sir, I've got another call.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

344
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,062
- You're welcome, sir.
- Thank you very much.

345
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:14,400
I'm a whole damn town!

346
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:18,278
I'm a whole damn town.

347
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,573
Whoo!

348
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,036
Don't ask.

349
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,747
Where were we?

350
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:32,042
Okay, main bar
and greeting room here.

351
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,128
Casino and get-acquainted room.

352
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,966
- What's this, Blackie's office?
- We'll find out when we get there.

353
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,348
The one-armed man is staying in
the Robin's Nest Motel on Highway 9.

354
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,476
Nobody's seen him for at least
a day, a day and a half.

355
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,271
The room looks lived-in.

356
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,523
I found this.

357
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,067
Same drug as last time.

358
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,153
A weird, deep smell.

359
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,574
We're still waiting on Albert's analysis.
Good work, Hawk.

360
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,078
Hawk, see you in the morning.

361
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,177
Okay.

362
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,346
We'll approach through the woods
to the rear door.

363
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,850
Inside are stairs leading down
to the working rooms.

364
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,103
My guess is,
that's where Audrey's being held.

365
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,523
What kind of muscle do they have?

366
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:40,652
A couple of floor men in the casino,
probably more in the back.

367
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,906
Let's go get her.

368
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,332
- Good night, Andy.
- See you in the morning, Andy.

369
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,209
Good work.

370
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,510
"Gwen and Larry."

371
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,603
Adam's Abortion Clinic.

372
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,188
Hi, is Lucy...? What?

373
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,565
Adam's Abortion Clinic.

374
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,321
Oh, my God.

375
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,499
Can I get a cup of coffee to go?

376
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,836
- Hi.
- Hi.

377
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,963
Large, please.

378
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,925
- So you seen Donna today?
- No, sorry.

379
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,844
- You?
- No.

380
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,930
- So, what's with the coffee?
- Coffee?

381
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,516
It's for Uncle Leland.

382
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,394
You don't have coffee at home?

383
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,398
James, I can't talk now.

384
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,067
- I need to go.
- You need to go?

385
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,612
- Where are you going?
- Home. Bye, James.

386
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,519
Donna Hayward.

387
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:43,942
March 7th, Tuesday.
Second session.

388
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,237
Dear diary...

389
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,783
Uh, this is from a long time ago.
Is that okay?

390
00:31:54,412 --> 00:32:00,584
I was about 13 years old, 14 maybe.

391
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:07,674
Me and Laura put on our tightest,
shortest skirts. Too tight.

392
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,635
But Laura talked me into it.

393
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,350
We were going to the Roadhouse
to meet boys.

394
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,645
Their names are

395
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:26,068
Josh, Rick and Tim.

396
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,198
They're about 20 years old.

397
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,953
And they're nice to us.

398
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,925
And they make us feel
like we're older.

399
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,099
Rick asks if we wanna go party.

400
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,726
And Laura says, yes.

401
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:05,190
And all of a sudden, I feel this knot
building up in my stomach.

402
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,736
But when Laura gets in the truck
with Rick, I go anyway.

403
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,907
Stream in the woods.

404
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,702
Full moon, I think.

405
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,538
It's pale and light out.

406
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:27,254
Laura starts to dance
around the boys.

407
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,137
She begins to move her hips...

408
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:40,267
...back and forth.

409
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:48,150
Rick starts to clap, but Tim doesn't
do anything, he just watches.

410
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,612
Somehow, that makes me angry.

411
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,408
So I say, "Let's go skinny-dipping."

412
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,249
We take off our clothes.

413
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,336
I know the boys are watching.

414
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,090
Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick.

415
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,551
I don't know what to do.

416
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,138
So I swim away.

417
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,186
I feel like I wanna run, but I don't.

418
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,983
Tim swims out to me.

419
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,489
He kisses my hand...

420
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,534
...and then me.

421
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,503
I can still feel that kiss.

422
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:56,093
His lips are warm and sweet.

423
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,098
My heart jumps.

424
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,061
He's talking to me,
but I can't hear him.

425
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,899
Only the kiss.

426
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,363
I never saw him again.

427
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,617
It was the first time I ever fell in love.

428
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,836
That's all.

429
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,380
That was beautiful, Donna.

430
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,252
I got him.

431
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,322
Harry.

432
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,651
Wait here, Harry.

433
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,825
No. Dead end.

434
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,636
- Two.
- Audrey?

435
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:43,111
Not such a bad way to go,
all things considered.

436
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,072
No, no. It's beautiful.

437
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:50,201
- Is she alone?
- Nancy's with her.

438
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,122
What does she do for you I can't?

439
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,834
Well, something new.

440
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:20,023
Most people imagine orchids
growing in exotic, steamy places.

441
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,691
But you can grow them anywhere.

442
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,944
It's all basically a matter
of water and light, isn't it?

443
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,989
It's beautiful.

444
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,575
Here, look.

445
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:38,291
See, humidity is paramount.
Well, the control of it, I mean.

446
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,961
Too much moisture
is an invitation to disease.

447
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,423
Three sepals and three petals.

448
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:49,135
The bottom petal,
shaped like a lower lip,

449
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,554
is called a labellum.

450
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,265
So delicate.

451
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:02,232
Well, it's the landing platform,
really, for pollinating insects.

452
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,151
Romantic, isn't it?

453
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,978
Will you excuse me a minute?

454
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,639
Hi.

455
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:20,477
Would you take me
to Audrey Horne, please?

456
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:24,355
- I don't think she's available.
- Let's double-check.

457
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:47,295
It's not my idea, okay?

458
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,215
You're nothing but meat on a hook
to these people.

459
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,966
Shut up.

460
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,553
Audrey, can you hear me?

461
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,972
Mm... Who...?

462
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,233
My prayers.

463
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:12,153
Audrey, I'm gonna take you
out of here now.

464
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,926
No.

465
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:39,180
When you leave me with a kiss.

466
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:43,560
That's the way you want it,
that's fine.

467
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,520
Drop the gun.

468
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,523
Slowly.

469
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:37,030
Now, turn around.

470
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,132
Good thing you guys
can't keep a secret.

471
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,804
Good throw.

472
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,358
There's been gunfire.

473
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:16,319
Truman and Cooper are leaving
with your daughter.

474
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:22,575
Now, who can this be?

475
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,871
Monsieur Lodwick. DA's office, eh?

476
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,099
- Is something wrong?
- No.

477
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,975
You just frightened me, that's all.

478
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,943
Uh, come here.

479
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,070
Tell me about this orchid. This one.

480
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,506
Harold, no, you don't understand.

481
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,763
Maddy!

482
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,767
Wait!

483
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,023
Are you looking for secrets?

484
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,820
Is that what all this is about?

485
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,324
Well, maybe I can help you.

486
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,580
Do you know
what the ultimate secret is?

487
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,582
You want to know?

488
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,251
Laura did.

489
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,843
The secret of knowing who killed you.
