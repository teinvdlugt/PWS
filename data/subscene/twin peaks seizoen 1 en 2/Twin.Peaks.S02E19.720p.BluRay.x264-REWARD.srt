1
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,428
Nighttime or daytime,

2
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,307
once you get a few feet into this place,
you can't tell the difference.

3
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,061
Probably why
it's all remained so untouched.

4
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,688
One step at a time,
gentlemen. Keep your eyes peeled.

5
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,733
Over this way, to your right, Coop.

6
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,903
Harry, someone's been here already.

7
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,656
Look, they did our work for us.

8
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,158
Oh, my God.

9
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,333
I saw the same tracks
outside the power station.

10
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:11,964
Weight shift to the left foot.
A break in the heel.

11
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,049
Windom Earle.

12
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,093
What would Earle be doing here?

13
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,888
That's a frightening question
to contemplate.

14
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,267
Andy, I'm gonna need

15
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,478
an accurate large-scale
rendering of this petroglyph.

16
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,231
Harry, let's get Major Briggs
on the horn.

17
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,941
You want him to meet us
at the station?

18
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,901
That's the ticket.

19
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:55,382
Once upon a time,
there was a place of great goodness

20
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,343
called the White Lodge.

21
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:03,640
Gentle fawns gamboled there
amidst happy, laughing spirits.

22
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,895
The sounds of innocence and joy
filled the air.

23
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:13,525
And when it rained, it rained
sweet nectar that infused one's heart

24
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:18,947
with a desire to live life
in truth and beauty.

25
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:25,412
Generally speaking, a ghastly place,
reeking of virtue's sour smell.

26
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,372
Engorged with
the whispered prayers

27
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,709
of kneeling mothers,
mewling newborns,

28
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:35,005
and fools, young and old,
compelled to do good without reason.

29
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,551
But I am happy to point out
that our story does not end

30
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,096
in this wretched place
of saccharine excess.

31
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:47,100
For there's another place.
Its opposite.

32
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,687
A place of almost
unimaginable power,

33
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:54,191
chock-full of dark forces
and vicious secrets.

34
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,404
No prayers dare enter
this frightful maw.

35
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,242
Spirits there care not for good deeds
or priestly invocations.

36
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,410
They are as like
to rip the flesh from your bone

37
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,996
as greet you with a happy good day.

38
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:12,042
And if harnessed,
these spirits in this hidden land

39
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,087
of unmuffled screams
and broken hearts

40
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,923
will offer up a power so vast

41
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:24,596
that its bearer might reorder
the earth itself to his liking.

42
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:31,228
Now, this place I speak of
is known as the Black Lodge.

43
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,106
And I intend to find it.

44
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,275
Hey, man,

45
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,193
the story's cool,

46
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,779
but you promised me beer.

47
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,906
You told me
there was gonna be a party.

48
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:49,371
I mean, White Lodge, Black Lodge?
I mean, what's the big deal?

49
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:54,668
In time, young man.
Everything in time.

50
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:26,491
I think that I shall never see
a girl as lovely as Josie.

51
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,329
When she walks into a room,

52
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,666
the flowers all stood up,

53
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,128
to room,

54
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,173
doom,

55
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,594
fume, gloom...

56
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:51,933
I think that I shall never see
a girl as lovely as Josie.

57
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:58,398
When she walks into a room,
the flowers were all abloom.

58
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,528
- Oh, Josie.
- Oh, stop your incessant moping.

59
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,447
Give me a hand with this damn box.

60
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,702
What exactly
would you like me to do?

61
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,748
Open it. I've been trying for days.

62
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,167
Thomas Eckhardt
left this to me when he died.

63
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,754
And I want it opened,
I want it opened now.

64
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,049
Well, let's have a look-see here.

65
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,592
Do you have a key?

66
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:31,139
If I had a key, it would be open,
don't you think?

67
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,645
Well, it doesn't even have
a keyhole.

68
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,400
It's a puzzle box.

69
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:46,571
I saw one of these
at a crafts emporium on Guam.

70
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,992
I was there taking a little R and R
with the Doolittle twins. Heh.

71
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,203
There was a monkey show
you wouldn't believe,

72
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:57,165
and Dale Doolittle...
Now, he was the larger of the two...

73
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,419
Come to think of it, for twins,
they weren't all that much alike.

74
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,671
Peter!

75
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,841
Sorry, poodle.

76
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:11,721
The trick is to fit the pieces together
just so.

77
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,433
And how long will it take?

78
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:20,021
Well, this could take years.

79
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,696
Shel, I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the future.

80
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,991
And what it takes
to get ahead in the world.

81
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,745
I'm reading up, watching TV,
suddenly it hits me: boom.

82
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,498
The secret to success.

83
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,127
Beautiful people
get everything they want.

84
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,588
- Oh, Bobby.
- Yeah, think about it.

85
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,215
When's the last time you saw
a beautiful blond

86
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,926
go to the electric chair?

87
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,511
Eh...

88
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,639
You are very beautiful, Shelly.

89
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,936
And I think it's time we took advantage
of this beautiful people's conspiracy.

90
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,772
Know any senators I can marry?

91
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,900
Check it out.

92
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,153
Miss Twin Peaks.

93
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,990
Once we get that crown on your head,
baby, the sky is the limit.

94
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,243
Dream on, Bobby,
I have tables to wait on.

95
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,121
Shelly, listen, don't argue with me.

96
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,249
Bobby's in charge,
you understand?

97
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,170
We have to enlist
by this afternoon.

98
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:38,475
There's, uh, something
I want you to do for me, darling.

99
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,104
I'll do anything
that body and mind can stand.

100
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,068
Surely the last few days
have been proof of that, eh?

101
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,195
- Oh.
- Heh.

102
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,365
You just name it.

103
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,243
Um...

104
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,704
I wanna win
the Miss Twin Peaks contest.

105
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,665
You just name it.

106
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,420
I wanna win
the Miss Twin Peaks contest.

107
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,215
Oh, of course.

108
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,426
Well, I've been known to make
a speech or two in my time. Heh.

109
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,012
I'll coach you day and night.

110
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:20,642
Oh, now, sweetheart.
Baby, that's not what I'm talking about.

111
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,478
Now, you're one of the judges.

112
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,355
You can guarantee it.

113
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,026
But... But, uh...

114
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,279
It would be wrong.

115
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,490
Well, now, darling...

116
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,784
Darling, it would be love.

117
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,953
That's all.

118
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,374
You know,
I'd do anything for you, Lana.

119
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,751
You know that.

120
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:51,256
Yes, lover, I do.

121
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,767
- Good morning, Annie.
- Hi. Breakfast?

122
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,645
I've got four hungry lawmen
out in the police cruiser.

123
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,690
We need donuts and coffee. Hot.

124
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,234
Two black, two white,
no sugars, please.

125
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,487
- Coming right up.
- Oh, and Annie?

126
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,532
I'd like to take this opportunity
to ask you

127
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,327
if you'd like to accompany me
on a nature study this afternoon?

128
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,872
Nature study?

129
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,790
Sure.

130
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,418
How wonderful.

131
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,378
What?

132
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,006
When I talk to you,
I get a tingling sensation

133
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,091
in my toes and in my stomach.

134
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,135
That's interesting.

135
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,055
I don't think
it has anything to do with coffee.

136
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,059
- I'll get those donuts.
- Thanks.

137
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,150
Shelly?

138
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,278
You are beautiful, got it?

139
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,822
Use it to your advantage.

140
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,494
"What is all this sweet work worth,

141
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,038
if thou kiss not me?"

142
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,456
I beg your pardon?

143
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,586
Oh, it was an anonymous poem
someone sent me.

144
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,465
Shelly,
I need to see this poem immediately.

145
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,301
Okay.

146
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,681
It was in three pieces,
we each got a piece.

147
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,350
- Donna, Audrey and me.
- Thank you.

148
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,191
I need to keep this.

149
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,444
- Okay.
- Thank you.

150
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,157
A dozen donuts, four cups of coffee,
two black, two white, no sugar.

151
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,076
Thank you.

152
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,121
- Agent Cooper?
- Yes.

153
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,124
Uh, this afternoon?

154
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,294
I'll meet you right here.
Four o'clock sharp.

155
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,727
"Mountains kiss.

156
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,312
Waves clasp.

157
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,815
Flower..."

158
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,109
What's this all about?

159
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,904
It's a poem, Harry. Torn into thirds.

160
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:24,576
Sent to Shelly Johnson, Audrey Horne
and Donna Hayward

161
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,077
from Windom Earle.

162
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,872
You mean Earle's contacted
all three girls?

163
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,208
Are you sure?

164
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:38,548
See the mountains kiss high heaven
And the waves clasp one another

165
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:43,720
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdained its brother

166
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,056
A poem I once sent to Caroline.

167
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,894
I hope it's nothing more
than a taunt, Harry.

168
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:56,149
Earle takes perverse pride in his ability
to insinuate himself into innocent lives.

169
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,110
Well, let's talk to the girls
as soon as we can.

170
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,737
See what they remember.

171
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,452
Donna Hayward's poem.

172
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,042
Audrey Horne is in Seattle.
She won't be back till tomorrow.

173
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,920
Major Briggs is here
in the conference room.

174
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,671
Hawk?

175
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:24,219
Would you please bring me
Leo Johnson's arrest report?

176
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,555
Leo?

177
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,099
What's going on?

178
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,355
Putting the pieces together, Harry.

179
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,607
Deputy Brennan?

180
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,068
As I remember,
the line you are drawing

181
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,403
should proceed downward,
not across.

182
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,197
How did you know that?

183
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,077
Major Briggs?
Thank you, sir, for coming in.

184
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,498
Major, we need your help.

185
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,377
But I am unable to accurately
describe for you how or why.

186
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,170
Go on.

187
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,548
The Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department
is currently involved

188
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,591
in several disparate investigations.

189
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,011
The disappearance
of known felon, Leo Johnson.

190
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,638
The appearance
of my former partner

191
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,015
and suspected murderer,
Windom Earle.

192
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,351
And the discovery of petroglyphs
of an unknown origin

193
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,686
in a place called Owl Cave.

194
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,855
Now, it would seem
logic would dictate

195
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,191
that these investigations
be considered separate entities.

196
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,360
However, I believe otherwise.

197
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,863
I believe that these mysteries
are not separate entities,

198
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,991
but are in fact, complementary verses
of the same song.

199
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,618
Now, I cannot hear it yet.

200
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,495
But I can feel it.

201
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,163
And that is enough
for me to proceed.

202
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,291
How exactly may I help you?

203
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,294
I need to know everything
that there is to know

204
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,672
about Windom Earle's work
with Project Blue Book.

205
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,884
My security clearance was revoked
shortly after my disappearance.

206
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,220
And your ability to access
these Blue Book files?

207
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,390
Now, the issue is not one of access.

208
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:58,313
However, there are certain
moral judgments I must consider.

209
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,566
Yes, sir, I understand.

210
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:06,279
Will this information help you
to prevent future loss of life?

211
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,864
Most assuredly.

212
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,787
Is this a copy of the petroglyph
you found in Owl Cave?

213
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,540
Andy?

214
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,167
Sir.

215
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,336
Are you familiar with this?

216
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,755
Well, I've dreamed it.

217
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,259
Or seen it somewhere, somehow.

218
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,618
I will do what you ask.

219
00:15:56,372 --> 00:16:00,375
- Leo Johnson's arrest report.
- Good work, Hawk.

220
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,547
Gentlemen,
the damage to Leo Johnson

221
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,759
would alter
certain handwriting characteristics.

222
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,012
However, the basic style
would remain the same.

223
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,068
This poem,

224
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:32,115
sent by Windom Earle,
was transcribed by Leo Johnson.

225
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,167
Mr. Horne.

226
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,172
Mr. Horne, as you are no doubt aware,
there are but scant hours

227
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,216
until our wine-tasting benefit begins

228
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,219
and I can't find
your daughter anywhere.

229
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,264
Hmm.
Audrey is in Seattle for the day.

230
00:16:56,473 --> 00:17:01,144
However, I'm sure that our concierge
will, uh, be able to assist you.

231
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,895
- The concierge.
- Mm.

232
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,480
Heh, yes, capital.

233
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,816
- Thank you, Mr. Horne.
- Mm-hm.

234
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,443
Oh, uh, Mr., uh...

235
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,195
- Richard Tremayne.
- Tremayne, yes, right.

236
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,406
- Men's fashions.
- Men's fashions, of course.

237
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,907
Tell me, um,

238
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,286
how is your, uh, nose?

239
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,329
Oh, Mr. Horne, think nothing of it.

240
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:25,209
A nose is a small price to pay
in the service of a greater good.

241
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,878
Uh-huh.

242
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,007
Well, we will, of course,
pay, uh, any medical expenses.

243
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,718
How kind.

244
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,513
One might also think
workers' compensation

245
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,933
in some variety will be involved.

246
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,646
Easily done.

247
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,941
Capital, Mr. Horne.

248
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,526
I'll alert my attorney.

249
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,159
"I will alert my attorney."

250
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:03,998
Sometimes the urge to do bad

251
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,085
is nearly overpowering.

252
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,934
Drink up, my friend. We celebrate.

253
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,397
Celebrate?
I can barely move my arms. Heh.

254
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,445
You have lived your short life
in odium and obscurity.

255
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,156
But now, at the last,

256
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,159
you will step upon the larger stage.

257
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,994
I must confess, I envy you.

258
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,623
Your journey begins
at a point beyond imagining.

259
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,376
Who knows where it might travel
from there, huh?

260
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,294
I'm pumped.

261
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,047
Hey, is this for, like,
the Lilac Parade or what?

262
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,385
Uh, no, uh, not a parade, my friend,
not exactly.

263
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,305
Well, I'm real cool about helping out
and everything, but, um,

264
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,808
how do I get out of this thing? Heh.

265
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,935
You don't.

266
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,979
Leo?

267
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,690
Fetch me an arrow.

268
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,777
Arrow?

269
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,197
Whoa, man. Heh.

270
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,409
I do not appreciate practical jokes.

271
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,872
Leo, the arrow?

272
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,084
No.

273
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,133
Jeez, don't zap the geek.

274
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,719
How am I supposed to get
my beer without...? You know.

275
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,348
Dude. That hurts.

276
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,771
Fetch me the arrow.

277
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,831
Thank you, Leo.

278
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,713
What's with the arrow, man?

279
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,674
What are you doing?

280
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,261
- This isn't funny.
- Shh, shh.

281
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,556
- Be still.
- Well, what the hell are you doing?

282
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,935
Think of all the hapless sinners

283
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,188
wondering where
their souls' destination lies.

284
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,440
For what?

285
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,109
To gain the answer
to a simple question.

286
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,614
Where will my spirit awake?

287
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,868
What life am I given after this life?

288
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:53,626
This grave question has plagued
man's sorry conscience for eons.

289
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,171
And now, you, you lucky boy.

290
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,341
You have the answer.

291
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,301
Now.

292
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,399
Miss Twin Peaks Judging and Rules
Committee is now in session.

293
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,652
You know, this year
is going to be very exciting.

294
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,781
- Now we...
- Very exciting.

295
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,325
This year is going to be
very, very exciting.

296
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,952
Thank you, Dwayne.

297
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,912
Now, first order of business.

298
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,331
Mr. Ben Horne has asked
to address the committee

299
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,041
as a friend of the committee.

300
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,295
I don't have any objection to that.

301
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,006
Address away, Ben.

302
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,799
Thank you.

303
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:47,555
And, Dwayne, uh, let me congratulate
you on your, uh, recent engagement.

304
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,391
Oh. Thank you very much.

305
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,853
She's a lovely woman
and I wish you much happiness.

306
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,148
Well, thank you very much.

307
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,776
Ahem. Gentlemen.

308
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,321
My purpose is simple.

309
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:09,410
The age of the ogling, swim-suited
jiggle festivals of the past is dead.

310
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,331
Miss Twin Peaks, I believe,
and rightly,

311
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:19,837
is now a celebration
of the totality of a woman's qualities.

312
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,007
Beauty has taken on
a broader definition

313
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:28,429
to include mind, spirit, values, ideas.

314
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,640
And for taking this step, gentlemen,

315
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,059
I applaud you.

316
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,521
What's he selling?
What are you selling?

317
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,273
Mr. Mayor, let me get
right to the point.

318
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,651
Miss Twin Peaks is an event
in search of a theme.

319
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,737
Now, what I propose is simple.

320
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:52,161
The topic of this year's speeches
should be how to save our forests.

321
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,704
Hmm?

322
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:59,752
It's now, it's relevant,
it's global and it's, um...

323
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,090
Well, to put it plainly,
gentlemen, it's us.

324
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:11,430
Of course, uh, your opposition
to the Ghostwood development plans

325
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,849
wouldn't have anything
to do with this?

326
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:19,605
Pete, I resent your implication.

327
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:24,902
The environmental issues here
dwarf any parochial business concerns

328
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,990
that I, or you, or anyone else

329
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,909
might be pursuing.

330
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,787
We'll, uh, take it under advisement.

331
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,249
Ahem.
We'll take it under advisement.

332
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,292
That's the most
that I could hope for.

333
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,797
Gentlemen, thank you for your time.
Mr. Mayor.

334
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,885
He thinks he can pull a fast one.

335
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,931
The idea has merit.

336
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,766
I'm in favor of it myself.

337
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,020
- Ahem. Bobby.
- Hey, chief.

338
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,897
Don't forget
the dry-cleaning, all right?

339
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,108
Heh. Thanks.

340
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:16,495
Uh, will the first candidate
please approach the committee?

341
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,165
Lana? Come on up, honey.

342
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,638
Uh, does anybody smell a fix here?

343
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,558
I can't do this, Bobby.

344
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,603
I have never made a speech before
in my life.

345
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,772
I read a book report in the fourth grade
in front of Mrs. Gardner's class

346
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,358
and I passed out
right in front of the whole room.

347
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,820
You'll do great, doll.
I'm gonna be your speech writer.

348
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,405
Oh. Heh.

349
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,950
You're gonna be great.
Don't worry, okay?

350
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:02,249
- Here you go. Good luck.
- Donna? Are you entering too?

351
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:07,087
- Uh, yeah, you too?
- Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

352
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,798
- Isn't it exciting?
- Ha, ha. Yes.

353
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,592
Yes.

354
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,930
Mike, it's a long time no see.

355
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,683
I'd ask where you've been
keeping yourself but I think I know.

356
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,270
- This is very scary, Mike.
- It's not what you think.

357
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,357
It's not what I think?
What do you think I think?

358
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,484
You think I'm going out
with an older woman.

359
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:34,990
I think I don't know where you got this
sudden interest in the life of fossils.

360
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,117
Yeah, but...

361
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,577
It's not what you think.

362
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,540
Mike, big favor.

363
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,959
Clear this up for me.

364
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,670
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

365
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,381
I will strive to be understanding.

366
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,469
Do you have any idea

367
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,846
what a combination
of sexual maturity

368
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,975
and superhuman strength
can result in?

369
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,483
Whoa!

370
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,362
Sorry. Whoa.

371
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:39,847
Catherine, if there's anything
you can tell me about her, anything...

372
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,100
Anything at all
that might help me understand.

373
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,019
For instance?

374
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,897
What made her do
the things she did?

375
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,316
What was she after?

376
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:55,029
Hmm. I've been asking myself
a lot of the same things.

377
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,614
Catherine?

378
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,199
I need to understand.

379
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,663
I think that early in her life,
she must have learned the lesson

380
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:09,877
that she could survive by being
what other people wanted to see,

381
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,713
by showing them that.

382
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,800
And whatever was left
of her private self,

383
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,386
she may never have shown
to anyone.

384
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:23,932
- So all the stories, the lies were...?
- Well, who knows?

385
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,186
They may not have seemed
untrue to her.

386
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,484
What she needed to believe was
always shifting to suit the moment.

387
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,530
In spite of all the things
she tried to do to me and my family,

388
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,659
I find it curiously hard
to hate her for it.

389
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,037
Well, she was...

390
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,164
She was so very beautiful.

391
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,250
Hmm.

392
00:27:56,216 --> 00:28:00,552
There may be a clue
that could benefit both of us.

393
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,429
What's that?

394
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,186
Thomas Eckhardt left this to me
when he died.

395
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,147
It occurred to me that it might have
something to do with Josie.

396
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,732
What's inside?

397
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,194
I don't know.
I haven't been able to open it.

398
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,029
Let me see.

399
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,867
- Well, there's no lid, there's...
- No.

400
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,037
There's no clasp.

401
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,081
Wowee, Bob.

402
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:34,002
Have we got some beauties
in the contest this year.

403
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,212
Hello, Harry.

404
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,299
Seems like every gal in town
is lined up to take a shot at the...

405
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:43,846
Say, have you had any luck
with this thing?

406
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,515
- Oh!
- Butterfingers.

407
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,983
Holy moly.

408
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,818
What is it?

409
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:10,289
- Give it to me.
- Just a second, poodle.

410
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,960
Ah!

411
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,509
Now, I held it just so.

412
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,160
I used to swim here every summer.
Two or three times a week.

413
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,289
Then I made a good choice.
It's beautiful.

414
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,210
I always felt closer to nature
than I did to people.

415
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,880
- Why?
- I never had many friends.

416
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,508
Norma was always Miss Popularity.

417
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,760
She was always moving
toward the world.

418
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,470
And I was always
moving away from it.

419
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:10,349
- Lived in my head, mostly.
- That's not a bad neighborhood.

420
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,726
There's some pretty strange
neighbors.

421
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,606
- Many boyfriends?
- No.

422
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,816
Really?

423
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,860
Well, I had one.

424
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,278
High school?

425
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,571
Senior year.

426
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,576
Have anything to do
with why you went into the convent?

427
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,748
I'm sorry, do you mind
if we don't talk about it?

428
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,670
Not at all.
We can talk about whatever you'd like.

429
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,757
I wanna come back to the world.

430
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,843
I was so frightened for so long.

431
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,512
I understand.

432
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,932
Hiding from your fear
doesn't make your fear go away.

433
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,644
Makes it stronger.

434
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,732
So I had to face it.
I had to face myself.

435
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,611
And I had to do it here.
Where everything went so wrong.

436
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,918
Annie, I know how hopeless
things can seem.

437
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,674
I know about the dark tunnel
you can fall into.

438
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,217
It happened before I went away.

439
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,262
It happened because of that boy.

440
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,559
Something similar happened to me.

441
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,895
It made me wanna disappear
from the world.

442
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,357
Because of that,
maybe I can help you.

443
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,915
- I don't know you very well.
- No.

444
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,835
I'm trying to learn
how to trust my instincts.

445
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,797
What are they saying?

446
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,218
Trust.

447
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,662
Good evening. Evening, all.

448
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,332
And welcome
to our oenophiliac soiree.

449
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,335
Another in a continuing series
of public events,

450
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,629
sponsored by Horne Industries,

451
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:32,884
to benefit the Stop Ghostwood
Development movement.

452
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,178
Ono-what?

453
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,849
- Something to do with wine.
- And now,

454
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,101
to the tasting.

455
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,938
Lana, Lucy,

456
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,983
if you'd like to help me pour, please.

457
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:02,414
Our first wines this evening
are reds.

458
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:06,084
There are some schools of thought
who, of course, say,

459
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,337
there are no other wines
but reds. Heh.

460
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,173
Yes, Andy?

461
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:16,595
There are also white wines
and sparkling wines.

462
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,723
Thank you, Andy.

463
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,351
And now that we're all poured,
let us first examine...

464
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,520
Don't taste it yet, Andy,
for heaven's sake.

465
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,147
Spit it out.

466
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,902
Sorry.

467
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,780
That's all right.

468
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,075
That's what we're here for, to learn.

469
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,702
Now, to the wine.

470
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,456
We must first examine
the nose of the wine

471
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,709
to see what it can tell us
about its bouquet.

472
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,545
And we do that by...

473
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,298
By smelling.

474
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,594
Very good, Lana.

475
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,098
Hmph.

476
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:07,270
Lift the glass, thusly.

477
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,565
And while rolling the wine
vigorously around in the glass,

478
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:15,445
we breathe deeply and fully.

479
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,121
Very good.

480
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:30,836
And now, we take our first taste,
a big, boisterous gulp.

481
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,505
And we roll it around
our entire palate.

482
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,881
And we try to reach

483
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:39,678
those little taste buds stuck
way far at the back of the tongue,

484
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,013
remembering not to swallow.

485
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,015
Excellent.

486
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,228
And now, we spit.

487
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,945
So he came slowly out of the shadows,
leaving the dead girl behind.

488
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:01,241
And I said, "You take one more step
and I will ventilate you."

489
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,742
And then what happened?

490
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,911
It was a brief, but touching funeral.

491
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,167
Dale, glad I caught up with you.

492
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,170
Got the rental fired up outside
and about ready to hit the road.

493
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,214
Gordon, super
we caught you before you left.

494
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,508
- You hurry back.
- I will, Coop.

495
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,178
- Remember Annie?
- Of course I do.

496
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:25,056
This world of Twin Peaks seems
to be filled with beautiful women.

497
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,517
Although only one I can hear.

498
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,187
Join us for pie.

499
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,564
Love to.

500
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,152
- Annie?
- Thanks.

501
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,743
Three each.

502
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,788
- Shelly, do you mind if we share?
- No.

503
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:52,000
Coop, they say that love
makes the world go around.

504
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:56,087
Makes people who need people
the luckiest people in the world.

505
00:36:56,255 --> 00:37:00,926
Although they never said a doggoned
thing about a cure for hearing loss.

506
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,929
Shelly, you are a miracle worker.

507
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:07,349
And a goddess sent from heaven.

508
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,892
I'm a waitress in a diner.

509
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,228
I've never been compared
to a goddess before.

510
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,605
Well, Shelly,
you just don't know your own value.

511
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:18,485
Coop, she's a rare and precious
individual, don't you think?

512
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,903
I know what you mean, Gordon.

513
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:26,159
Shelly, turn around and face me
a moment before I lose my nerve.

514
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,370
I'm about ready
to leave Twin Peaks,

515
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,081
and I don't know
when I'm gonna return.

516
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,791
But I want you to know
that meeting you

517
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,459
has been more than a privilege.

518
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,795
It's touched my heart.

519
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,881
And I know
that if I don't kiss you now,

520
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,842
I'm gonna regret it
the rest of my days.

521
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,596
Hey!

522
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,725
What the hell's going on?

523
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,895
You are a witnessing a front,
three-quarter view

524
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,606
of two adults
sharing a tender moment.

525
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,484
Acts like he's never seen
a kiss before.

526
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,405
Uh, Gordon?

527
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:07,367
Take another look, sonny,
it's gonna happen again.

528
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,918
All right, class,
what did that sip reveal for us?

529
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,421
What flavors are we enjoying?

530
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,966
Tastes kind of woody.

531
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,511
No, not really.

532
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,472
Anyone else? Lana?

533
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,558
Um...

534
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,312
- Banana?
- Yes.

535
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:39,190
There is a hint of banana.
That's the metachloric acid.

536
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,525
Very good.

537
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:45,071
- What else?
- Banana.

538
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,656
Chocolate.

539
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,575
Correct, Andy.

540
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:52,329
Why don't we just skip the wine
and have a banana split?

541
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,542
Let's take another sip, shall we?

542
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:02,464
Swallowing this time,
and see what else we can discern.

543
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,802
What else can we taste?

544
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,930
What other wonder
invites taste buds toward pleasure?

545
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,599
Gosh, Dick.

546
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:17,812
Well, I just never knew wine
could have so many different qualities.

547
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,524
It's amazing, isn't it?
A really good wine is like a symphony.

548
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:30,367
And what is your reaction, Lucy?

549
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:39,334
I'm pregnant.
I'm not supposed to drink.

550
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,027
Love is hell.

551
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,114
Sorry?

552
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:12,033
Love, it's hell.

553
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,038
The Hindus say
love is a ladder to heaven.

554
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,168
The Hindus have also been known
to take hikes on hot coals

555
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,254
for recreational purposes.

556
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,131
Self-discipline.

557
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,175
Self-discipline and love?
There's a bad match.

558
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,010
Earthly love.

559
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,762
What other kind is there?

560
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,389
When you're in it,

561
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,015
no other.

562
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,686
It hits you like an 18-wheeler,
doesn't it? And there's no relief.

563
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,146
It makes you feel more alive.

564
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,565
It makes you feel more
of everything.

565
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,858
Pain included.

566
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,278
Especially pain.

567
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,491
I can't stop thinking about her.

568
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,660
Sounds like
you've got a pretty serious case.

569
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,121
Brother, I'm roped,
tied and branded.

570
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,998
She feel the same way?

571
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,292
Here's hoping.

572
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,256
How about you?
You on the critical list too?

573
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:12,594
Feels like someone's taking
a crowbar to my heart.

574
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,679
Hey, that's not bad.

575
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:18,808
No, I think it's been locked away
long enough.

576
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,144
That's good.

577
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,188
- Here's hoping.
- Here's to you.

578
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:30,320
- Mr. Wheeler? Telegram for you, sir.
- Thank you.

579
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,074
Thank you very much.

580
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,624
Damn.

581
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,627
- Bellman?
- Yes, sir.

582
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,754
Kindly tell the front desk
I'll be checking out.

583
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,256
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

584
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,134
See you.

585
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,887
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.

586
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,990
Would you pass the peas, Donna?

587
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,660
Thanks.

588
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,954
- Mom, could I ask you something?
- Sure.

589
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,331
How do you know Benjamin Horne?

590
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,708
Uh, Eileen, I told, uh, Donna

591
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,712
about the Heal the Planet benefit
you're working on.

592
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,464
Heal the Planet?

593
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,967
I saw him at the house.

594
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,261
You drove to see him yesterday?

595
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:41,641
Oh. Yes, he's offered to give us
some time.

596
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,228
I know he favors
several local charities.

597
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,771
Well, that must have been it.

598
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,191
One of the local charities
must have sent Mom's roses.

599
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,362
Uh, would you pass the peas,
Donna?

600
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,824
I think roses are really romantic,
don't you?

601
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,202
Donna, pass your mother the peas.

602
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,378
How's school going?

603
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,672
Great.

604
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:17,594
All the girls are real excited
about Miss Twin Peaks.

605
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,680
Fine tradition.
I worked with the pageant for years.

606
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,390
I entered.

607
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,560
Really?

608
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,605
You never seemed
very interested before.

609
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,273
Well, I guess I just figured

610
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,526
I could use the scholarship money
to study overseas.

611
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,395
We thought at first
it might be a bomb.

612
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:13,733
We don't exactly have a bomb squad,
so Andy brought his metal detector.

613
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,986
If it is a bomb, it's not metallic
and there's no ticking sound.

614
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,035
Harry, there was a time
when I could comprehend,

615
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:27,830
with a high degree of clarity,
Windom Earle's twisted logic.

616
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:31,709
But his actions of late
have left me completely bewildered.

617
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,962
He is changing the pattern
of the game board.

618
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:39,008
Any hope of deducing his next move
has evaporated.

619
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,552
Andy, would you please
direct everyone

620
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,389
well behind the police cruiser?

621
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,767
Harry, please stand back.

622
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,644
There could be plastic explosives
in there...

623
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,063
Agent Cooper wants everyone
back behind the cruiser.

624
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,065
- Chemicals,

625
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,859
and whatever else
hell could imagine.

626
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,612
My greatest fear?

627
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,659
Windom Earle
merely condescends to logic.

628
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:11,040
Leaving us the task of unraveling
an insane man's terrifying caprice.
