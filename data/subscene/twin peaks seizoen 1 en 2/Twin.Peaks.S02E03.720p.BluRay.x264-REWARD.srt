1
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,389
- Get her arms.
- I got this side.

2
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,226
Miss Pulaski?

3
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,812
- Cover her arms.
- Miss Pulaski, calm down now.

4
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,272
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.

5
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,485
- Get her legs.
- I got it. Hang on.

6
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,862
Miss Pulaski,
just calm down, please.

7
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,989
- You're all right.
- Give her a sedative.

8
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,492
No! No!

9
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:21,056
Ronette pulled out her IV.
I just gave her a sedative.

10
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,686
Looks like dye.

11
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,564
- Harry, give me a hand.
- What's this?

12
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,441
A little chloride.
Spray her finger.

13
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,735
Albert, get your microscope.

14
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,445
All right.

15
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,032
All right, Ronette.
Breathe, now, honey.

16
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,168
- He's been here.
- We have a 24-hour guard.

17
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,961
Harry, he did this.

18
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,504
And he tainted the IV.

19
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,673
Maybe she saw him.

20
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,219
Maybe she heard a Sousa march
and got up to look for her baton.

21
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,847
I'll do a workup on the IV.

22
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,724
That's our man.

23
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,518
Those letters were never made public.

24
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,272
Fellas,

25
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,733
let's stand together for a moment.

26
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,486
It's time I mentioned something.

27
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,947
Now, I'm not sure,

28
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,159
but I believe I was visited by a giant.

29
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,785
Twice.

30
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,287
In my room.

31
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,206
He left me three clues.

32
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,459
The first had to do with
Jacques Renault in a body bag.

33
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,420
It came true almost immediately.

34
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,799
The second was,
"The owls are not what they seem."

35
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,721
The third was about a man
who points without chemicals.

36
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,557
You were visited by a giant?

37
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,146
Any relation to the dwarf?

38
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,697
You're wearing a
different sweater than yesterday.

39
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,824
Color's better on you.

40
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,826
I forgot my manners.

41
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,328
I'm Harold Smith.

42
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,331
I guess you know who I am.

43
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,000
Please come in.

44
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,469
Would you like some lemonade?

45
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:26,014
I also have some saltines
and some apple butter.

46
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,683
Or would you
like to wash your hands?

47
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,184
No, thanks.

48
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,852
I insist.

49
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,991
It's very warm in here.

50
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,035
- Don't be nervous, Donna.
- I'm not nervous.

51
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,704
I'm curious.

52
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:52,916
Curious about my relationship
with Laura.

53
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,877
Why did you send me that letter?

54
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,589
Laura wanted me to get in touch with
you if anything ever happened to her.

55
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,091
Why?

56
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,386
She said you'd ask
a lot of questions.

57
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,930
How long did you know Laura?

58
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,934
Ever since she began
Meals on Wheels.

59
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,313
I was her best customer.

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,233
You don't seem
much like a shut-in.

61
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,195
You mean, politely,
what's the matter with me?

62
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,405
Okay.

63
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,782
I don't like to go outside.

64
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,160
I, uh...

65
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,708
...can't.

66
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,045
Do you have a judgment
you'd like to express?

67
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,546
No.

68
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,675
Laura said you were very fair-minded.

69
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,887
If you knew her so well, why didn't she
ever mention you to me?

70
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,682
Well, Laura liked to think of me...

71
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,519
...as a mystery in her life.

72
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,480
Then why did you call me?

73
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,650
I am...

74
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:05,280
Well, I used to be a horticulturist.

75
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,948
I raise orchids.

76
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,284
That's why it's so warm in here.

77
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,578
They don't need a lot of light.

78
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,955
I wrote to you because I wondered

79
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,958
if you'd be kind enough
to place one of them on her grave.

80
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,045
Of course.

81
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,634
- Will you excuse me a moment?
- Sure.

82
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,210
This is a hybrid.

83
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,255
A lady's slipper.

84
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,508
- It's very beautiful.
- Mm.

85
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:14,433
Take it, please.
My last gift to Laura.

86
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,936
That's very kind of you, Mr. Smith.

87
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,481
Harold.

88
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,861
She was very kind to me.

89
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,907
Forgive me, but I know so much
about you, you see.

90
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,410
What?

91
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,080
You're every bit as lovely
as Laura said you were.

92
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,384
I'll be back.

93
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,345
I'll be here.

94
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,067
R, B, T.

95
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,862
Harry, I believe that these letters
and the Giant's clues

96
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,406
are in some way related
to this long-haired man.

97
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,035
Mrs. Palmer saw him in a vision.

98
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,912
She called this morning
to say that Maddy

99
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,080
had seen the man twice
in the past two days,

100
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,582
both times in a vision.

101
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,293
I've seen him in my dream.

102
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,544
And Ronette.

103
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,464
- Saw him physically at the train car.
- Right.

104
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,634
Four of us have seen him
in different forms.

105
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:35,347
This path is a psychic link
that will lead us straight to him.

106
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,310
So, what did this giant sound like?
Hmm?

107
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,480
I mean, did he have
a big, booming voice or what?

108
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:47,734
- No, no. He spoke softly, distinctly.
- And you gave him the beans

109
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,945
you were supposed to use
to buy a cow?

110
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,489
No, Albert, I gave him my ring.

111
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,951
Okay,

112
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,287
confining my conclusions
to the planet Earth,

113
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,498
the cocaine you found
in James Hurley's gas tank

114
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,416
was a match to what we found
in Jacques' car

115
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,960
and Leo's house.
Get the picture?

116
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,169
Even got the frame.

117
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,504
Handiwork of Leo Johnson,

118
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,424
currently appearing at Calhoun
Memorial Hospital as Mr. Potato Head.

119
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,719
The boots are a Circle Brand
rare work boot.

120
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,930
Ones we found haven't been worn
or tampered with.

121
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,350
The letter B from Ronette's finger

122
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,436
was cut from a copy of Flesh World.
It's a perfect match.

123
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,897
This particular edition features
swingers' clubs

124
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,984
for standard poodle enthusiasts.

125
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,569
No comment.

126
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,280
We sent a portrait
of your long-haired man

127
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,366
to every agency from NASA
to DEA and came up empty.

128
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,285
This cat is in nobody's database.

129
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,538
A man that four of us
have seen here in Twin Peaks.

130
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,124
Sure.

131
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,085
Oh, by the way, you were shot
with a Walther PPK.

132
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,046
It's James Bond's gun,
did you know that?

133
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,258
You're looking better today, Coop.

134
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,468
Thank you, Albert. Feeling better.

135
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,679
The trail of the man who shot you
is ice-cold,

136
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,141
but I hoovered some fibers
from the corridor outside your room.

137
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,684
My ticket out of Trolleyville.

138
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,394
I'll be at the lab, gentlemen.

139
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,606
- Anything we should be working on?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,775
You might practice walking without
dragging your knuckles on the floor.

141
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,029
Albert, let's talk about knuckles.

142
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,239
Now, the last time,
I knocked you down.

143
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,492
I felt bad about it. The next time's
gonna be a real pleasure.

144
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,119
You listen to me.

145
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,996
While I will admit to
a certain cynicism,

146
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,248
the fact is that I'm a naysayer
and hatchet man

147
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,000
in the fight against violence.

148
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,877
I pride myself in taking a punch

149
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,337
and I'll gladly take another

150
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:34,341
because I choose to live my life
in the company of Gandhi and King.

151
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,885
My concerns are global.

152
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:42,265
I reject absolutely revenge, aggression
and retaliation.

153
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,143
The foundation of such a method...

154
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,688
...is love.

155
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,319
I love you, Sheriff Truman.

156
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:05,330
Albert's path is
a strange and difficult one.

157
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,711
Deputy.

158
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,383
James, you're not
gonna be charged.

159
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,177
The cocaine we found in your bike
was planted.

160
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,763
- I was trying to tell you that when...
- James,

161
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,765
I don't wanna see you
down here again.

162
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,141
Yes, sir.

163
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,894
Stop trying to
figure it all out yourself.

164
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,522
Find someone to talk to.
Talk to me.

165
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,316
Go on home, James.

166
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,030
How's it going, Lucy?

167
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,574
Seventy-five words.

168
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,702
Oh, wait a minute, 76.

169
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,831
- Seventy-seven.
- Good work, Lucy.

170
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,835
That's 78.

171
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,964
Agent Cooper asked me to find
as many words as I could

172
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,884
that contain the letters B, T and R.

173
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,763
Let me see.
I used to be pretty good at this.

174
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,902
My lunch date is here.

175
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,073
This is the date that made Andy
call in sick?

176
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,285
Hi, Lucy.

177
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,745
There you are.

178
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,581
Hello, Dick.

179
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,962
Lucy, I've always considered you
to be a woman of letters.

180
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,757
"Prohibited."

181
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,638
I say, I don't believe
we've met.

182
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,931
Richard Tremayne.

183
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,725
Horne's Department Store.

184
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,977
Designer Menswear.

185
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,271
Robot.

186
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,485
Did I do something to anger him?

187
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,946
Not that native people don't have
enough reason to be angry, per se.

188
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,408
- Let's go to lunch.
- Capital.

189
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,035
We'll go Dutch.

190
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:12,415
So how tall was this guy?
Did his head hit the ceiling?

191
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,376
- Almost.
- Whew.

192
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:20,048
I believe that the ceilings in The
Great Northern are at least 10 feet tall.

193
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,508
At least.

194
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,844
I'm sorry.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

195
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,642
That's okay, Leland.
What's on your mind?

196
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,895
This man.

197
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,522
I know him.

198
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,234
How do you know him,
Leland?

199
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,653
When I was a little boy,

200
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,531
my grandfather had a summer home
up on Pearl Lakes.

201
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,491
We used to go there every year.

202
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,202
- You knew him from there?
- Yes. Yes.

203
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,955
Now, I know that
he wasn't a Chelbert.

204
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,165
They were our neighbors that lived
on one side.

205
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,001
On the other side
there was a vacant lot.

206
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,629
Next to that was a white house.

207
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,631
That's where he lived.

208
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,342
Do you remember a name?

209
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,010
No.

210
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,347
I think...

211
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,350
I think it was
Robertson. Robertson.

212
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,560
Robertson.

213
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:17,814
Robert. R, T, B. That's what
the letters are trying to spell.

214
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,192
Hawk, get up to Pearl Lakes, find out
who used to live in that white house.

215
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,444
I'll do what I can.

216
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,113
Leland, thank you.

217
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,825
- That's valuable information. Thanks.
- Thank you, Leland.

218
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,535
Oh... Something else.

219
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,873
He used to flick matches at me.

220
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,713
He'd say:

221
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,757
"You wanna play with fire,
little boy?"

222
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,979
That's our man.

223
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,327
Of course, most of the time I keep
my department running like a top,

224
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,454
but Christmas...
Well, that was such a madhouse.

225
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,331
Was absolutely
no time for paperwork.

226
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,459
I simply had to develop a system
to memorize customer orders

227
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,586
using mnemonic triggers.

228
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,340
For instance,
someone looking for argyle socks?

229
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:30,178
Well, that would file under A
for "argyle," subheading S for "socks."

230
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,679
Now, it does get tricky.

231
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,516
A request for a vulcanized mackintosh,
for instance...

232
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,645
Now, does that file under R
for "raingear,"

233
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,563
or W for "waterproof"?

234
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:45,276
My familiarity with the inventory
finds me leaning towards an R.

235
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,905
Lucy, may I ask you something?

236
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,076
Do you find it odd that
I don't switch my fork when I eat,

237
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,120
that I lift it to my mouth
with my left hand?

238
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,666
My mother calls it piling.

239
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,252
Actually, it's not odd at all.

240
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,797
It's the European way.

241
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,302
It's been six weeks, Dick.
You said you were gonna call.

242
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,388
I know.

243
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,557
I lost your phone number.

244
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:20,603
I work for the sheriff.
You could've dialed 911.

245
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,024
Lucy, I do apologize.
I've been so terribly busy, honestly.

246
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,610
I've hardly had time to feed my cat.
Ha-ha-ha.

247
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,323
We went out every Thursday night
for three months.

248
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,702
You made promises to me. You said
you were gonna take me to dinner

249
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,913
at the Space Needle in Seattle.

250
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:43,251
Even though you took me to
Family Night at the Pancake Plantation,

251
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,879
I still couldn't help but think
that it meant something special.

252
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,134
When in fact the only thing special
we did that night

253
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,927
was drink two bottles of champagne

254
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,097
and end up on a display bed
in Horne's Home Furnishings!

255
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,983
I admit it was daring.
That made it exciting.

256
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,361
Still, I thought it would lead to more.
Like a phone call.

257
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,740
Lucy, I feel terrible you're upset.
Really I do.

258
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,160
- Let me make it up to you.
- Like how, for instance?

259
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,245
For starters,

260
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,540
I know I promised you a new dress
at my 20 percent employee discount.

261
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,792
After lunch, I'll go right back

262
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,047
and arrange something with Ms. Bolbo
in women's wear. Very special indeed.

263
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,008
Oh, yeah?

264
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,510
How about a maternity dress!

265
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,346
Pardon?

266
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,516
I'm pregnant, Richard.

267
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,685
Pregnant.

268
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,273
Preggers? Hmm.

269
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,861
Does Donna seem different to you?

270
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,529
What do you mean?

271
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,532
Well, like, doesn't her smoking
and stuff bother you?

272
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,369
She's trying to act, like, all tough
all of a sudden.

273
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:04,415
James, you know her
better than I do.

274
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,666
Yeah.

275
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,795
She came to visit
when I was in jail and...

276
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,089
I don't know.

277
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,424
What?

278
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,301
Well,

279
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,638
she acted like she wanted

280
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,516
to do it with me
through the bars.

281
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,644
She didn't even care
if anybody was around.

282
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,146
I don't know.

283
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,856
It was weird.

284
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,484
It wasn't like her.

285
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,819
I don't know.

286
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,363
I don't know anything anymore.

287
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,660
Sometimes I think I should
just get on my bike and go.

288
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,747
James.

289
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,918
Running away
won't solve anything.

290
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,059
It's gonna be okay.

291
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,232
Donna, where you been?
You're late.

292
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,610
I met someone
from Meals on Wheels.

293
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,738
Those old folks must have
some pretty cool stories.

294
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,282
This was a young man.

295
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,492
Really?
What's wrong with him?

296
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,996
You know, it's hard to say.

297
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,667
Other than he was bright
and charming, intelligent.

298
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,587
Completely unlike anybody I know.

299
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,505
What's that supposed to mean?

300
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:39,051
Why don't you sit here and hold hands
and try to figure it out.

301
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,068
That's good, Emory.

302
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,284
She's ready for her close-up now.

303
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,299
We should get rid of her.

304
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:22,428
She knows I sent Laura up here,
she knows her father owns the place.

305
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:27,016
With what Ben Horne will pay to get
his funked-up little daughter back,

306
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,809
I'll buy the bastard out.

307
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:32,146
Look, I don't wanna lose my job.

308
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,110
Honey, if this doesn't work,
you'll lose a lot more than your job.

309
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,239
We can't handle this alone.
Ben Horne is dangerous.

310
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:47,203
Now, listen, you spineless gasbag,
you are in this up to your shiny pate.

311
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,664
Now, stop whining.

312
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:54,710
You do as I tell you, and we'll have
all the help we need.

313
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,175
Look at her.

314
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,428
Riding the white tiger.

315
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,267
In a few days
she won't wanna come down.

316
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,646
Just like her daddy did to me.

317
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:18,484
Now, these babies
are just perfect.

318
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:22,655
For heavy field work,
and they're extremely versatile.

319
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:26,951
- Durable, with a steel reinforced toe.
- Not quite right.

320
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,705
Now, if the department does
any parading,

321
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:35,710
on the Fourth or Veterans Day,
these are your best bet.

322
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,044
- Nice, huh?
- Yeah.

323
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:41,299
Add some silver-trimmed laces,
it's a real eye-catcher.

324
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,427
I can see that. But a little outside
my budget, Mr. Gerard.

325
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,970
I understand completely.

326
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,097
- You need something more practical.
- Yep.

327
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,309
A shoe for all seasons.

328
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,396
Now, this is more like it.

329
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,108
Yeah. Jim-dandy.

330
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:03,070
Oh. Very popular.

331
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,450
The lovely thing about...

332
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,577
Mr. Gerard?

333
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,245
Mr. Gerard, you okay?

334
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:15,333
Oh. I'm sorry.

335
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,543
Sometimes I get
a bit disoriented.

336
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,546
Can I get you something?
Water?

337
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:25,259
If there's a bathroom,
I have a medication.

338
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:29,555
Sure. It's right down the hall.
This way.

339
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,197
Thanks for coming down, Shelly.

340
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,908
Sheriff, I'm just gonna say this:

341
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,119
I know I don't have to, so I'm not
gonna say anything against Leo.

342
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,121
We're not asking you to.

343
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,291
He's my husband. I don't have
to testify against my husband.

344
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:02,088
Well, you're not testifying.
You're just giving us a statement.

345
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,342
Doc Hayward says he's too sick.

346
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,053
What difference does it make?

347
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,931
The difference, Shelly,
is there's some people injured

348
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,974
and there's some people dead.

349
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,186
Now, we know Leo started that fire.

350
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,814
And we know you were there.

351
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:25,277
I'm not gonna say anything
against him.

352
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,365
I love him.

353
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:33,369
Okay, Shelly, that's fine.

354
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,830
- Thanks for coming in.
- What?

355
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:39,417
Oh, I think Shelly's thought
long and hard about this.

356
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,379
Maybe someday, with a little luck
and some topflight medical attention,

357
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,922
you'll have Leo back.

358
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,844
The same old Leo
that you obviously still love.

359
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:58,269
Maybe then he'll realize what
a wonderful person he's married to.

360
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,770
What?

361
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,772
Thanks again, Shelly.

362
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,649
Best of luck.

363
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,445
What's going on?

364
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,488
Smells like insurance money.

365
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,490
Shelly didn't dream this up herself.

366
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,701
So who do you think is
pulling the strings?

367
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,119
Harry,

368
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,037
that's a damn good question.

369
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,742
Bob...

370
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,497
...I know you're near.

371
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,130
I'm after you now.

372
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,945
- Mr. Horne?
- Tsk tsk. Gotta go, Jerry.

373
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,115
Mr. Horne, have you heard
anything from your daughter?

374
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,035
Not since I spoke to
Sheriff Truman yesterday.

375
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,995
She phoned me last night.

376
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,956
- From where?
- She didn't say.

377
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,958
She referenced seeing me
in my tuxedo.

378
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,795
Now, I was wearing a tux here
at the hotel the night that I was shot.

379
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:52,007
Well, like I told you,
Audrey's gone missing before

380
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,385
on a semi-regular basis.

381
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,845
So have two other
local girls recently.

382
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,431
Mr. Horne, speaking frankly,
is there trouble at home?

383
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,686
Mr. Cooper,

384
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:08,649
do I detect a note of something outside
the scope of professional concern?

385
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,735
Audrey and I have struck up
an acquaintance.

386
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,988
Acquaintance.

387
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,491
Agent Cooper.

388
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,787
Let me give you the best advice
that you're gonna get all week:

389
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,373
Men fall under the spell
of Audrey's charms

390
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,542
like ducks in a shooting gallery.

391
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,547
And if you don't want a
load of buckshot in your tail feathers,

392
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:36,385
may I suggest that you park your jalopy
outside of somebody else's window.

393
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:41,640
Mr. Horne, if I've overstepped my
bounds with my concern, I apologize.

394
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,101
I am here
with only the best intentions.

395
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,146
That is achingly clear.

396
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,398
And not unappreciated.

397
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,525
I'll put a lamp in the window,

398
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,613
you'll be my first call
when she comes home to roost.

399
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,031
Thank you.

400
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,743
No, thank you.

401
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,983
Welcome back.

402
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,277
Where am I?

403
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,822
I brought you something.

404
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,659
Open wide.

405
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,203
English caramels.

406
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,081
Sugar's what you need.

407
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,338
- Please...
- Go slow, baby.

408
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,548
Candy's dandy, huh?

409
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,510
Plenty more where that came from.

410
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,562
My name is Jean.

411
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,660
Sweet sleep.

412
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,956
Feel the warmth.

413
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,879
That's the man.

414
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,131
Oh, my God.

415
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,882
- You know him?
- FBI.

416
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,927
He's FBI. I saw him at the town
meeting after Laura died.

417
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,429
He was up here?

418
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,888
I want him.

419
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,641
Jean Renault. Emory,

420
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,395
say something weak and fawning.

421
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,188
Jacques was your brother?

422
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,735
And this is my sister. Nancy?

423
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,530
I also had a brother, Bernard.

424
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,866
This business cost me them both.

425
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,786
I told you we'd have help.

426
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,166
I'm your go-between.

427
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:16,420
The father pays me,
my cut is 30 percent.

428
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,298
The father never know
who snatch his baby.

429
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,259
And I get the man
who kill my brother.

430
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,886
What's his name?

431
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,097
- Cooper.
- Cooper.

432
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,975
And all you have to do
is bring him to me.

433
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,188
Mr. Horne can maybe do that.

434
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:38,525
But you're going to be a big help,
aren't you?

435
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:42,112
Whatever you want...
Want me to do.

436
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,907
The tape of the girl.
Get it now.

437
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,159
Yes, all right.

438
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,706
She goes back north,

439
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:58,128
- or this deal goes south.
- Jean, tell my sister to behave herself,

440
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,631
or you'll get mad.

441
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,174
She stays.

442
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,844
You get the money, I get Cooper.
Everybody happy.

443
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,974
Of course, we...

444
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,602
We can't let the girl live now,

445
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,395
can we?

446
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:19,358
No, no, no. Thanks, Pete.
I appreciate the call.

447
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,862
Harry?

448
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,864
Time for a break.

449
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:29,159
Josie called Pete.
She'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

450
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,245
Great. Let's bring her in.

451
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,330
Coop, I need a favor.

452
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,921
I'd like to see her first.
Alone.

453
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:45,133
Harry, we can't let personal feelings
interfere with our work.

454
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,844
Easier said than done.

455
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,973
Talk to her.
Bring her in.

456
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,892
You know there's a chance that
she's not involved with any of this.

457
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,144
Harry, you have my blessing.

458
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:01,608
Pearl Lakes. There's a vacant lot
next to the Palmer house.

459
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,111
Next to that there's a white house
all boarded up.

460
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,698
- Mailbox, no name on it.
- Title check?

461
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,034
County's working on it. Power and
Lights are searching their records.

462
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,745
- How soon before we know?
- Morning, earliest.

463
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,998
Hawk, you haven't seen Mr. Gerard,
have you?

464
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,375
- Shoe salesman?
- The one-armed man?

465
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,960
He came in to show me
some samples.

466
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,045
The one-armed man was here?

467
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,882
Yeah, he got faint
and had to go to the bathroom.

468
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,758
Never came back.

469
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:30,637
Harry, remember in my dream?
The one-armed man knew Bob.

470
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,444
What's going on?

471
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:59,166
"Without chemicals, he points."

472
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,169
The Giant's third clue.

473
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:06,298
Harry, we've got to find
the one-armed man.

474
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,355
Is that really necessary, doc?

475
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,231
It's for her own protection, Ed.

476
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,776
She ripped two pair
of leather restraints last night

477
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,237
like tissue paper.
I ran a blood test.

478
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,449
She's pumping out more adrenaline
than a wildcat well.

479
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,534
Never seen anything like it.

480
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,788
Now, your being here
may quiet her.

481
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,833
Talk to her. Maybe sing.
She got a favorite song?

482
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,919
Favorite song?

483
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,005
Beats a trip to Lourdes.

484
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,007
Okay.

485
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:53,428
But if I'm gonna sing to her, doc,
I'd rather it was just the two of us.

486
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:57,599
I'll close the door behind me.

487
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,983
Nadine?

488
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,486
Doc says I should sing a song for you.

489
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:14,199
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm not sure what you'd like to hear.

490
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,294
On top of Old Smokey

491
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,590
All covered with snow

492
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:35,429
I lost my true lover

493
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:39,349
A-courtin' too slow

494
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,312
Courting's a pleasure

495
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,608
Parting's a grief

496
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,111
A false-hearted lover

497
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:57,284
Is worse than a thief

498
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,621
Good God.

499
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,257
You're a jack and I'm a jack
And Steeplejacks are we

500
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,259
And when we climb up to the top

501
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,803
The cry is victory!

502
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:20,515
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y!

503
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,726
Vi...

504
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,228
Hi, Eddie.

505
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,439
Did you come by
to pick me up?

506
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,941
Uh-huh.

507
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:34,279
Doc Hayward says
tonsillitis or no tonsillitis,

508
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,324
I can go to cheerleading tryouts.

509
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,576
Cheerleader tryouts?

510
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,871
Well, I'm a senior, Eddie.

511
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,624
You know what they say. Heh.

512
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,629
You're only 18 once.

513
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,708
Dr. Jacoby?

514
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,336
Gents. Come on in.

515
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,923
This is my wife, Eolani.

516
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:38,969
She lives at our place in Hanalei.

517
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:44,724
We're... Well, we're practicing
a kind of creative kahuna healing.

518
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,935
- How do you do?
- Ma'am.

519
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,480
Are you ready to be hypnotized?

520
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:55,443
Oh. Yes, yes.
I've been under many times.

521
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:00,824
This is the autosuggestion program
that I use.

522
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,660
Eolani, start the tape, please.

523
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,204
Sheriff Truman.

524
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:12,169
Would you hold this stone, please,
at the end of the bed there?

525
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,464
Great. Just...

526
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,467
Yes. Whoa.

527
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:25,265
Okay, Agent Cooper.
I'm ready.

528
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:31,146
"You are standing on
a smooth, green carpet of grass.

529
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,524
The ball is 15 feet from the hole.

530
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:41,364
Beyond the green,
two pristine white sand traps

531
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,619
and a lily-filled pond yawn out
towards the emerald fairway.

532
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:49,497
The hole seems to slowly drift away
across the green

533
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,918
towards the pond,
carried by the summer wind.

534
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:56,463
The green grows larger and larger.

535
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,548
The green engulfs you,

536
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:03,011
enveloping you
in a soft blanket of peace.

537
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,638
Harry.

538
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,017
You stroke the ball.

539
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:15,232
It drifts towards the hole
and gently drops in its center."

540
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,692
Can you hear me, Dr. Jacoby?

541
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,819
Yes.

542
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:24,616
You're in your hospital room.
In the room is Jacques Renault.

543
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:29,037
Do you smell anything?
Burned engine oil?

544
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,749
I smell engine oil at the park.

545
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,960
Air is filled with it.

546
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,713
All right, we're going back to your room
at the hospital now.

547
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,799
Does anyone come into the room?

548
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,509
Nurses,

549
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,135
Doc Hayward.

550
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,596
You, Sheriff Truman.

551
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,348
What happens after we leave?

552
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,893
I dream I'm at Hanauma Bay.

553
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,646
I'm juggling coconuts at a luau.

554
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,108
The guests are all Nigerians.

555
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,402
All right.

556
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,363
Does anyone else come into the room,
later that night?

557
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,784
The sound of the tape ripping
wakes me up.

558
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,829
I see a pillow going over his face.

559
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,165
He's making this sound.

560
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,630
Almost like a dog barking.

561
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,341
Jacques stops moving.

562
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,761
I look up to see
who's holding the pillow.

563
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,388
Who is it?

564
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,889
Do you see who it is?

565
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,766
I know him.

566
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,955
Hi.

567
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,836
This is from Harold Smith.

568
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,132
Sorry I haven't been out
to see you since the funeral,

569
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,926
but things have been
pretty strange.

570
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,556
So were you sleeping with
this guy Harold or what?

571
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,933
He seems pretty nice.

572
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,311
Kind of an oddball.

573
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,525
Although, I guess anyone
can start to seem like that

574
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,944
when you look close enough.

575
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,825
We need to talk.

576
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,079
Maybe you already know
about me and James.

577
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:39,793
But anyway, after you died,
we kind of got together.

578
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,713
This isn't something
I feel like I have to explain to you

579
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,468
because you probably knew
how we felt before we did.

580
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,390
How can you be so smart
about things like that...

581
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,852
...and so stupid
about so much else?

582
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,607
I'm mad at you.

583
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:06,945
When it was you and me
and James, it kind of worked.

584
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,488
Now you're gone.

585
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,782
I love James.

586
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,076
And it's a mess.

587
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,955
Your cousin Maddy's here,

588
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,667
and I think there's something going on
between the two of them.

589
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:25,880
And I'm afraid I'm gonna end up
losing both of you.

590
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:34,389
I wanted so much to be like you,
Laura.

591
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:41,104
To have your strength
and your courage.

592
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,608
But look what it did.

593
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,155
Look what it did to you.

594
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,826
As much as I love you, Laura,

595
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:59,289
most of the time we were trying
to solve your problems.

596
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,083
And you know what?
We still are.

597
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,545
Not mine or James' or Maddy's.
Yours.

598
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:09,424
You're dead, Laura, but your problems
keep hanging around.

599
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,552
It's almost like they didn't bury you
deep enough!

600
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,018
James.

601
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,395
I'm looking for Donna.
I can't find her.

602
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,564
I just gotta talk to somebody.

603
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,399
What's wrong, James?

604
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,817
She came home.

605
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,319
Who?

606
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,323
My mom was all loaded.
She was all screwed up.

607
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,908
God, I hate her.

608
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,994
James, no.

609
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,330
God, you're on fire.

610
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,425
Hold me.

611
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,233
Oh, my God.

612
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:09,943
Donna.

613
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:23,206
Donna!

614
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,084
Why?!

615
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,553
All I did was come to a funeral.

616
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:43,601
And it's like I fell into a dream.

617
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:49,399
It's like people think

618
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,652
I'm Laura.

619
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,988
And I'm not.

620
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:59,242
- I'm nothing like Laura.
- It's so hard, I know.

621
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,869
I know, sweetheart.
I know.

622
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:06,457
All I know is that Laura
was my cousin,

623
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:10,545
and I loved her and she died.

624
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,506
I don't know anything else.

625
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:17,010
You just want life to be the way
it was before.

626
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,637
- Yeah.
- So do I.

627
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,973
We all do.

628
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,268
And try as we might,
it just won't cooperate, will it?

629
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,145
No.

630
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,025
Oh, baby.

631
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:36,112
If life could only be like
those summers up at...

632
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,947
...Pearl Lakes.

633
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,659
Leland?

634
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,290
The door was open.

635
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,084
Leland...

636
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,503
What is it?

637
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,178
Leland, you're under arrest
for the murder of Jacques Renault.

638
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,989
I'm sorry, I didn't know
where else to go.

639
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,825
Donna.
What's wrong?

640
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,746
I don't even know if I want to
talk about it, I feel so stupid.

641
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,207
Slow down.

642
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,417
Sit down.

643
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,212
I keep telling myself
that he's confused,

644
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,048
but how much longer
am I supposed to think that?

645
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,176
- James Hurley?
- Yeah.

646
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,512
Just when I thought I had it
all figured out.

647
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,014
Why do I even care?
Why should I?

648
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:48,976
Well, you care
because you care for him.

649
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:54,148
- Don't you?
- I wish I didn't. I just want it to stop.

650
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,858
First, you have to stop.

651
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,487
Hey, what was it she
used to say?

652
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:04,909
"Donna Madonna,
there's always mañana."

653
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,203
How did you know that?

654
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:19,257
- I'll get you something to drink, okay?
- Okay.
