1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,809
Honey mustard.

2
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,520
<i>Honest to God,
it's starting to drive me crazy.</i>

3
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,045
<i>- Don't.
- It keeps me awake.</i>

4
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,010
<i>I lay there thinking, "Where is it?
Where did it go?"</i>

5
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,204
<i>- And I just-- I can't even-- I have no idea.
- Jesse, look.</i>

6
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,931
<i>Doesn't it make sense
that it wound up in the lab?</i>

7
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,090
<i>I thought about that a lot.
But I just don't see how.</i>

8
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,687
<i>Well, look. You had the pack in
your pocket of your jacket, right?</i>

9
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,326
<i>- Yeah.
- And your jacket was in your locker.</i>

10
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,767
<i>So maybe the cigarette
fell out of the pocket...</i>

11
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,288
<i>and wound up in the locker,
and now it's all burned up.</i>

12
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,442
<i>- It's gone.
- Yeah.</i>

13
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,405
<i>But I don't know that, you know?</i>

14
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,728
<i>I can't ever know for sure.</i>

15
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,248
<i>Well, look, did you
check your house?</i>

16
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,841
<i>Did you--? Maybe it's
somewhere in your house.</i>

17
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,401
<i>No, man.
I've looked everywhere, okay?</i>

18
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,369
<i>- Your car? Did you check your car?
- No.</i>

19
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,091
<i>- Thoroughly?
- Yes, of course. It's not in my house.</i>

20
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,760
<i>It's not in my car.
The more I think about</i> it...

21
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,048
<i>...there's no way it
fell out in my locker.</i>

22
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,202
<i>Somebody's gonna find it
on the street.</i>

23
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,091
<i>- You don't know that.
- Somewhere where I dropped it.</i>

24
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,447
<i>Some innocent person,
some kid maybe, even.</i>

25
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,728
<i>They're gonna pick it up,
and it's gonna--</i>

26
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,366
<i>- You're working yourself all up.
- Oh, my God!</i>

27
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,841
<i>You've gotta get a hold
of yourself, here.</i>

28
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,686
<i>All right? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna come over there.</i>

29
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,844
<i>And together, we 're gonna look
for this thing. All right?</i>

30
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,047
<i>Yeah.</i>

31
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,569
What the hell is that?

32
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,768
My Roomba.

33
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,164
I already checked it.

34
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,564
When?

35
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,688
Like a week ago.

36
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,725
Oh, God.

37
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,844
Oh, Jesus.

38
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,644
Okay. Easy, easy. Take it--

39
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,526
Careful. Let me see.

40
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,843
Is it still intact?

41
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,124
Yeah. Good.

42
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,049
Good. No worries.

43
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,322
Let me get rid of this.

44
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,370
What luck.

45
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,091
Well, I don't know about you...

46
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,811
...but I, for one, could use a beer.

47
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,849
You have any?

48
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,330
Jesse?

49
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,327
I almost shot you.

50
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,806
Hey, hey, now...

51
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,043
I almost killed you all because...

52
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,084
Listen.

53
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,647
It was just a misunderstanding,
that's all.

54
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,882
No. No, no, no, no.

55
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,207
I don't know what's wrong
with me, Mr. White. I--

56
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,566
Hey.

57
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,887
- I don't know how I could be so stupid.
- Stop that now. Come on.

58
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,004
Come on. Come on.

59
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,406
I'm so sorry.

60
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,888
It's okay. It's okay.

61
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,484
Listen to me.

62
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,803
What happened, happened for
the best, you hear me?

63
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,162
And I wouldn't change a thing.

64
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,125
You and I working together...

65
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,687
...having each other's back.

66
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,408
It's what saved our lives.

67
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,804
I--

68
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,322
I want you to think about that
as we go forward.

69
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,127
Go forward where?

70
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,320
<i>Stillwell, steady as you go.</i>

71
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,966
<i>Willie, note the time.</i>

72
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,244
<i>Captain, I'm sorry,
but you're a sick man.</i>

73
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,609
<i>I'm relieving you as captain
of the ship under article 184.</i>

74
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,411
<i>- Oh, God.
- I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

75
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,881
<i>Helmsman, left 180.</i>

76
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,450
<i>Mr. Keith, what do I do?
You're the officer on the deck.</i>

77
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,331
<i>I told you to come left.
Now come left, and fast.</i>

78
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,962
<i>I'm sorry, sir, but you're not issuing
orders on this bridge anymore.</i>

79
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,246
<i>I've relieved you.</i>

80
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,925
<i>I take full responsibil--</i>

81
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,762
Thanks for seeing us.

82
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,161
<i>We're here to talk partnership.</i>

83
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,171
Partnership?

84
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,924
Yes. Equal. Three ways.

85
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,401
You, Jesse and me.

86
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,369
Partnership in what?

87
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,922
Well, we figure we're gonna start
cooking again.

88
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,003
You know, we figure, why not?

89
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,124
There's no denying the popularity
of our product.

90
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,203
There's a market to be filled...

91
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,249
...and currently no one to fill it.

92
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,970
A lot of money to be made.

93
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,727
And obviously, Jesse and I
have manufacture covered.

94
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,007
But there's still distribution...

95
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,130
...support, logistics,
that sort of thing.

96
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,762
For instance, we'll need a
steady supply of precursor.

97
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,321
With your experience
and connections...

98
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,165
...you would be a great help.

99
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,087
Granted, there's a
lot of work ahead.

100
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,810
There's a lot of rebuilding.

101
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,885
And, no doubt,
our profits will be smaller.

102
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,887
At least at first. But each of us
will receive a larger cut.

103
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,328
Owners, not employees.

104
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,562
Thanks, but no, thanks.

105
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,047
Mike, I know you don't care for me.

106
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,886
We've had our issues, you and I.

107
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,527
But I would suggest...

108
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,200
...that you leave emotion
out of this decision.

109
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,930
I am.

110
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,204
You...

111
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,489
...are trouble.

112
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,965
I'm sorry the kid here doesn't
see it, but I sure as hell do.

113
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,726
You are a time bomb...

114
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,724
...tick, tick, ticking...

115
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,842
...and I have no intention
of being around for the boom.

116
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,450
Well, sleep on it.

117
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,762
Maybe you'll reconsider.

118
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,481
In the meantime, we're pressing on.

119
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,324
Morning.

120
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,244
Hey, why aren't you upstairs?

121
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,529
- I came to see if you needed any help.
- Yeah, well, I don't.

122
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,001
Well, I can see that, man.
It's outstanding.

123
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,730
Yeah. I'm working on it, here.

124
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,968
Not exactly running marathons,
you know.

125
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,602
Yeah, well, when did your couch-shaped
ass ever run any marathons?

126
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,689
- I'm proud of you, brother.
- Yeah.

127
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,285
So how many Krauts we got?

128
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,965
Enough to invade Poland.

129
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,169
Came in their own G5,
just like Oprah has.

130
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,243
G5, yeah?

131
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,807
Is that one where the wings
go up like that?

132
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,486
- I think they all do that.
- They all have that?

133
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,086
Anyway, we got two U.S. Attorneys
in the house.

134
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,328
Big doings.
Your name keeps coming up.

135
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,642
Yeah? Hey, give me a hand here,
would you?

136
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,723
Just a little bit there. Thanks.

137
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,680
<i>I hired Peter Schuler in 1992.</i>

138
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,921
Almost single-handedly, he grew
our little restaurant division...

139
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,208
...into an industry leader...

140
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,285
...and a source
of great personal pride.

141
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,571
I am shocked and saddened
by his death...

142
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,603
...and outraged by the damage...

143
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,482
...his actions have wrought
upon my grandfather's company.

144
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,367
Alleged actions.

145
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,603
An innocent man does
not kill himself.

146
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,240
My people and I are here to help.

147
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,804
To your investigation, I pledge Madrigal's
full cooperation and transparency.

148
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,000
I confess I have my selfish reasons.

149
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,209
I believe Peter Schuler
was a lone anomaly.

150
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,251
But if that is not the case,
I want to know it...

151
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,482
...just as you do.

152
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,408
So when you gonna announce it?

153
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,409
I don't know.

154
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,689
As I'm walking out the door
with my big cardboard box.

155
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,367
Can't do that. You know damn well
we're gonna throw you a big party.

156
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,166
Damn straight.
We're talking a blowout.

157
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,891
Outstanding police work, Hank.

158
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,690
If only I'd listened.

159
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,405
But I guess the damage was done.

160
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,084
It's not right,
them putting this on you.

161
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,649
Somebody's gotta go under the bus.

162
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,644
Ramey's a good man.

163
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,808
He'll do right by you.

164
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,687
Besides, this office
practically runs itself.

165
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,808
Bullshit, it does.

166
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,205
Sir.

167
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,964
What's with that A.P.D. thing?
The electromagnets?

168
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,088
They're thinking
it's about Fring's laptop.

169
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,682
A couple of days before it happened,
desk sergeant gets a call...

170
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,002
...from a "postal inspector"
quote, unquote...

171
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,248
...wanting to know
where they keep the thing.

172
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,370
And he told them? Jesus.

173
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,329
Anything left of the laptop?

174
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,968
Do we look that lucky?

175
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,523
I sneaked a peek before A.P.D.
took it out of Fring's office.

176
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,163
The whole thing was encrypted. They
wouldn't have got anything anyway, but...

177
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,650
So Hector Salamanca killed Fring.

178
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,730
But who gave Salamanca
the bomb?

179
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,487
Whole lot of questions
and not much in the way of answers.

180
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,926
Yet.

181
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,085
The A.P.D. did find
some of Fring's financials.

182
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,760
That just might lead to something.

183
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,207
I had him out to my house.

184
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,406
Fourth of July.

185
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,642
We cooked out in the backyard.

186
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,965
My son shucked the corn.
My daughter cut up potatoes.

187
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,929
Fring brought sea bass.

188
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,166
Every time I grill it now, I make a little
foil pouch, just like he showed me.

189
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,927
That whole night,
we were laughing...

190
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,321
...telling stories, drinking wine.

191
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,689
And he's somebody else completely.

192
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,400
Right in front of me.

193
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,651
Right under my nose.

194
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,405
Hi. What can I get you?

195
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,848
- Just tea. Chamomile.
- Oh, sorry. We don't have chamomile tea.

196
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,526
Then some sort of bergamot,
not Earl Grey.

197
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,569
I like soy milk instead of dairy.

198
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,042
We don't have soy milk
or any sort of bergamot.

199
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,722
You're really running me
through my paces here.

200
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,201
Well, English breakfast, I guess.

201
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,805
We have Lipton's.

202
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,731
That's pretty much all we have.

203
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,410
I would like a cup of hot water, filtered,
if possible, and a slice of lemon.

204
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,483
I'm assuming
you don't have stevia?

205
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,970
Never mind. I brought my own.

206
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,891
You coming to me,
or am I coming to you?

207
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,850
Face forward. We'll talk like this.

208
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,402
I guess I'm coming to you.

209
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,804
Take a breath, will you?

210
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,890
This place is safe.
No one's gonna see you here.

211
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,766
My God. Duane,
this is so-- Thank you.

212
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,003
How did I not see you sitting
back there? So weird.

213
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,447
You want anything else, Mike?

214
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,565
No. I'm good, Fran. Thanks.

215
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,570
Now...

216
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,680
...how about
we lose the sunglasses?

217
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,844
I feel like I'm talking
to Jackie Onassis here.

218
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,681
There you go.

219
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,725
Breathe in, breathe out.

220
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,801
Drink your whatever.

221
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,409
Who killed Gus?

222
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,211
Haven't I told you
not to worry about that?

223
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,323
Now, what do you want from me,
and why is it so important?

224
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,966
What's this?

225
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,610
A list of 11 names.

226
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,364
Okay.

227
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,564
You know them all.

228
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,971
I do.

229
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,447
Those 11 men--
And I think you know this, Mike.

230
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,001
Those 11 could sink us,
you and me both.

231
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,006
- Where are we going with this?
- No specific... I'm just pointing out facts.

232
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,242
These men--
Your men, yours and Gus'...

233
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,721
...they were on the payroll,
very publicly.

234
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,605
They trace back to Pollos,
the laundry, to Madrigal.

235
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,451
They're gonna get picked up
by the police. When they do...

236
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,126
...and threatened,
and there's only one way out--

237
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,965
And I'm not saying
all of them, okay?

238
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,361
All it's gonna take is two or three,
or even one.

239
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,040
But there's always a weak link.
But they're gonna talk.

240
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,171
At least one's gonna talk about you,
me, and that's all it's gonna take.

241
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,250
These are the 11 I know of,
but I'd love your input.

242
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,641
I never met your
chemist, for instance.

243
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,531
I'd love your input.

244
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,163
You want me to kill
every man on that list?

245
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,601
That's a leap, what you just...

246
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,323
No, I didn't say that.

247
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,281
But if you think that'd be wise...

248
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,290
You're scared, aren't you?

249
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,206
Yeah.

250
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,081
You're very upset, which I'm gonna
factor into my response here.

251
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,525
These are my guys,
and they are solid.

252
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,047
- Understand?
- What about Chow at the warehouse?

253
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,368
Didn't you have to shoot him
through the hand?

254
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,411
- Think that didn't stick in his memory?
- What about Dennis at the laundry?

255
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,801
- They're sure to pick him up.
- They already have.

256
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,968
They picked him up last night.

257
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,882
My guys are solid.

258
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,124
I vetted them with great care...

259
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,124
...and Fring made sure
they were well compensated...

260
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,649
...in the event of a situation such as this.
They're paid to stand up to the heat...

261
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,441
...keep their mouths shut,
no matter what.

262
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,284
And they will.

263
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,320
I don't know what movies
you've been watching...

264
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,251
...but in the real world,
we don't kill 11 people...

265
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,046
...as some kind of
prophylactic measure.

266
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,885
Look at me...

267
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,327
...and say you understand.

268
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,964
I understand.

269
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,362
- I get it.
- So we're off that very silly idea?

270
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,811
Good.

271
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,723
Drink your hot water.

272
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,642
I gotta go.

273
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,370
Did you have enough?

274
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,090
Yeah. I'm good.

275
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,520
Okay.

276
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,886
Bye-bye.

277
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,121
- Bye.
- Bye.

278
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,248
Bye, big brother.

279
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,965
Say bye to Mom for me.

280
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,642
I will. Have a good day.

281
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,802
You too.

282
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,849
Skyler.

283
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,241
Hey.

284
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,244
The car wash opens in 15 minutes.

285
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,489
Mariano can open for me today.

286
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,883
Hey, how about you get up, huh?

287
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,890
Come on.

288
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,240
A shower will feel good.

289
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,682
Hey, Chow.

290
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,289
How you holding up?

291
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,164
Okay.

292
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,001
You know, they...

293
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,285
They talked to me.

294
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,883
You can't smoke in here, Chow.

295
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,440
<i>Thanks for coming down.</i>

296
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,166
Have a seat, Mr. Ehrmantraut.

297
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,800
Am I saying that right?

298
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,162
Close enough.

299
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,888
Once more, you're waiving your right
to have an attorney present?

300
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,371
Correct.

301
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,522
Could you state that
to the camera?

302
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,570
I'm waiving my right
to have an attorney present.

303
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,769
Okay, then.
We just have a few questions.

304
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,163
You're currently employed
by the Pollos Hermanos chain.

305
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,810
- Is that correct?
- Yes, I am.

306
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,287
- What do you do there?
- Corporate security.

307
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,522
- Corporate security.
- Yeah.

308
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,287
What's that?
Like guarding the special sauce?

309
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,602
I conduct employee
background checks.

310
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,371
I oversee loss prevention.

311
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,206
At a fast-food restaurant,
that's a full-time job?

312
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,523
We have 14 locations.
So, yes, it's a full-time job.

313
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,571
Yeah, well, if I were you,
I'd start sending out those résumés.

314
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,769
It says here
you're a private investigator?

315
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,890
- Where you licensed?
- New Mexico, Arizona, Utah.

316
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,929
Every state where we operate.

317
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,171
Colorado? You have some
restaurants there, right?

318
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,927
- Colorado doesn't require licensure.
- Licensed to carry a firearm?

319
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,771
- Concealed carry? Yes, I am.
- Which states?

320
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,810
It'd be quicker to mention
the states in which I'm not.

321
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,163
And if we pulled your CCPs,
everything would be in order?

322
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,210
I'm guessing you've already
done that, so you tell me.

323
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,560
You strike me as a former cop.

324
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,046
Am I right?

325
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,369
Where at?

326
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,204
- Philadelphia.
- Philly.

327
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,160
The City of Brotherly Love. Turns
out we know some folks there...

328
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,489
...and they told us that your tenure
as a police officer...

329
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,486
...ended somewhat dramatically?

330
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,925
- You wanna talk about that?
- Not particularly.

331
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,364
Yeah, me neither.

332
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,610
See, I'm more interested in why Gus
Fring decided to put a guy like you...

333
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,451
...in charge of his
corporate security.

334
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,400
I mean, given your history...

335
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,283
...doing background checks
on pimple-faced fry cooks.

336
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,169
Seems like overkill.

337
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,608
What else you do for Fring?

338
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,685
He must've needed help
running that drug empire of his, no?

339
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,887
Drug empire?
First I'm hearing about that.

340
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,929
I don't know anything about that.

341
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,289
We have a guy that could
put you in that underground lab...

342
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,048
...and he'll testify to it. So from
here on out, this can go hard or easy.

343
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,043
So what's it gonna be?

344
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,847
Forget your handcuffs?

345
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,647
I'm confused.
Am I under arrest here, or am I not?

346
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,721
You wanna state that
for the camera?

347
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,049
You are not under arrest, currently.

348
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,607
Agents, do you have
any more questions for me?

349
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,723
Because you've got me very stirred
up with all these false accusations.

350
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,571
If I'm not under arrest,
I'd prefer to leave.

351
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,329
Oh, well...

352
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,530
I suppose we could talk about
the $2 million...

353
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,963
...in your granddaughter's name.

354
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,920
Yeah. It seems Fring had all these
secret offshore accounts...

355
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,846
...that he would deposit money into.
Like, well, an even dozen of them.

356
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,561
And they're all in the names
of certain people on his payroll.

357
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,803
The manager of the laundry...

358
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,122
...a couple guys from
the Pollos distribution centre.

359
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,966
There was the owner of a chemical
warehouse, a bunch of others.

360
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,567
You know, guys that must've been
getting paid off the books.

361
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,489
Anyway, one of the names
was Kaylee Ehrmantraut.

362
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,081
Ten years old
and just cute as a button.

363
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,404
Yeah. Two million and change
we found on deposit for her.

364
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,170
Way more than anybody else.

365
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,767
Now, my partner here,
he took one look at that and said:

366
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,244
"Shit, man. This fifth-grade girl is the
muscle behind Fring's entire operation."

367
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,165
I said, "Whoa, whoa, hey, partner,
slow down there.

368
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,167
Maybe it was actually
her dear old granddaddy."

369
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,923
Impressive, no?
That... level of insight?

370
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,090
He's not impressed, Gomey.

371
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,767
Perhaps he's picturing
all that money going bye-bye.

372
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:14,121
Yeah, well, I mean, the government's
gonna take every last dollar, unless...

373
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,128
Here's the thing, Mike-- Or Michael?

374
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,362
- Mr. Ehrmantraut.
- Here's the thing, Mike.

375
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,210
Lucky, you didn't touch that money.

376
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,404
I cannot say the same
for the other 11 on the list.

377
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,608
One of your guys is gonna roll...

378
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,127
...and then we'll definitely
remember the handcuffs.

379
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,121
Now, before that day comes,
you can do yourself a solid.

380
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,041
You can tell us what you know...

381
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,441
...you can tell us
who's still out there...

382
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,930
...and if we like your story...

383
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,331
...good things can happen.

384
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,051
Kaylee might be able
to keep some of that money.

385
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,929
Maybe.

386
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,484
So what do you say?

387
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,521
I don't know anything
about any money.

388
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,521
I don't know what
you're talking about.

389
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,846
First order of business is to find a new place to cook.
Before anyone says it...

390
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,485
- ...no more RV's.
- I don't know.

391
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,440
- The crystal ship did pretty good for us.
- The "crystal ship"?

392
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,841
Yeah. That's what I called it.

393
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,527
Well, I'll admit, it held its own
as a starter lab...

394
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,087
...but it was too dark, too small...

395
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,210
...not to mention it could've
broken down at any moment.

396
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,682
Saul, find us someplace safe
from prying eyes.

397
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,047
Security against detection
is paramount.

398
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,364
But I don't wanna drive too far. No more
50-mile treks to some Indian reservation.

399
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,969
In town is trickier. I mean, you got
a lot more of your prying eyes.

400
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,886
If Gus can manage it,
then so can we.

401
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,964
Precursor. Where are we with that?

402
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,890
We're good on everything
except methylamine.

403
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,929
No surprise.

404
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,730
It's dry as hell out there.

405
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,247
What if we switched back
to a pseudo cook?

406
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,209
Absolutely out of the question.

407
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,286
Jesse, there is methylamine out there.
I know it.

408
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,044
Yeah, but what if there's not?

409
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,248
Because there isn't.

410
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,726
I mean, really.

411
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,211
There is.

412
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,611
Have faith.

413
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,445
Can I offer a thought?

414
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,922
Say a guy wins the lottery.

415
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,804
Ten million bucks.

416
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,804
The very next day,
what's the one thing he does not do?

417
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,526
He does not go buy another
lottery ticket, right?

418
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,480
He counts his lucky stars,
and he sails off into the sunset...

419
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,042
...which, seems to me,
and all due respect...

420
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,090
...some advice you two might take.

421
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,529
What lottery did I win, exactly?

422
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,882
Hey, you're alive.

423
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,930
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
that's the Irish sweepstakes.

424
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,481
I'm alive, and I'm broke.

425
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,645
Counting the money that I owe Jesse,
I'm about 40 grand in the hole.

426
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,929
Does that seem like an acceptable
stopping point to you?

427
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,807
There is gold in the streets...

428
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,009
...just waiting for someone
to come and scoop it up.

429
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,409
But me, I should quit now.
Jesse, too, I suppose, huh?

430
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,126
I got you this time, kid.

431
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,367
Hey, how come you get two,
and I only get one?

432
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,805
Oh, what are you gonna--?

433
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,291
That one's mine!

434
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,571
Green is beating orange.

435
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,200
- No.
- Green is beating orange.

436
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,847
Pink is beating your yellow one.

437
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,448
I give up. bah)'-

438
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,889
You're too good.

439
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,531
Yeah?

440
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,247
<i>It's me. You got a minute?</i>

441
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,324
Yeah. A minute. What's up, Chow?

442
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,529
The DEA,
they call me to come back.

443
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,125
Say they want to talk more.

444
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,691
<i>I'm sure they do.</i>

445
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,291
Did you call your lawyer?

446
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,683
<i>Yeah, but, Mike,
the DEA take all my money.</i>

447
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,001
<i>I need it.</i>

448
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,049
I need my money.

449
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,964
You understand.

450
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,327
<i>What do you want me
to do about it?</i>

451
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,965
I don't know.

452
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,203
I don't know. We gotta talk.

453
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,890
<i>Not on the phone.</i>

454
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,361
<i>Can you come to my house?</i>

455
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,521
All right.

456
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,842
<i>You give me two hours.</i>

457
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,571
Chris.

458
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,446
I'd like you to drop your gun
where you stand...

459
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,810
...and then turn around very slowly.

460
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,480
Come on over
and sit next to Chow.

461
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,287
How much was she gonna pay you?

462
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,127
Ten thousand a name.

463
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,571
How far did you get down the list?

464
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,729
Just Chow.

465
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,609
I figured I'd start with you.

466
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,926
For you, she was gonna pay 30.

467
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,561
I'm really sorry about this, Mike,
but I needed the money.

468
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,883
Those feds, they took it all, man.

469
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,885
I know.

470
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,248
Are you ready?

471
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,243
Listen, Mike--

472
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,323
Kiira, come and have some cookies.

473
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,007
- It's a cookie!
- It's a cookie, yes!

474
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,009
Let's go.

475
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,890
Let's count.

476
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,962
Well, look at this.
What are you doing?

477
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,811
- Hey, Mommy!
- What are you doing still up?

478
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,530
Hey, yourself. Give me a kiss.

479
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,763
- She said she wanted to wait for you.
- She does, huh?

480
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,924
Well, who's the adult here, Delores?

481
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,607
- Tell me she ate her dinner, at least.
- Oh, yes, she ate everything.

482
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,370
She ate her peas, her carrots.

483
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,603
Do whatever it takes to keep them
out of here, or they die.

484
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,325
- A whole lot.
- Understand?

485
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,404
- Yep.
- That's right, my girl.

486
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,041
Delores, I'm gonna take a bath. Put
Kiira to bed and then go on home.

487
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,884
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Really?

488
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,045
- You don't want me to wait for you?
- No, you go home. Thank you.

489
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,601
Si, Miss Lydia.

490
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,522
Mommy, you gonna come
say good night to me?

491
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,251
Yeah, honey.
After Mommy takes a bath.

492
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,164
Okay.

493
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,522
Love you.

494
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,529
Mommy's very tired,
so let's go to bed.

495
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,170
Don't hurt my daughter.

496
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,483
I won't have to unless you scream.

497
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,688
You know why I'm here?

498
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,404
What are you waiting for?

499
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,006
The nanny to leave.

500
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,641
If you have anything to say to me,
now's the time.

501
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,044
Two good men died because of you.

502
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,763
Don't shoot me in the face.

503
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,571
Please. I don't want my daughter
seeing me like that.

504
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,845
- Your daughter won't see you.
- She will. She'll find me.

505
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,686
- She never once sleeps through the night.
- Nobody's gonna find you.

506
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,489
Wait. What?

507
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,723
No. No. No.

508
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,326
No. She has to find me.

509
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,051
- Lower your voice.
- She has to find me.

510
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,321
She has to find me.

511
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,644
You want your 5-year-old daughter
stumbling across your dead body?

512
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,849
I can't disappear.
She has to know I didn't leave her.

513
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,202
- She has to know that.
- Keep your voice down.

514
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,600
I don't care what you do.

515
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,888
I'll scream, and
I'll keep screaming.

516
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,008
My daughter's not thinking
I abandoned her!

517
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,209
Shut up and calm down.

518
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,285
I don't care. You have to promise.
You have to promise me.

519
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,246
Promise I don't disappear.

520
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,929
Can you still get your hands
on methylamine?

521
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:08,129
Methylamine, Lydia.
Can you still get it?

522
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,170
Maybe.

523
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,251
Why?

524
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,401
<i>- Yes?
- You still plan to move forward?</i>

525
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,164
Yes, we do.

526
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,047
I've reconsidered.

527
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,850
I'm in

528
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,480
Good.

529
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,687
Well, you missed a good meal.

530
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,329
The lasagna came out very well,
if I do say so myself.

531
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,243
I wrapped some up for you
if you'd like some later.

532
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,167
You know, it gets easier.

533
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,281
I promise you that it does.

534
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,481
What you're feeling right now...

535
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,366
...about Ted...

536
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,488
Everything.

537
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,323
It'll pass.

538
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,082
When we do...

539
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,042
...what we do for good reasons...

540
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,965
...then we've got
nothing to worry about.

541
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,721
And there's no better reason...

542
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,283
...than family.
