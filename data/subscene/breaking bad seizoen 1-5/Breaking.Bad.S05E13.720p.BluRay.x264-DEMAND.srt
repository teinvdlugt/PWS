1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,435
How big's the batch?

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,831
Should be about
50 pounds, give or take.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,753
Uncle Jack, that mask,

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,912
I think you should...

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,715
Mr. White said the fumes
aren't good to breathe.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,758
Let me worry about
what I breathe, kid.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,800
Just hurry this up
so I can grab a smoke. Ahem.

8
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,600
Seventy-six percent.
Ha.

9
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,956
Nice going, nephew.
Thanks, Uncle Jack.

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,395
Where's the blue?

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,200
Where's the what?
The blue color.

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,920
Does it come later,
when this hardens?

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,116
Where is it?

14
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,829
I am correct in assuming
this should be blue?

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,879
See, I'm thinking the headline here
should be "76 percent."

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,997
Yeah. Whole lot more than it was.

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,880
That dude who looked like Wolverine?
He couldn't crack 70.

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,398
Fine. Yes, percentage-wise,
it's marginally improved.

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,040
And congratulations, Todd.

20
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,755
But blue is our brand,
all over Europe.

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,151
It's what our buyers pay
top dollar for.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,040
If we're down a bit in purity
from the Heisenberg days,

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,830
maybe they'll let us slide on that,
but not if it's not blue.

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,554
I don't know. To my eye,

25
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,394
it's kind of blue.
Yeah, a little.

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,711
It's bluish.

27
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,040
Todd, you're the chef.
What do you think?

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,320
Yeah, kind of.

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,239
If it catches the light just right,

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,310
I could see how you'd think
there's a touch of blue,

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,551
blue-green in there.

32
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,956
Aquamarine.

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,113
Hell, we'll put food coloring in it.
Make it any damn shade you want.

34
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,476
Yeah, like they do
farm-raised salmon. Yeah.

35
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,678
I mean, Jesus, you ever see
how pink they make that crap?

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,433
Like, flamingo pink.

37
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,279
It sure as hell don't come out
the ocean looking like that.

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,112
All right. Let's make some money.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,755
Here you go, Ms. Quayle.
Lydia.

40
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,752
Thank you.

41
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,071
Is the tea okay?
I made it just like you asked.

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,316
Mm-hm.

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,355
You sure? If it's too weak or something,
I can go put another bag in it.

44
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,239
I'm sure.

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,869
Look, about the product,

46
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,760
I'm really sorry
about the color.

47
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,719
For a minute or two,
it just got a few degrees too hot

48
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,473
in the mixing kettle, I think.

49
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,752
I might've just
cooked the color right out of it.

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,999
You burned it, like a cake.

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,111
Yeah, sort of, I guess.

52
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,118
But the point is I think I can fix it,

53
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,631
and I think I can bring
the purity up too.

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,795
I mean, I'm doing everything
just like Mr. White taught me, so...

55
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,351
You know,
it's bound to get better, right?

56
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,955
I appreciate you making
every possible effort

57
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,239
because, as you know, my buyers
expect a certain threshold,

58
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,629
a continuity.

59
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,071
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

60
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,070
About your buyers,

61
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,679
I could ask my uncle
to smooth things over with them,

62
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,112
if you want.

63
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,716
I'll pass. Thanks.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,515
I've put a lot of faith
in your abilities, Todd.

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,431
I believe in you.

66
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,115
Please do make the cook better.

67
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,034
It's very important to me.

68
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,509
I've got a flight to catch.

69
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,839
Hello.
<i>Hey. It's Walt.</i>

70
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,554
Hey, Mr. White. How you doing?

71
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,234
<i>I'm okay.</i>

72
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,039
<i>I, uh...</i>

73
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,991
<i>Todd, I think I might have
anotherjob for your uncle.</i>

74
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,914
Oh, okay. You want me to
set up a meeting?

75
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,312
<i>I-- Yes. Please. Let's do that.</i>

76
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,877
Any heads-up
I should give him, like

77
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,636
which jail, how many targets,
stuff like that?

78
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,233
Mr. White?
<i>Just one target.</i>

79
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,596
<i>Not currently in jail.</i>

80
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,152
<i>Jesse Pinkman.</i>

81
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,914
You got it.

82
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,518
I'm surprised you didn't strangle him.
So now what? Book him?

83
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,236
I'm sure the AUSA will have plenty to
say about how to play him against Walt.

84
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,359
Knowing what we know about
how Walt deals with rats behind bars?

85
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,358
Punk has to be safer
with the marshals

86
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,950
than out here
where it's open season.

87
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,120
What does that mean?
What are you thinking?

88
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,674
The kid's got an idea.

89
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,150
What kid? That kid?
Timmy Dipshit there?

90
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,471
The one that screwed up our sting?
I'm all ears.

91
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,235
Just hear him out,
would you?

92
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,317
Okay, genius, what's the idea?

93
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,315
You guys need evidence
to put him away.

94
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,995
Only he's too smart
to leave any out there, right?

95
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,674
So you say.

96
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,160
Well, I know some evidence

97
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,199
that greedy asshole
would never destroy.

98
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,118
His money.

99
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,636
You know where he keeps his money?
No.

100
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,555
But I know someone who might.

101
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,030
Oh, hey. How'd it go?

102
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,278
Trailed him to the Dog House,
picked him up there.

103
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,319
Seemed to be looking for someone.
Had a lot of questions.

104
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,670
No calls though, right?

105
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,514
You got his phone?
Yeah.

106
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,753
He's on ice?
Safe house off Rio Bravo.

107
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,957
We've got Van Oster
babysitting him.

108
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,192
Yeah. What about Van Oster?
Did he have any questions?

109
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,795
Probably, but he knows
better than to ask.

110
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,996
Good job.

111
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,231
I gotta tell you this
up front, Hank.

112
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,551
If this guy decides
he wants to lawyer up,

113
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,236
I don't care if you are my boss,
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

114
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,432
He won't lawyer up.

115
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,990
What the hell, man?

116
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,920
You're up.

117
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,950
Hey there. You mind
taking it outside for a minute?

118
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,356
No, sir. You got it.
All right, thanks.

119
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,671
Huell Babineaux.

120
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,519
Know who I am?

121
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,437
I'll take that as a yes.

122
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,478
Thanks for your patience.

123
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,357
Uh, as Agent Gomez said,
you're not under arrest.

124
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,435
Why am I here?

125
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,792
Well, you're here, um,
for your own protection, sir.

126
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,030
How you figure that?

127
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,989
Well, we both know how dangerous
my brother-in-law can be.

128
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,233
Nice poker face.

129
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,119
Look, uh, relax.

130
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,920
There's not much new you can
tell me about Walter White.

131
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,918
Multiple murders,

132
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,112
ties to a white-power
prison gang,

133
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,000
ran the largest meth racket
in the entire Southwest.

134
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,470
I'm not asking,
you're not answering,

135
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,677
whoop-de-do.
Let's cut to the chase.

136
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,872
We have a wire on Walt's phone.

137
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,671
We intercepted a call between him
and a certain Saul Goodman, Esq.

138
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,400
You know, your employer?

139
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,559
Anyway, in the call, Walt said
that he was going to, quote:

140
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,189
"Take care of one
Jesse Pinkman," unquote,

141
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,518
and that you were next on the hit list.
That's why you're here.

142
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,751
Bullshit. That don't make no sense.

143
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,310
I got the recording.
I can-- I can let you hear it.

144
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,915
Your associate, Goodman's fixer--
What's his name?

145
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,231
Some carrottop
named Patrick Kuby.

146
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,869
Boston P.D. ran him out
of Beantown a few years back.

147
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,514
Came out here
for the sunshine.

148
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,718
Walt said he was gonna do this
Kuby guy the same way he does you.

149
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,957
In fact, Kuby's already missing.

150
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,830
Sorry to say, things are looking grim
for your-- Your redheaded buddy.

151
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,198
Believe us, don't believe us.
Suit yourself.

152
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,795
Whatever you do,
I would not call Goodman.

153
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,838
He sold you
down the river bigtime.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,070
The hell you talking about?

155
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,509
Don't take it personally.

156
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,752
Goodman's next on the chopping block
if he doesn't do what White says.

157
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,596
To be fair, your circus clown of a boss
did try to spare you for all of, what,

158
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,558
about, uh, 15 seconds,

159
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,991
before he decided
to help Walt track you down.

160
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,914
You see, Goodman's got
a trace on your phone,

161
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,639
and as soon as you call him,

162
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,712
Walt will find out
where you're hiding.

163
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,157
Then it's just a matter of time
before you end up like this.

164
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,956
Oh, man. Oh, man. I swear to God,
I didn't know he was gonna kill him, man.

165
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,079
I didn't know he was gonna kill him.
Relax.

166
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,397
If we thought you did,
you'd be in lockup

167
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,473
for conspiracy to commit murder
instead of under our protection.

168
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,994
Tell us everything you know so we
can get him before he gets you.

169
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,992
Why would he wanna kill me?

170
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,311
I ain't do nothing.
Who knows with this guy?

171
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,477
From what he said,
it may have to do

172
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,839
with him tying up loose ends regarding
poisoning some kid named Brock.

173
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,080
Or maybe it's because
you know where his money is.

174
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,039
I don't know where his money is.

175
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,515
That ain't what we heard.

176
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,831
You ain't listening
to the people in the know.

177
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,957
Me and Kuby rented a van
for the dude,

178
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,834
loaded his cash up
in a self-storage unit,

179
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,555
handed over the keys to him
at Goodman's.

180
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,951
Who knows where he took it
from there?

181
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,760
A van, huh?
How much money we talking?

182
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,953
Seven barrels' worth.

183
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,474
Seven barrels?

184
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,115
When you say "barrels,"
you mean "barrels" barrels?

185
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,514
Barrels, man. You know,
plastic, black, 55-gallon type.

186
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,000
I got them at Home Depot.

187
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,675
Filled up every last damn
one of them too.

188
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,951
And, uh, where did you rent the van?

189
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,909
Lariat. The one
on Candelaria and Monroe.

190
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,719
Lariat on Candelaria?
Yeah.

191
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,191
Kuby rented the van.
Mr. White dropped it off.

192
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
He had us wash it good
before Kuby took it back.

193
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,355
Wash the rental? Why?

194
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,354
It was filthy, man,
like he went off-road with it.

195
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,479
After we had hosed it down,
he grabbed a shovel out the back,

196
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,354
handed over the key,
and that was it.

197
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,840
That's all I know.

198
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,669
All right, Mr. Babineaux.

199
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,034
Agent Gomez and I are going
to do everything we can

200
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,759
to find this son of a bitch.

201
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,400
Like I said,
you're free to go.

202
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,519
But if I were you,
I wouldn't take one step out that door.

203
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,191
And remember, no phone calls.

204
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,919
Oh, actually, I almost forgot.

205
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,157
Uh, I took the liberty
of removing the battery

206
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,551
so Walt can't track you by GPS.

207
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,519
So don't put that back in.

208
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,717
Agent Van Oster
will stay here with you.

209
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,230
You're in good hands.
He's our best man with a gun.

210
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,039
Uh, don't discuss the case with him
because the less you distract him,

211
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,431
the better he can protect you.

212
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,033
How long you gonna be?

213
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,429
As long as it takes to keep you safe.

214
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,916
So just one guy this time.

215
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,396
Not even in lockup.

216
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,279
Some former partner,
Todd says?

217
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,716
Yeah.

218
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,991
So, what are we talking, rat patrol?

219
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,958
Rat p--?

220
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,439
No, no.

221
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,917
Rat patrol?
No. No, he's not a rat.

222
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,157
He's just...

223
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,317
He just won't listen to reason.

224
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,599
Okay.
He's just angry.

225
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,353
He's not a rat.

226
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,519
All right.

227
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,831
Angry non-rat. Got it.

228
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,639
How angry we talking, by the way?

229
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,553
Like, Hulk angry?

230
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,919
Like, Rambo-James Bond
badass individual?

231
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,436
Not something
you'd do yourself, huh?

232
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,718
Jesse is like family to me.

233
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,758
Look, I want what you do
to be quick and painless.

234
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,832
No suffering, no fear.

235
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,993
Bullet to the back of the head.
Something he doesn't see coming.

236
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,949
I respect that.

237
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,397
There's too many savages out there.
Let's just talk about the money.

238
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,791
No, we don't want your money.

239
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,000
We want you to cook for us.

240
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,950
You know I'm out
of the business.

241
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,600
Just a couple times
to tutor my nephew here, that's all.

242
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,800
Get him on track
to bringing the purity up.

243
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,316
Get the color right too.

244
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,314
Apparently that blue touch
you put on it,

245
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,751
it's all the craze
with those Slavic types.

246
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,920
So I'm told.
No.

247
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,993
Absolutely not.

248
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,870
Look, what was the price per head
last time? I'll triple it.

249
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,431
A drop in the bucket compared to
what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.

250
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,116
Don't skimp on family,
that's what I always say.

251
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,680
You want us to do this job?

252
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,833
Do it right? That's the price.

253
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,673
One cook,

254
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,309
after the job is done.

255
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,797
Time is of the essence.
Do you understand?

256
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,191
Do him tonight if you want.

257
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,240
Just tell me where he is.

258
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,076
I don't know where he is,

259
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,280
but I know how to flush him out.

260
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,911
You want string cheese
or yogurt squeezers with your PBJ?

261
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,480
Both.

262
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,799
I didn't hear you.
Both, please.

263
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,758
Hold on, honey.

264
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,031
Hi, Andrea.
I don't know if you remember me.

265
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,152
I'm Walter White, Jesse's friend.

266
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,391
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. Hi.
Yeah. Yeah.

267
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,880
Oh, hi. Hi.

268
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,640
I'm sorry to just barge in
on you like this,

269
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,714
but, uh, I was hoping that I could
have a moment to talk with you.

270
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,274
It's about Jesse.

271
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,672
Um, sure. I'm sort of
rushing around right now.

272
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,837
Wanna talk inside
while I get my boy ready?

273
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,357
Oh, well, yeah. If it's--
If it's okay, yeah, sure.

274
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,678
Thank you.

275
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,756
You met Brock before, right?
Yes. Yes, I have. At Jesse's.

276
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,076
How you doing, Brock?

277
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,953
Brock, he asked you a question.

278
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,831
I'm good.
Good.

279
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,639
Froot Loops.

280
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,553
That's good stuff.

281
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,795
So Jesse...

282
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,314
Yeah, I...

283
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,755
I don't wanna alarm you,

284
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,480
but I've been trying
to reach him for days.

285
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,960
I've stopped at his house,

286
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,840
I've left all kinds of messages
on his voicemail,

287
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,152
and he won't return my calls.
I can't find him anywhere.

288
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,800
Have you heard from him?

289
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,555
No, not since the last time
he called to check on Brock.

290
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,114
That was, I don't know,

291
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,312
two weeks ago, maybe.

292
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,793
Andrea,

293
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,918
Jesse's using again, and I...

294
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,640
I have a bad feeling
about this.

295
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,356
Have you tried calling the police?

296
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,680
Or a better idea.

297
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,072
Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman.
I have his card somewhere.

298
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,790
I mean, he may have ways of finding
Jesse without getting him in trouble.

299
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,198
"Better call Saul."
Yeah. I-- I did that.

300
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,670
He was able to verify
that Jesse's not locked up,

301
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,033
but, otherwise, very little help.

302
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,193
You see, the thing is,

303
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,478
is that Jesse and I
had this argument recently.

304
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,914
And I won't bore you
with the details, but he's...

305
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,757
He's-- He's pretty upset
with me and, um...

306
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,674
And I'm hoping that's the reason
he hasn't called me back

307
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,720
instead of him being...

308
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,517
Well...

309
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,078
Well, I'll try him right now.

310
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,233
I mean, if that's it,
he's mad at you,

311
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,189
maybe I'll have better luck.
That would be such a help. Yes.

312
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,319
What--? What--? What number
are you calling him on?

313
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,269
His cell.
You know, he recently got a new one.

314
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,272
And there. That--

315
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,000
That's his new number there,
the highlighted one.

316
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,710
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.

317
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,271
Your friend Walter just dropped by.
He's here at the house right now.

318
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,637
We-- We're thinking of you.

319
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,996
Call me back as soon
as you get this message.

320
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,680
I really need to hear from you.

321
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,877
It's important.

322
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,759
Thank you, Andrea.

323
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,072
I appreciate that.

324
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,998
Well, I better--
I better be going.

325
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,073
You're welcome to stay a few minutes
to see if he calls back.

326
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,835
No, no, no. You're trying to get
your son off to school.

327
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,515
If he does happen to call back,
would you call me?

328
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,316
Better yet, I've got your number.
I'll call you back, okay?

329
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,359
And thank you.

330
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,799
See you, Brock.

331
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,070
We on?

332
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,880
Yes. It should be any time now.

333
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,599
<i>Copy that.</i>

334
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,310
Remember, fast and painless.
And take him away from here.

335
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,319
I don't want the mother
or the boy to know.

336
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,352
<i>You got it.</i>

337
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,872
<i>Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.</i>

338
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,920
<i>Your friend Walterjust dropped by.
He's here at the house right now.</i>

339
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,157
<i>We-- We're thinking of you.</i>

340
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,437
<i>Call me back as soon
as you get this message.</i>

341
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,159
<i>I really need to hear from you.</i>

342
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,993
<i>It's important.</i>

343
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,789
Nice try, asshole.

344
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,679
How'd it go at the rental place?
Van have GPS?

345
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,752
No GPS. Nope.

346
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,709
They used to have GPS
until about six months ago

347
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,270
when the ACLU or somebody
sued them

348
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,272
and they had to get rid of it.

349
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,271
Well, that's it.
Game over.

350
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,319
Yo, man, you can't just
give up on this.

351
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,756
Who said we're giving up?
What do you got?

352
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,071
Just thinking about
what Babineaux said

353
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,152
about the van being dirty

354
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,232
and the shovel
that Walt had with him.

355
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,672
I'll bet you 10-to-1
he buried that money.

356
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,991
No kidding. So what?

357
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,278
There's a whole lot of desert out there.
How we gonna find the spot?

358
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,676
You said it yourself,
there's no GPS on the van.

359
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,356
Yeah. But Walt
doesn't know that.

360
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,199
All right.

361
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,554
Here's your change.

362
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,837
Oh, count it out, please.
Here.

363
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,838
Uh, three. That makes 15.

364
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,635
Plus 5, that is 20.

365
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,992
Give this to your car wash professional.
Thank you.

366
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,480
Say it.

367
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,838
Have an A-1 day.
Oh, you too.

368
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,637
Good.
Why--? Why do I--?

369
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,837
Who do I gotta say that?

370
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,037
Because it reinforces our brand.

371
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,192
So getting the hang of it?

372
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,558
It's, uh-- It's pretty basic.

373
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,398
Mom, it's Saturday.

374
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,960
Can--? Can I go?

375
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,715
Go where?
Home.

376
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,349
Pick up a few things,
maybe chill for a little bit.

377
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,433
I'm sure the smell
is gone by now.

378
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,240
Why don't you just stick around here
for a while longer?

379
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,357
I need you.
Hi.

380
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,910
Uh, who do I give this to?
Um...

381
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,834
You know what? I'll take care of it.
Excuse me, son.

382
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,435
That'll be 14.97, please.

383
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,550
Hey. How you doing?

384
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,314
You're on our billboard. You're--

385
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,080
You're the lawyer guy, yeah.
"Better call Saul!"

386
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,040
Heh, heh.

387
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,514
Okay.

388
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,391
So 3 makes 15, and 20, 25, 30,

389
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,076
35, 40, and 10 makes 50.
Thank you.

390
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,720
I like your commercial.

391
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,519
What--? What happened
to your face?

392
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,559
Oh, this is a-- I guess you'd call it
an occupational hazard.

393
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,554
Thank you, and please give that
to your car wash professional.

394
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,996
Very good. Thank you very much.
Good to meet you.

395
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,674
Yeah.
Don't drink and drive.

396
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,190
Okay.
But if you do, call me.

397
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,159
Ahem.
Have an A-1 day.

398
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,471
Mom, you forgot to say it.

399
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,195
Yeah. Yeah, I did. Okay.

400
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,314
Make sure you get in there
between the cushions, all right?

401
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,672
That's it. Way in there. Attaboy.

402
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,199
What the hell you doing here?

403
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,234
I swear to God, the kid left
so much booger powder in there

404
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,198
my Caddy is a K-9 unit's wet dream.

405
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,829
Is your phone broken?
All 200 of them?

406
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,152
Huell's gone.

407
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,754
Huell's gone where?

408
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,596
No idea. AWOL. Nobody's seen him.
He's not answering his phone.

409
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,672
So, what about Jesse?

410
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,997
He hasn't shown up yet.

411
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,595
He will, Saul.
He's probably high as a kite

412
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,553
and hasn't gotten our message yet.

413
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,229
Or he got it loud and clear,
figured out it's a setup.

414
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,199
The kid is not as dumb
as you think.

415
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,954
Are you wearing
a bulletproof vest?

416
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,840
Did you miss the part about
my bodyguard has gone missing?

417
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,792
Look, I had him
watching the Dog House,

418
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,553
figuring the kid might show up.

419
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,712
Next thing I know, radio silence.

420
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,349
You're the math whiz.
Add up two and two.

421
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,274
Jesse is not on some killing spree.

422
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,671
It's me he wants.

423
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,194
It's just me.

424
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,033
Well, then where the hell's Huell?

425
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,198
Any news?
Not yet, but soon. I promise.

426
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,671
Have an A-1 day.

427
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,437
Next,

428
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,640
inventory lists.

429
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,597
These are the inventory lists.
Every day, after close of business,

430
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,673
you tally the total
of every item sold

431
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,036
and you mark it
under the appropriate column.

432
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,399
So say we sold, I don't know,
10 pine-scented air fresheners.

433
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,711
You mark "10" under this column

434
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,196
and then you subtract 10
from the stock column.

435
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,113
Okay? Why don't you try that?

436
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,840
Jesse?

437
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,195
<i>Got my photo, bitch?</i>

438
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,198
<i>That barrel look familiar?</i>

439
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,438
<i>Because I just found six more
exactly like it.</i>

440
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,277
<i>That big bastard who
works for Goodman,</i>

441
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,671
<i>I pistol-whipped that melon
he calls a head</i>

442
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,958
<i>till he gave up what he knew,
which led me to your rental van,</i>

443
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,874
<i>which, it turns out, had GPS.</i>

444
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,192
<i>How do you like that, genius?
Guess you didn't think of everything.</i>

445
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,558
Look, Jesse, I don't know
what you plan on doing here, but--

446
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,320
<i>Well, I'll give you a hint, Walt.</i>

447
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,599
<i>It involves a couple of five-gallon cans
of gasoline and a lighter.</i>

448
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,831
No, no, no! Jesse, please, listen to me.

449
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,559
<i>No, you listen to me, bitch.</i>

450
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,110
<i>You get your ass out here
as fast as you can.</i>

451
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,919
Yes, I'm coming. Okay! Okay!

452
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,630
<i>And don't even think about
calling anyone for help, all right?</i>

453
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,917
<i>You hang up on me, put me on hold,</i>

454
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,878
<i>lose my call for any reason,</i>

455
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,760
<i>as soon as you do,
I'm burning all of it.</i>

456
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,674
<i>All right? One big bonfire.
You get the picture?</i>

457
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,514
I get it, I get it. Okay.
<i>All right. You better hurry,</i>

458
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,797
<i>because I'm burning
10 grand a minute</i>

459
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,912
<i>till you get here, starting right now.</i>

460
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,879
I said, I'm coming!
Don't you touch my money!

461
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,272
<i>Fire in the hole, bitch.
There goes 10 G's.</i>

462
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,911
<i>Oh, nice orange flames.</i>
No, no, no!

463
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,000
Jesse-- Jesse, please.

464
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,119
I'm dying. My cancer is back.

465
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,671
You're not hurting anyone
but my family. Okay?

466
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,877
I can't spend this money.

467
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,112
It's not for me. I won't be around
long enough to use it.

468
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,800
It belongs to my children.

469
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,634
<i>Oh, you're gonna talk about kids.</i>

470
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,598
<i>You're seriously gonna go there?</i>

471
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,909
I am sorry about Brock.

472
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,434
<i>No, you're not.</i>

473
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,478
I am.
<i>You're not, but you're gonna be.</i>

474
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,519
Yes, I am sorry about Brock!

475
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,319
But he's alive, isn't he?

476
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,392
He's fine, just as I planned it!

477
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,115
Don't you think I knew
exactly how much to give him?

478
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,317
That I had it all measured out?
Come on!

479
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,911
Don't you know me by now?
<i>I know you're a lying, evil scumbag,</i>

480
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,150
<i>that's what I know.</i>

481
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,391
<i>Manipulating people,</i>

482
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,116
<i>messing with their heads.</i>
Open your eyes!

483
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,996
Can't you see that I needed you
on my side to kill Gus?

484
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,192
I ran over those gangbangers!

485
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,273
I killed Emilio and Krazy-8! Why?

486
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,875
I did all of those things
to try to save your life

487
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,560
as much as mine.

488
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,791
Only you're too stupid to know it!

489
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,039
Jesse.

490
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,557
Jesse!

491
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,280
Jesse, talk to me.

492
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,394
Jesse!

493
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,280
Jesse, I didn't hang up! Jesse!

494
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,399
Jesse?

495
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,310
Jesse, I'm here. Where are you?

496
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,795
Son of a bitch.

497
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,917
Son of a bitch.

498
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,712
Son of a bitch!

499
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,397
No. No. No, no, no.

500
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,075
Come on, come on.

501
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,799
Yes.

502
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,956
Yeah?

503
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,077
It's me. I've got Jesse in sight,

504
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,919
and he's coming for me right now.

505
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,153
<i>He knows I'm alone.</i>

506
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,231
Let's go, boy.
<i>I'm guessing he's got backup.</i>

507
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,279
How many guys?
<i>I do-- I-- I don't know.</i>

508
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,319
Where are you?
<i>To'hajiilee.</i>

509
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,437
<i>An Indian reservation west of town.</i>

510
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,990
<i>Get a pen.</i>
Go.

511
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,040
Okay.

512
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,760
Okay.

513
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,072
"Thirty-four, 59, 20,

514
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,392
<i>106, 36, 52."</i>

515
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,829
Those are coordinates.

516
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,671
<i>If you want me around
to cook for you,</i>

517
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,399
you get here now.
<i>You got it.</i>

518
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,916
As fast as you can. Okay. Wait.

519
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,594
They're coming.

520
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,312
Looks like there could be
three men total.

521
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,789
Wait a minute.

522
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,071
What? What is it?

523
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,833
- Stay in the car.
- Oh, my God.

524
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,277
<i>Walter, what is it?</i>

525
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,437
<i>Walter, you still there?</i>

526
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,393
<i>Walter?</i>

527
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,555
<i>Walter, you got eyes on him?</i>

528
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,637
<i>What do you see?</i>

529
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,392
<i>Walter, talk to me.</i>

530
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,919
Forget it.

531
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,718
Don't come.

532
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,400
What do you mean,
"don't come"?

533
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,710
<i>It's off.</i>

534
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,391
Do not come.

535
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,319
Walt!

536
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,958
Come on out!

537
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,519
Walt!

538
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,072
Walt!

539
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,751
I know you're out here!

540
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,991
It's over!

541
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,237
Walt!

542
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,196
Come on out, Walt!

543
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,959
Got him.

544
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,558
Drop it!

545
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,393
Hands up!

546
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,034
Walk towards me slowly!

547
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,319
Stop.

548
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,713
Turn around.

549
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,800
Lace your fingers
behind your head.

550
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,717
Walk backwards to me.

551
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,200
Stop.

552
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,599
Get on your knees.

553
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,080
How'd you like my
barrel photo, huh?

554
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,550
Took it in the backyard
by the barbecue grill.

555
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,475
You know, where we used
to cook out with the family.

556
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,436
Gomey thought the dirt
might not match. But me?

557
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,671
I bet your greedy ass
would be so worked up

558
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,832
about the prospect
of losing your cash

559
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,032
that you wouldn't catch it.

560
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,112
Looks like I was right.

561
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,237
He's clean.

562
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,831
Yo, I remember this place.

563
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,391
It's the very first place
we cooked, like, ever.

564
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,319
It is, isn't it?

565
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,791
Hey, what say you save us
the busywork, Walt,

566
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,759
and point out the spot
where you buried your money?

567
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,040
No?

568
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,314
No matter.

569
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,712
I'll get a search team out here.
We'll find it.

570
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,120
Agent Gomez, should we flip
a coin for the honors?

571
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,920
No way, man. It's all yours.

572
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,234
Walter White,

573
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,631
you have the right to remain silent.

574
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,309
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

575
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,960
in a court of law.

576
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,918
You have the right
to speak to an attorney

577
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,833
and have an attorney present
during questioning.

578
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,719
If you cannot afford an attorney,

579
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,634
one will be provided for you
at the government's expense.

580
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,840
Do you understand these rights
as I have just recited them to you?

581
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,799
Coward.

582
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,000
- Get-- Get over here!
- Bring it!

583
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,994
Get in the truck, will you?
Bring it, bitch!

584
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,992
Put him in the car!
Come on! Come on!

585
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,391
Get in the car! Hurry up!

586
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,152
Get in the car, kid. Come on.

587
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,709
Gonna take him down
for booking, okay?

588
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,156
You should stay here
till I come back with a search team.

589
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,313
You got it.
I'd take the kid with me,

590
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,439
but they'd probably
kill each other on the way.

591
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,434
Congratulations, buddy.
Hey.

592
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,589
I'll call the tribal police,
let them know we're here.

593
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,397
Gonna make a phone call.

594
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,358
Hank, why is there what looks like
brains in our garbage can?

595
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,196
Hey, baby. I got him.

596
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,396
Dead to rights.

597
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,400
You got Walt?
<i>Yeah.</i>

598
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,155
<i>I got him in handcuffs as we speak.</i>

599
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,751
<i>Want me to wave to him for you?</i>

600
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,759
Heh, heh. Well, he's not--

601
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,752
He's not feeling too friendly.

602
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,710
Oh, my God.

603
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,792
You did it.

604
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,872
Thank God.

605
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,919
Things are gonna be a little rough
for the next couple weeks,

606
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,400
but they'll get better.

607
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,834
Baby, you okay?

608
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,676
I'm much better now.

609
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,759
I gotta go.

610
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,318
It may be a while
before I get home.

611
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,193
I love you.

612
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,511
I love you too.

613
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,556
Who the hell is this?

614
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,712
Tribal police?

615
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,317
Hank! Hank! Hank!

616
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,676
No--

617
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,875
Police! Drop your weapons!

618
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,230
Jack, don't do it!

619
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,840
Jack!

620
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,639
Drop your weapons!

621
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,797
You heard the man! Put them down!

622
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,156
How do we know you're cops?

623
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,432
Show us some ID!

624
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,034
Damn straight!
Let's see some badges!

625
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,994
Jack!

626
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,832
Jack, don't do it!

627
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,520
Jack!

628
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,556
No, Jack, it's off! Jack!

629
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,670
We'll give ourselves up,
you show us some badges!

630
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,358
Simple as that!

631
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,799
How about it?

632
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,675
No!

633
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,311
Jack!

634
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,279
Jack, it's off! Forget it!

635
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,553
Jack!
