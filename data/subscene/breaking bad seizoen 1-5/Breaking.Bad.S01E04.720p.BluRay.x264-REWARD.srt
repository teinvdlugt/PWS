1
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:07,131
Operation Icebreaker.

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,637
How we liking that? We never
used that before, did we?

3
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:14,222
Isn't that the name
of a breath mint?

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,556
What?
Ice Breakers, right?

5
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,059
- Breath mint?
- Nobody's gonna think that.

6
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,519
Gonna be thinking about
some big-ass ship

7
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,062
in the North Pole
breaking ice.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,232
Says you. I'm gonna be thinking
Operation Breath Mint.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,817
I'm thinking
Operation Breath Mint

10
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,236
every time you and me are on a
stakeout together, all right?

11
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:31,239
Your breath can knock a buzzard
off a shit wagon.

12
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:35,618
All right, Operation TBD.

13
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:36,911
Thanks for nothing, Gom.

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,499
Anyway, say hello to
Domingo Gallardo Molina.

15
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,753
A.k.a. Krazy-8. Way smarter
than your average cheese eater.

16
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,380
I turned him out
when he was street level,

17
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,257
but this dude's
like The Jeffersons,

18
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:50,425
moving on up.

19
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,968
Every small-time dealer
he'd throw at us,

20
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,720
he'd end up snaking
all their customers.

21
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,431
Now it turns out that he's
missing, presumed dead.

22
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,474
Found his car
out in the boonies.

23
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:02,770
Last guy he ratted out
was none other than his cousin,

24
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,231
Emilio Koyama.

25
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,442
You thinking the cousin
found out and took revenge?

26
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,111
Could be. Turns
out he's missing too.

27
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:13,698
And normally I'd say
someone did the world a favor.

28
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:17,785
But our snitch's car, turns out
we find two grams of meth in it,

29
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,996
we take it to the lab,
they come back,

30
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,957
they tell us it is the purest
they've ever seen.

31
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,626
Ninety-nine-point-one percent.

32
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,212
I mean, our chemist is blown away. Said
he couldn't do the same thing better.

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,757
Worse yet, it didn't come out
of some super lab in Mexico,

34
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,093
we're thinking this was cooked right
here in the Land of Enchantment.

35
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,764
Car was abandoned at
what appears to be a cook site.

36
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,975
This is the, uh,
only other thing left behind.

37
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,435
We're sending it off
to Quantico,

38
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,103
see if they can pull
something off it.

39
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,355
Meantime, our guys swabbed
the filter element

40
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,358
and found the same 99.1 meth.

41
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,862
So be on notice.

42
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,073
We got new players in town.

43
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,786
Now, we don't know who they are,
or where they come from,

44
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,413
but they possess
an extremely high skill set.

45
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,333
Me, personally,

46
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:09,170
I'm thinking Albuquerque
just might have a new kingpin.

47
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,290
Jesus, Walt, you're burning
the shit out of them.

48
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,709
Oh. Damn it.

49
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,295
Hey, Sky,
you got any more chicken?

50
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,464
Emeril here
is gonna need a fresh pack.

51
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,424
Bam.

52
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,884
All right, looking good.

53
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,804
Is this low-fat mayonnaise
in the coleslaw?

54
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:03,140
Uh, I... I don't know,
it's store-bought.

55
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,934
Okay, uh, Hank,

56
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,143
you need another beer?

57
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,854
Does the pope
shit in his hat?

58
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,064
Yeah, I don't think
that he does, Hank,

59
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,774
and I think everybody
would like it

60
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,359
if you'd stop saying that.

61
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,777
Marie, some more wine, maybe?

62
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:15,945
I'm all right, thanks.

63
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,738
All right.
Hey, I want a beer.

64
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,033
Yeah, I want Shania Twain
to give me a tuggy.

65
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,119
Guess what.
It ain't happening either.

66
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,620
How about some more soda, hm?

67
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:25,872
Yeah, sure.

68
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,039
Honey, do you need anything?

69
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,666
Mm-mm. No, Walt,
thank you.

70
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,210
Okay. Be right back.

71
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,689
No.

72
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,774
What, are you
kidding me?

73
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,277
You look like
a damn movie star, man.

74
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,946
Girls gotta be lining up
left and right.

75
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,656
Tell him how
good-looking he is.

76
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:01,949
He's adorable.

77
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,952
He doesn't wanna be fricking
adorable, he wants to be hot.

78
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,622
Anyway, see what I'm talking about?
That's female perspective.

79
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,457
She's supposed to say that.

80
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,876
Look, a guy doesn't
gotta look like, uh,

81
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:15,796
you know, Charlton Heston...
I'm talking Moses days.

82
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,423
- To get a girl, all right?

83
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,469
You just gotta have confidence.

84
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,305
Confidence and, uh...
And persistence.

85
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,807
Okay? That's what
I'm talking about.

86
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,477
I chased your aunt Marie here
all over creation.

87
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,396
I kept bugging her for a date,
she kept saying no.

88
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,231
What, I asked you,
like, 50 times?

89
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,318
Yeah, it was before they
tightened the stalking laws.

90
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:43,324
Anyway, how about your dad here?
That there's a good story, Walt.

91
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,992
Tell him how you met Skyler.
Uh-huh.

92
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,661
Mom was a waitress

93
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:52,625
in Los Alamos, and Dad said
that thing to you.

94
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,419
Well, actually, your mother
wasn't a waitress,

95
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:59,840
it was a summer job,
and, um, she was the hostess

96
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,593
and she also worked
the cash register.

97
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,720
And I used to
go in there a lot

98
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,472
because it was close enough
to the lab

99
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,475
where I could ride my bicycle.

100
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,186
And once I noticed her,

101
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,982
it got to be so that
I would only go in

102
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,775
when I knew she was working.

103
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:21,028
When it was slow, she would
lean against the counter,

104
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:25,700
doing her crossword puzzles,
uh, but kind of hiding it.

105
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,035
Right? Pretending that
she was still working,

106
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,289
and once I caught on to that,
I would do crossword puzzles

107
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,500
while I ate
my grilled-cheese sandwich.

108
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,546
It got so that every day
at lunch, we would both be doing

109
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,090
The New York Times
crossword puzzle

110
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,552
10 feet from each other.

111
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,971
And, uh... Heh-heh.

112
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,393
Eventually, I caught her
looking over at me,

113
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,520
so I began saying:

114
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,190
"Excuse me, um, 14 across,

115
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,401
seven-letter word
for whatchamacallit,

116
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,361
uh, may I ask what?

117
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,238
What you wrote down?"

118
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:08,576
And, uh, well,
that got us talking,

119
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,077
and, uh, boy,
I tell you, I was...

120
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,079
I was terrible
at those puzzles.

121
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:17,084
I don't think that I finished
even one of them.

122
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,463
But your mother
would do them in ink.

123
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,756
Very smooth.

124
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,718
I bet you didn't think
your old man had it in him, huh?

125
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,428
But that's what
I'm talking about,

126
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,055
that's persistence, you see?

127
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,307
Once you set your cap
for something

128
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:34,602
or somebody,
you gotta just, you know...

129
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,564
Whoa. Skyler.

130
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,108
Mom, a... Are you all right?

131
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,277
Hey, hey.

132
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,488
Shh. Honey, it's okay.

133
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,448
What's the matter?

134
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,620
What is it?

135
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,748
Ask him.

136
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,301
What's she talking about?

137
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,474
Walt?

138
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,478
Um...

139
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:24,193
I have cancer.

140
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,073
Lung cancer.

141
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,668
It's bad.

142
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,066
Ask him how long he's known.

143
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,028
I guess a month, maybe.

144
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,864
Oh, for God sakes, Walt.

145
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,740
We're just sitting out there
having a cookout

146
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,950
like nothing's going on.

147
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,870
He made me promise
not to tell anybody.

148
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,582
Christ,
these last 48 hours.

149
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,709
And it's the weekend,

150
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,795
so I couldn't even get
his doctor on the phone.

151
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,423
Buddy, why? I mean, why
wouldn't you wanna tell anybody?

152
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,509
Walt, don't you see

153
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,429
everybody just wants
to help you.

154
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:37,683
We're family. We get through
these things together.

155
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,644
And I don't get,
you know, lung cancer?

156
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,856
How can that happen?
You don't even smoke.

157
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,568
You know, I'm thinking that
this goes back 20 years, maybe,

158
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,195
to the applications lab,

159
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,280
all those chemicals
they had you working around.

160
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,574
We... We always took
the proper precautions.

161
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,910
One time you complained
that they didn't give you

162
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,745
the right kind of, um,
I don't know,

163
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,789
some kind of ventilation hood
or something, and... And...

164
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,584
And then the headaches.
Honey, it wasn't that.

165
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,170
How do they think they
can get away with this?

166
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,796
We should hire
a lawyer.

167
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,259
Okay, so first
let's deal with this.

168
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:16,430
Okay, so,
what's the next step for Walt?

169
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,600
Certainly
a second opinion, right?

170
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,394
Right. Right, absolutely.

171
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,941
Okay, so first thing tomorrow,
I talk to my radiologists,

172
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:33,280
we find you the best,
the oncology dream team.

173
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,366
That's good.
That's good.

174
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,202
Yeah.

175
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,289
Yeah?

176
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,624
Yeah, okay.
Okay.

177
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:44,833
Yeah.

178
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,758
I'm gonna go
check on Walt Jr.

179
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,136
I, um... I'm gonna see

180
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,932
if I can talk him into,
I don't know, joining us.

181
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,270
I really didn't mean for him
to find out that way.

182
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,319
Walt, uh...

183
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,990
whatever happens...

184
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:22,329
I hope this goes without saying,
but, um, whatever happens,

185
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,874
I want you to know that, um,

186
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,503
I'll always take care
of your family.

187
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,345
Yeah.

188
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,325
Yo, check out
these, uh, fake Pop-Tarts.

189
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,202
These are mad tight, yo.
No, thanks, man, pass.

190
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,165
Your loss. These are from, like,
Canada, or something. Imported.

191
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,417
Hey, yo, what happened
to your hallway, man?

192
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,210
Did, like,
the ceiling fall down, or?

193
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,213
Oh, yeah, uh, no, man,

194
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,799
I think the house
is just settling.

195
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,177
You know, it's been
caving in left and right.

196
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,262
Hit me in the eye. Heh-heh.

197
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,555
It's bananas.

198
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,057
Yo, my pops could fix you up,

199
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,559
he's, like, a contractor
or something.

200
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,687
Yeah? Yeah, right on,
I should grab that number.

201
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,065
Say, Jesse,
you still cook a little crystal?

202
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:38,906
Uh, could be, yeah.
You know, from time to time.

203
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,909
I heard you
lost your partner.

204
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,410
Emilio.

205
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,581
- Didn't he get locked up?
- No, man, uh, he's out.

206
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:48,999
His cousin bailed him out.

207
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,584
I think he skipped town
or something.

208
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,629
I don't know about any of that,
I've just been

209
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,090
kind of doing my own thing
these days, so...

210
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,842
But you maybe got
some crystal, man?

211
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,512
Because I could seriously go for a bowl
right now, you know what I'm saying,

212
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,846
take the edge off.

213
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,599
Hell, yeah,
Sunday night bowl, yo.

214
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,267
All right.

215
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:13,816
Well, uh, maybe it
just so happens that, uh,

216
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,611
I just recently cooked
the best batch ever.

217
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,114
Yeah?

218
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,908
Oh, yeah. Came up
with this whole new recipe.

219
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,160
It's more like a formula.

220
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,706
It's, like,
way, way more chemically...

221
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,793
Shit, you know, it's...
It's just the bomb, so...

222
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:37,047
But, you know, I don't know,
I've been thinking lately

223
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,216
I'll just lay off of it
for a while,

224
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,469
because lately it's been kind of
making me paranoid, so...

225
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,686
You know, for, like,
health-wise, just lay off.

226
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,604
Yo, if you're, uh,
not into sharing, man,

227
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,107
just tell us to piss off,
it's cool.

228
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,317
We don't need no soap opera.

229
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,820
Yeah, man, whatever.
No, no, it's all good, you know.

230
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:04,158
L-I'm just saying, uh, hey,
I got... I got plenty of pot.

231
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,618
Yeah, I think I'll bounce, man.

232
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,996
Yeah, sounds about right.

233
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:13,500
Hey, yo, yo.
Hey, homes, I'm joking.

234
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,670
Okay, I'm totally joking
with you.

235
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,423
You kidding? Sit down.

236
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,765
Best scante ever.

237
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,058
Grab that pipe.

238
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,235
Okay, there.

239
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,077
Shit.

240
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,716
Walt, do you need some help?

241
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,928
Oh, no, I'm... I'm fine, honey.

242
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,723
I'm fine. Just, uh, privacy.

243
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,850
Thanks.

244
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,563
I'm right
outside if you need me.

245
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,065
Okay.

246
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,366
Yeah, any time on Friday
is absolutely fine.

247
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,285
Thank you so much
for working us in.

248
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:22,416
Uh, can I just put that
on a credit card?

249
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,710
Great. Perfect.

250
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:29,965
Okay, so we will see you
at 10:45 on Friday morning.

251
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,759
Thank you so much.

252
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,469
Okay.

253
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,473
Oh, yes.

254
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,102
Honey, the best oncologist,

255
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,729
I mean, not even
just in New Mexico,

256
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,982
but one of the top 10
in the entire nation,

257
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,444
his name is, um, Dr. Delcavoli

258
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,696
and we see him on Friday.

259
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,615
Ah.

260
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,826
I mean, Marie really
came through for us.

261
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,120
She had her boss call, and...

262
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:07,335
Okay, this is good.

263
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,296
From here on out, I mean,
things are gonna...

264
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,840
What's? What's that we're
putting on a credit card?

265
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,469
Uh, it's just a deposit
kind of thing.

266
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,762
How much of a deposit?

267
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,765
It's $5000.

268
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,558
Five thousand?

269
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,854
Jesus.

270
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,858
What's that, just to start?

271
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:33,153
I mean, just to tell me
what I already know?

272
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,822
Walt, he's not in our HMO, okay?

273
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,825
So be it,
we'll figure it out.

274
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,747
Come on,
don't get hung up on money here.

275
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,749
I mean, we can
always borrow from Hank.

276
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,501
Absolutely not.

277
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,671
No, I just...

278
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,006
We're not gonna do that.

279
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,176
Well, maybe we can ask your mom.

280
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,639
Have you even called her yet?

281
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,520
Walt, regardless, you're gonna
have to tell her about this.

282
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:10,023
I'm willing to do it, but I...
I'll call. I'll call.

283
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,859
Okay, look,

284
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:16,822
I don't even want us
thinking about money.

285
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,032
Money is not
the issue here.

286
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,785
It's not.
I know. I know.

287
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,413
It's not.

288
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,040
Okay.
Okay.

289
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,417
Okay.

290
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,045
I'll take care of the deposit.

291
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,214
Yeah?

292
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,882
Yeah.

293
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,717
I'll, uh...

294
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,595
I'll borrow it from my pension.

295
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,502
Oh, damn it!

296
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,756
Hey. Heh-heh.

297
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,800
Hey, pal, what's up?

298
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:24,306
Oh, uh, yeah, no,
I thought I heard mice.

299
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,726
Heh. Boy, that's...
That's all we need, huh?

300
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,396
So, what's up, pal?

301
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,608
What the hell's wrong
with you?

302
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,777
What?

303
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,281
You're... You're acting all...

304
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,617
You're... You...

305
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:49,247
You're all...
Why are you acting so weird?

306
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,457
Son.
You're...

307
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,168
You're acting like
nothing is going on.

308
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,432
Oh, no, please.
Please, please, no.

309
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,443
Hey, no, hey!

310
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,821
- Hey!
- Put that douche bag

311
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,823
- on the phone.
- Oh, come on.

312
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,117
Hey, am I? Am I gonna
have to come down there

313
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,702
and whup your ass?

314
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,091
And let me tell you
something else,

315
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,343
I'm not doing this
for charity, right?

316
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,180
I'm hands down the best he's got in that office.
He knows it, I know it,

317
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,433
I expect to be paid
to a level commensurate with...

318
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,770
I said, "Dave, do you think
40 grand is a proper bonus?"

319
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:20,065
That's less than 10 percent of what I
booked for you guys this quarter. Come on.

320
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,400
I'm not gonna sit here
and be disrespect...

321
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,736
Oh, he's shitting bricks.

322
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,279
Oh, you know he is.

323
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,948
Yeah, that man lives in fear
I'll go across town...

324
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,450
Hell, I could go anywhere.

325
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:33,161
Hoffman, Gordon Bradley,
or Sorcher.

326
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,288
Even Goldberg-Wayne. They'd make
me a partner at Goldberg-Wayne

327
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,664
just for walking
in the damn door,

328
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,957
that's how ecstatic they'd be.

329
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,209
Next customer.

330
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,587
Hells, yes, brother man.

331
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,423
Dude, you
should check this chick out.

332
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:49,928
Who? No.
Buddy, she's a cow.

333
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,930
Stacey's a cow.

334
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:55,141
We're talking major
barnyard boo-hog.

335
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,060
Roll her in flour
and look for the wet spot

336
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,479
before you hit that, man,
you know what I'm saying?

337
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,273
That kind of stink
does not wash off.

338
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,984
- Sir?
Ha-ha-ha. Right.

339
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,570
Sir.

340
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:08,863
Oh, yeah?

341
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,573
- Sorry. Hi.
- Yeah. Oh, totally.

342
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,325
Hi. What can
I do for you today?

343
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:13,493
Which dude?

344
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,829
- Dude that looks like a lizard?
- Next in line.

345
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,872
- I, um...
- He limps like some leper.

346
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,958
I... I'm sorry.
I... I would like...

347
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,167
Grosses me out.

348
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,461
A cashier's check
in the full amount,

349
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:28,591
made out to Oncology Partners
of New Mexico, please.

350
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:33,555
Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y.

351
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,141
Yeah, you got it.

352
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,060
I don't understand why

353
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,771
they're forcing you to choose
between the piccolo and the oboe.

354
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,815
You show so much promise
with both.

355
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,317
They say they can't have any
switching between woodwinds.

356
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,862
Because no matter how they divide
it up, someone would be left out.

357
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,822
Well, rules are rules, I guess.

358
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,782
Sure, rules are rules.
I'm all for that.

359
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,369
But I'm telling you,
you really shine on that oboe.

360
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,746
You have real talent,
and I'm not just saying that.

361
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,707
Thanks.

362
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,375
What about Mr. Pemberton?

363
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,836
Is he giving you
enough individual attention?

364
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,297
I'd have to say so. He tries
to talk to each one of us

365
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,132
at least once
during every practice.

366
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,718
That's good.
Feedback's important.

367
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:14,012
It's key, I think.

368
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,973
Hey, so how was
soccer practice?

369
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,437
I think that was
in our backyard.

370
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,739
Who's there?

371
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,248
What the hell are you doing
out here?

372
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,085
Hey, Dad.

373
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,005
Hey, Mom.

374
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,007
Jake.

375
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:54,344
Got new patio furniture.

376
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,138
Right on.

377
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,142
Hey. Heh-heh. My leg.

378
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,918
What do you think it could be?

379
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,547
God knows I'm no expert.

380
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:16,384
I don't know. Uppers, downers?
Your guess is as good as mine.

381
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:20,972
I think we should check
his arms for needle marks.

382
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,851
Do we let him stay?

383
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:29,063
The Presbyterian Church
has those meetings.

384
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:33,026
So maybe on condition, you know?
If he agrees to attend.

385
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,904
I... I just don't know
what to tell Jake.

386
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:45,455
Hey.

387
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,624
Hey. Good evening.

388
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,210
Well?
Sleep well?

389
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,837
What time's, uh?

390
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,506
What time is dinner?

391
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,717
In about an hour.

392
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,015
You know, I could, uh, wash
those clothes if you like.

393
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,225
They look a little lived in.

394
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:10,855
Oh, um, no, that's cool.
Yeah, maybe later.

395
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,153
We are not doing this again.

396
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,113
Adam...
No.

397
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,450
We said we'd lay down the law,
we lay down the law.

398
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,703
We just have to be
consistent about it.

399
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,334
Hey.

400
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,586
You're, uh...

401
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,880
You're not taking the bus?

402
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,092
Oh.

403
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,343
All right. Well, listen.

404
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,304
Um, give me
maybe another 20 minutes,

405
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,098
and we'll get out of here.

406
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:31,144
All right.

407
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,770
Yeah, good.

408
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:07,513
You know, I...
I just think that, uh...

409
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:13,978
things have a way
of working themselves out.

410
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,669
Wow.

411
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,963
When did you, uh?
When did you get this?

412
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,382
Last May
at the year-end assembly.

413
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,427
They gave me that one too.
The one on the end.

414
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:51,432
Environmental
Consciousness Award.

415
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,478
What's that mean? What, you,
like, recycle cans and shit?

416
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,438
I contacted
The Albuquerque Journal

417
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,441
and asked what kind of chemicals
they use to bleach their paper.

418
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,068
They wound up writing
an article about it.

419
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:03,736
Right on, little bro.

420
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:06,739
Making mad inroads
with the business community.

421
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,533
All right.

422
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,535
Now, hey, remember,

423
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,413
not all learning
comes out of books.

424
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,002
Look at you. Heh.

425
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,089
You know, we should... We
should hang out more often.

426
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:27,552
You know, just, uh...
Just kick back and chill.

427
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:32,807
I mean, if you ever, like,
I don't know, need advice.

428
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,225
Because, you know,
I've been...

429
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,103
I've been through it all.
For real.

430
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:43,859
Yeah, man, you, uh?
You play the flute?

431
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,445
It's a piccolo, actually.

432
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,947
Dude, play some, uh...
Play some Jethro Tull.

433
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,996
Hey, guys,
how we doing in here?

434
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,331
We're, uh... We're good.

435
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,084
Jake?

436
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,627
Yeah. Fine, Mom.

437
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:06,382
Well, that's good.
That's... That's great.

438
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:18,311
You know, what the hell?
You see this?

439
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,313
What am I,
some criminal or something?

440
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,315
Whatever.

441
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,983
Whatever?

442
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,444
What, you?
You think that's okay?

443
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,863
Like, "Oh, we can't
let that scumbag

444
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:32,116
warp the mind
of our favorite son."

445
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,826
I'm the favorite?

446
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,746
Yeah, right.

447
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,206
You're practically
all they ever talk about.

448
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,557
Oh, snap.

449
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,727
Awesome.

450
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,677
Yeah?

451
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,053
Yo, man, it's me.

452
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,932
Hey, listen. You know that,
uh? That product?

453
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,893
You got any more of that?

454
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,145
No, man, okay?
I'm done giving out freebies.

455
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,647
You want charity,
go ask the Salvation Army.

456
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,649
No, no charity. No.

457
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,152
I got this cousin,
he's got him some rich friends.

458
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,113
These dudes are in town,
they're looking to party.

459
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,825
And your stuff is, like,
so sweet.

460
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,244
So, what do you say?

461
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,288
You up for making
some fat stacks?

462
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,208
Because they'll buy
everything you got.

463
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:40,387
Yes. Yes. Okay.

464
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,437
Oh, you can't be serious.

465
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,607
What the hell
are you doing here?

466
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,651
Yo, I waited
till the ball buster left.

467
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,445
I mean, no offense.

468
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,990
Who sent you, huh? Huh?

469
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,534
You wearing a wire?
Hey. Jesus.

470
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,785
You setting me up?

471
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,496
Homo. A wire? You want a wire?

472
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,457
I got a wire.
Speak into the mike, bitch.

473
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,167
What the hell's wrong
with you?

474
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,211
A wire.

475
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,754
Jesus.

476
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,508
So who did you tell
about?

477
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:18,884
Nobody. What, are you nuts?

478
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,053
Then why are you here?

479
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,557
I don't know.

480
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:28,060
To, like, touch base.

481
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,895
Touch base?

482
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,023
Yeah, you know, um,

483
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,861
what they call a debrief.

484
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,779
Maybe we could, like...

485
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,739
Thought we could debrief.

486
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,033
Debrief?

487
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,785
Wow, that's...

488
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,247
That's what you think
we need, debrief?

489
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,750
Yeah, after what happened,

490
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,420
it just seems
like the thing to do.

491
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,589
Kind of, you know,
talk about it.

492
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,758
I mean, we can't...
We can't talk to anybody else.

493
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,888
Anyway, th...
That and I wanted to, uh...

494
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,222
Wanted to, you know,

495
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,393
tell you how much everybody digs
that meth we cooked.

496
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,689
Everybody digs the meth
we cooked.

497
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:18,611
Seriously. I got dudes
that would give their left nut

498
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,070
for a little more.

499
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,739
Oh. Great.

500
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,950
I'm just saying,
I mean, if you ever,

501
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:29,163
you know, saw your way clear
to, um, you know,

502
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:34,043
you and I cooking
a little more...

503
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,298
Wow.

504
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,802
Get the hell off my property.

505
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,805
What? I'm just saying.
Go. And don't come back.

506
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,891
Now.

507
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:54,730
All right.
All right, you know what?

508
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,650
Four grand.

509
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:01,487
Your share
from selling that batch.

510
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:04,490
That's why I'm here.

511
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:09,578
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Hey, I didn't smoke it all.

512
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,730
Non-small-cell adenocarcinoma.

513
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,357
Stage 3A,

514
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,694
which means it's spread from
the lung to the lymph nodes.

515
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,738
There's no denying
it's very serious.

516
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,533
But it... Is it?

517
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:50,160
It is...

518
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,704
curable?

519
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:55,207
I prefer the word
"treatable."

520
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,084
But the treatments we have
at our disposal

521
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,335
can be very effective.

522
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,212
Without making any promises,

523
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,880
I can tell you
that the specific course

524
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,675
of radiation and chemotherapy
I'm going to suggest

525
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,176
has been successful.

526
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,345
In certain cases,
it's prolonged a patient's life

527
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,807
and even resulted
in remission.

528
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:15,060
Hmm. Um, what about
the side effects?

529
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:18,772
Well, they can be mild
to practically non-existent.

530
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,358
Or they can be
pretty darn awful.

531
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,901
It varies from patient
to patient.

532
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,695
Typically,
there's hair loss,

533
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:28,741
which begins a couple of weeks
after the start of chemotherapy.

534
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,202
You may find yourself unusually
fatigued, not much energy.

535
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,246
You won't want to
get out of bed.

536
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,290
You may lose weight
due to reduced appetite

537
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,459
and certain
intestinal issues.

538
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,588
Muscle aches and pains,
gums will get sore and bleed.

539
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:45,883
And, uh, of course, there's
the possibility of nausea,

540
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,135
although we'll prescribe
an antiemetic

541
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,511
and try to counteract that.

542
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,722
Possible kidney
or bladder irritation.

543
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,391
You may wind up with increased
bruising and bleeding.

544
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,438
There are maybe sexual symptoms.
Your skin may become dry...

545
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,595
Got anything to say?

546
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,019
What do you know about that?

547
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,688
Nothing.

548
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,315
Well, that's not
gonna fly this time.

549
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:46,151
How many chances
have we given you?

550
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,737
How many times
have we sat right here

551
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,906
and had the same conversation
over and over again?

552
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,617
Where you look us in the eye
and you plead ignorance?

553
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,369
And you play on our emotions

554
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:57,996
and you tell us
anything and everything

555
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,833
you think we wanna hear, just so
we'll give you another chance.

556
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,461
Mm-hm.
And it makes us feel like fools.

557
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,004
Every time.

558
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,511
Enough, Jesse.

559
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,846
Enough.

560
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,933
We are not going
to have this in our house.

561
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,895
We need you to leave.

562
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,353
Thanks for not telling on me.

563
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:11,236
Uh, you think
I could have it back?

564
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,461
It's skunk-weed anyway.

565
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,938
While 3 percent
are listed as unknown.

566
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,690
The Air Force is aware
of the widely-held belief

567
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,360
that some of these
could be flying saucers from...

568
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,779
You know,
this is actually very hopeful.

569
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:55,739
Nothing conclusive
in the evidence,

570
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,617
but probing and digesting
of information about UFOs

571
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,285
continues unceasingly.

572
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,287
Did you hear me?

573
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:06,083
I said this is really
very, very hopeful.

574
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,584
Oh.

575
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,962
Defense Command in Colorado
Springs issued an order...

576
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,922
So can I
call them and?

577
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,300
And tell them
you'll start next week?

578
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:16,760
Uh...

579
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,388
Even as they did so,
the military wondered whether

580
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,140
their scientific know-how
and their best weapons

581
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,642
would be effective
in any battle

582
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:29,523
of the Earth
versus the flying saucers.

583
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:33,318
I just think that
we need to discuss it

584
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:34,653
a little more, that's all.

585
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:37,281
What is there to discuss?

586
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,993
You're gonna get the best
treatment, and he's the best.

587
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,036
Well, there's the money
discussion. I think...

588
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:46,790
No, $90,000 out of pocket.

589
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,959
- Maybe more.
- There's a way, Walt.

590
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:52,879
There's financing,
there's, um, installment plans.

591
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,048
I... I could always go back
to work.

592
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,134
Walt, there's always a way.

593
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,427
All right.

594
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,638
Skyler, say that there is a way.

595
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,808
And we spend
all that money, and...

596
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:20,866
Am I supposed to leave you
with all that debt?

597
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,075
No.

598
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,119
Honey.

599
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:27,706
I just don't want
emotions ruling us.

600
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:31,209
Maybe treatment
isn't the way to go.

601
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:33,754
Then why don't you just

602
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,922
fucking die, already?

603
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:41,428
Just give up and die.

604
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:33,355
Come on, move your ass.

605
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,942
Uh, name of the guy?
You'll like him.

606
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:39,653
Yeah, dude, I'm not worried.

607
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:42,114
I got the best
fricking attorney.

608
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,783
I would not want to be
on the other side of this one.

609
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,160
He's got this little team
of ninjas, too,

610
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,121
that go out and do forward
operations...

611
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,581
He's got crap on people.

612
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:05,697
What the hell?

613
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,368
What?

614
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,953
Don't go near it, buddy.

615
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,039
What? What are you doing?
Call somebody.

616
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:15,540
Call the fire people.

617
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,584
Yeah. I have a fire...

618
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:20,545
I don't believe this. Do you
know how much I paid for that?

619
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,677
Why are you doing this?
