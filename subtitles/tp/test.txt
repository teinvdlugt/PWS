about Windom Earle's work with Project Blue Book.
My security clearance was revoked shortly after my disappearance.
And your ability to access these Blue Book files?
Now, the issue is not one of access.
However, there are certain moral judgments I must consider.
Yes, sir, I understand.
Will this information help you to prevent future loss of life?
Most assuredly.
Is this a copy of the petroglyph you found in Owl Cave?
Andy?
Sir.
Are you familiar with this?
Well, I've dreamed it.
Or seen it somewhere, somehow.
I will do what you ask.
Leo Johnson's arrest report. Good work, Hawk.
Gentlemen, the damage to Leo Johnson
would alter certain handwriting characteristics.
However, the basic style would remain the same.
This poem,
sent by Windom Earle, was transcribed by Leo Johnson.
Mr. Horne.
Mr. Horne, as you are no doubt aware, there are but scant hours
until our wine-tasting benefit begins
and I can't find your daughter anywhere.
Hmm. Audrey is in Seattle for the day.
However, I'm sure that our concierge will, uh, be able to assist you.
The concierge. Mm.
Heh, yes, capital.
Thank you, Mr. Horne. Mm-hm.
Oh, uh, Mr., uh...
Richard Tremayne. Tremayne, yes, right.
Men's fashions. Men's fashions, of course.
Tell me, um,
how is your, uh, nose?
Oh, Mr. Horne, think nothing of it.
A nose is a small price to pay in the service of a greater good.
Uh-huh.
Well, we will, of course, pay, uh, any medical expenses.
How kind.
One might also think workers' compensation
in some variety will be involved.
Easily done.
Capital, Mr. Horne.
I'll alert my attorney.
"I will alert my attorney."
Sometimes the urge to do bad
is nearly overpowering.
Drink up, my friend. We celebrate.
Celebrate? I can barely move my arms. Heh.
You have lived your short life in odium and obscurity.
But now, at the last,
you will step upon the larger stage.
I must confess, I envy you.
Your journey begins at a point beyond imagining.
Who knows where it might travel from there, huh?
I'm pumped.
Hey, is this for, like, the Lilac Parade or what?
Uh, no, uh, not a parade, my friend, not exactly.
Well, I'm real cool about helping out and everything, but, um,
how do I get out of this thing? Heh.
You don't.
Leo?
Fetch me an arrow.
Arrow?
Whoa, man. Heh.
I do not appreciate practical jokes.
Leo, the arrow?
No.
Jeez, don't zap the geek.
How am I supposed to get my beer without...? You know.
Dude. That hurts.
Fetch me the arrow.
Thank you, Leo.
What's with the arrow, man?
What are you doing?
This isn't funny. Shh, shh.
Be still. Well, what the hell are you doing?
Think of all the hapless sinners
wondering where their souls' destination lies.
For what?
To gain the answer to a simple question.
Where will my spirit awake?
What life am I given after this life?
This grave question has plagued man's sorry conscience for eons.
And now, you, you lucky boy.
You have the answer.
Now.
Miss Twin Peaks Judging and Rules Committee is now in session.
You know, this year is going to be very exciting.
Now we... Very exciting.
This year is going to be very, very exciting.
Thank you, Dwayne.
Now, first order of business.
Mr. Ben Horne has asked to address the committee
as a friend of the committee.
I don't have any objection to that.
Address away, Ben.
Thank you.
And, Dwayne, uh, let me congratulate you on your, uh, recent engagement.
Oh. Thank you very much.
She's a lovely woman and I wish you much happiness.
Well, thank you very much.
Ahem. Gentlemen.
My purpose is simple.
The age of the ogling, swim-suited jiggle festivals of the past is dead.
Miss Twin Peaks, I believe, and rightly,
is now a celebration of the totality of a woman's qualities.
Beauty has taken on a broader definition
to include mind, spirit, values, ideas.
And for taking this step, gentlemen,
I applaud you.
What's he selling? What are you selling?
Mr. Mayor, let me get right to the point.
Miss Twin Peaks is an event in search of a theme.
Now, what I propose is simple.
The topic of this year's speeches should be how to save our forests.
Hmm?
It's now, it's relevant, it's global and it's, um...
Well, to put it plainly, gentlemen, it's us.
Of course, uh, your opposition to the Ghostwood development plans
wouldn't have anything to do with this?
Pete, I resent your implication.
The environmental issues here dwarf any parochial business concerns
that I, or you, or anyone else
might be pursuing.
We'll, uh, take it under advisement.
Ahem. We'll take it under advisement.
That's the most that I could hope for.
Gentlemen, thank you for your time. Mr. Mayor.
He thinks he can pull a fast one.
The idea has merit.
I'm in favor of it myself.
Ahem. Bobby. Hey, chief.
Don't forget the dry-cleaning, all right?
Heh. Thanks.
Uh, will the first candidate please approach the committee?
Lana? Come on up, honey.
Uh, does anybody smell a fix here?
I can't do this, Bobby.
I have never made a speech before in my life.
I read a book report in the fourth grade in front of Mrs. Gardner's class
and I passed out right in front of the whole room.
You'll do great, doll. I'm gonna be your speech writer.
Oh. Heh.
You're gonna be great. Don't worry, okay?
Here you go. Good luck. Donna? Are you entering too?
Uh, yeah, you too? Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Isn't it exciting? Ha, ha. Yes.
Yes.
Mike, it's a long time no see.
I'd ask where you've been keeping yourself but I think I know.
This is very scary, Mike. It's not what you think.
It's not what I think? What do you think I think?
You think I'm going out with an older woman.
I think I don't know where you got this sudden interest in the life of fossils.
Yeah, but...
It's not what you think.
Mike, big favor.
Clear this up for me.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
I will strive to be understanding.
Do you have any idea
what a combination of sexual maturity
and superhuman strength can result in?
Whoa!
Sorry. Whoa.
Catherine, if there's anything you can tell me about her, anything...
Anything at all that might help me understand.
For instance?
What made her do the things she did?
What was she after?
Hmm. I've been asking myself a lot of the same things.
Catherine?
I need to understand.
I think that early in her life, she must have learned the lesson
that she could survive by being what other people wanted to see,
by showing them that.
And whatever was left of her private self,
she may never have shown to anyone.
So all the stories, the lies were...? Well, who knows?
They may not have seemed untrue to her.
What she needed to believe was always shifting to suit the moment.
In spite of all the things she tried to do to me and my family,
I find it curiously hard to hate her for it.
Well, she was...
She was so very beautiful.
Hmm.
There may be a clue that could benefit both of us.
What's that?
Thomas Eckhardt left this to me when he died.
It occurred to me that it might have something to do with Josie.
What's inside?
I don't know. I haven't been able to open it.
Let me see.
Well, there's no lid, there's... No.
There's no clasp.
Wowee, Bob.
Have we got some beauties in the contest this year.
Hello, Harry.
Seems like every gal in town is lined up to take a shot at the...
Say, have you had any luck with this thing?
Oh! Butterfingers.
Holy moly.
What is it?
Give it to me. Just a second, poodle.
Ah!
Now, I held it just so.
I used to swim here every summer. Two or three times a week.
Then I made a good choice. It's beautiful.
I always felt closer to nature than I did to people.
Why? I never had many friends.
Norma was always Miss Popularity.
She was always moving toward the world.
And I was always moving away from it.
Lived in my head, mostly. That's not a bad neighborhood.
There's some pretty strange neighbors.
Many boyfriends? No.
Really?
Well, I had one.
High school?
Senior year.
Have anything to do with why you went into the convent?
I'm sorry, do you mind if we don't talk about it?
Not at all. We can talk about whatever you'd like.
I wanna come back to the world.
I was so frightened for so long.
I understand.
Hiding from your fear doesn't make your fear go away.
Makes it stronger.
So I had to face it. I had to face myself.
And I had to do it here. Where everything went so wrong.
Annie, I know how hopeless things can seem.
I know about the dark tunnel you can fall into.
It happened before I went away.
It happened because of that boy.
Something similar happened to me.
It made me wanna disappear from the world.
Because of that, maybe I can help you.
I don't know you very well. No.
I'm trying to learn how to trust my instincts.
What are they saying?
Trust.
Good evening. Evening, all.
And welcome to our oenophiliac soiree.
Another in a continuing series of public events,
sponsored by Horne Industries,
to benefit the Stop Ghostwood Development movement.
Ono-what?
Something to do with wine. And now,
to the tasting.
Lana, Lucy,
if you'd like to help me pour, please.
Our first wines this evening are reds.
There are some schools of thought who, of course, say,
there are no other wines but reds. Heh.
Yes, Andy?
There are also white wines and sparkling wines.
Thank you, Andy.
And now that we're all poured, let us first examine...
Don't taste it yet, Andy, for heaven's sake.
Spit it out.
Sorry.
That's all right.
That's what we're here for, to learn.
Now, to the wine.
We must first examine the nose of the wine
to see what it can tell us about its bouquet.
And we do that by...
By smelling.
Very good, Lana.
Hmph.
Lift the glass, thusly.
And while rolling the wine vigorously around in the glass,
we breathe deeply and fully.
Very good.
And now, we take our first taste, a big, boisterous gulp.
And we roll it around our entire palate.
And we try to reach
those little taste buds stuck way far at the back of the tongue,
remembering not to swallow.
Excellent.
And now, we spit.
So he came slowly out of the shadows, leaving the dead girl behind.
And I said, "You take one more step and I will ventilate you."
And then what happened?
It was a brief, but touching funeral.
Dale, glad I caught up with you.
Got the rental fired up outside and about ready to hit the road.
Gordon, super we caught you before you left.
You hurry back. I will, Coop.
Remember Annie? Of course I do.
This world of Twin Peaks seems to be filled with beautiful women.
Although only one I can hear.
Join us for pie.
Love to.
Annie? Thanks.
Three each.
Shelly, do you mind if we share? No.
Coop, they say that love makes the world go around.
Makes people who need people the luckiest people in the world.
Although they never said a doggoned thing about a cure for hearing loss.
Shelly, you are a miracle worker.
And a goddess sent from heaven.
I'm a waitress in a diner.
I've never been compared to a goddess before.
Well, Shelly, you just don't know your own value.
Coop, she's a rare and precious individual, don't you think?
I know what you mean, Gordon.
Shelly, turn around and face me a moment before I lose my nerve.
I'm about ready to leave Twin Peaks,
and I don't know when I'm gonna return.
But I want you to know that meeting you
has been more than a privilege.
It's touched my heart.
And I know that if I don't kiss you now,
I'm gonna regret it the rest of my days.
Hey!
What the hell's going on?
You are a witnessing a front, three-quarter view
of two adults sharing a tender moment.
Acts like he's never seen a kiss before.
Uh, Gordon?
Take another look, sonny, it's gonna happen again.
All right, class, what did that sip reveal for us?
What flavors are we enjoying?
Tastes kind of woody.
No, not really.
Anyone else? Lana?
Um...
Banana? Yes.
There is a hint of banana. That's the metachloric acid.
Very good.
What else? Banana.
Chocolate.
Correct, Andy.
Why don't we just skip the wine and have a banana split?
Let's take another sip, shall we?
Swallowing this time, and see what else we can discern.
What else can we taste?
What other wonder invites taste buds toward pleasure?
Gosh, Dick.
Well, I just never knew wine could have so many different qualities.
It's amazing, isn't it? A really good wine is like a symphony.
And what is your reaction, Lucy?
I'm pregnant. I'm not supposed to drink.
Love is hell.
Sorry?
Love, it's hell.
The Hindus say love is a ladder to heaven.
The Hindus have also been known to take hikes on hot coals
for recreational purposes.
Self-discipline.
Self-discipline and love? There's a bad match.
Earthly love.
What other kind is there?
When you're in it,
no other.
It hits you like an 18-wheeler, doesn't it? And there's no relief.
It makes you feel more alive.
It makes you feel more of everything.
Pain included.
Especially pain.
I can't stop thinking about her.
Sounds like you've got a pretty serious case.
Brother, I'm roped, tied and branded.
She feel the same way?
Here's hoping.
How about you? You on the critical list too?
Feels like someone's taking a crowbar to my heart.
Hey, that's not bad.
No, I think it's been locked away long enough.
That's good.
Here's hoping. Here's to you.
Mr. Wheeler? Telegram for you, sir. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Damn.
Bellman? Yes, sir.
Kindly tell the front desk I'll be checking out.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
See you.
Good luck. Good luck to you.
Would you pass the peas, Donna?
Thanks.
Mom, could I ask you something? Sure.
How do you know Benjamin Horne?
Uh, Eileen, I told, uh, Donna
about the Heal the Planet benefit you're working on.
Heal the Planet?
I saw him at the house.
You drove to see him yesterday?
Oh. Yes, he's offered to give us some time.
I know he favors several local charities.
Well, that must have been it.
One of the local charities must have sent Mom's roses.
Uh, would you pass the peas, Donna?
I think roses are really romantic, don't you?
Donna, pass your mother the peas.
How's school going?
Great.
All the girls are real excited about Miss Twin Peaks.
Fine tradition. I worked with the pageant for years.
I entered.
Really?
You never seemed very interested before.
Well, I guess I just figured
I could use the scholarship money to study overseas.
We thought at first it might be a bomb.
We don't exactly have a bomb squad, so Andy brought his metal detector.
If it is a bomb, it's not metallic and there's no ticking sound.
Harry, there was a time when I could comprehend,
with a high degree of clarity, Windom Earle's twisted logic.
But his actions of late have left me completely bewildered.
He is changing the pattern of the game board.
Any hope of deducing his next move has evaporated.
Andy, would you please direct everyone
well behind the police cruiser?
Harry, please stand back.
There could be plastic explosives in there...
Agent Cooper wants everyone back behind the cruiser.
Chemicals,
and whatever else hell could imagine.
My greatest fear?
Windom Earle merely condescends to logic.
Leaving us the task of unraveling an insane man's terrifying caprice.
﻿1
Hold it. Watch it, watch it.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Got it. Got it. Thank you.
On your shoulder, put it on your shoulder.
Watch the step. Watch the step.
Easy, easy.
If you need some help down there, say something.
Watch it. Keep it coming.
Don't go too fast. Easy.
Whoa, whoa. whoa.
That's it, come on.
You hit me in the foot.
Watch the car.
The car's right here. That's it.
Watch where you step.
Oh, man.
Rusty?
What was Rusty's last name?
Tomasky.
He got me in with the band. I'm a roadie.
What were you doing in Twin Peaks?
We were supposed to play a gig in Knife River,
but a tire on the van crapped out.
Then you met someone.
Yeah, this guy... This guy came out of the woods,
like Bigfoot or something,
and he was wearing a weird suit.
And we talked to him for a while
and he said he had some brew, you know, would we like some?
So Rusty went with him.
I didn't see him after that.
We'll need to get in touch with Rusty's parents.
Heh. He hated his parents.
He's staying with his uncle in Moses Lake until we were gonna...
We were gonna move.
We were gonna move to L.A.
Andy.
Ow, my foot! Watch it.
He's taken another pawn, Harry,
but he didn't tell us his move.
Windom Earle's playing off the board.
Morning, Lucy. Morning, Sheriff Truman.
Morning, Lucy. Agent Cooper.
Deputy Hawk is in your office, sheriff.
He's with somebody I've never seen before,
but he looks really sad, so Hawk is feeding him breakfast.
Andy.
Yes, Lucy?
What do you know about saving our planet?
I know it's in a lot of trouble.
Andy, I'm taking fate into my own hands.
Mostly because the suspense is too much for me.
Tomorrow is D-day. Dad Day.
In 24 hours, I will choose the father of my child.
Deputy Andy Brennan
or clothing salesman Richard Tremayne.
What does that have to do with the Miss Twin Peaks contest?
I... I mean, we could use the money.
We could also use a father.
So I have to make a speech about saving our planet,
which is a great concept,
but I have no idea how to go about it.
Yet.
I do know that people have got to stop sinking their beer cans in Pearl Lake
when they're fishing.
Oh. Beer cans.
And, um, Styrofoam never dies for as long as you live.
It doesn't?
Randy, has Audrey returned? No, sir.
No messages from her? No, sir.
Would you send someone up for my bags, please?
Certainly.
The insurance companies send me so many forms
that I could get a heart attack just lifting them.
You're fine.
It's what's in your heart you should be worried about.
I know that I have given you reason to doubt me.
But I am only interested in doing the right thing for everybody.
Then stay away from Eileen.
I can't.
Not as long as the lie survives.
Damn it, Ben. It's not that simple.
I believe you.
I applaud your desire to do the right thing.
But goodness in you is... It's like a time bomb.
There's nothing good about ruined lives.
It is a confusing and difficult process.
But I must continue.
Sorry, Will.
Ah. Excuse me. Mm.
Jack, come on in. Hi.
You know Will Hayward?
Yes, hello. I've met your daughter. She's a lovely girl.
I should be getting back to my office.
Nice to see you again, John.
Ben, be careful, please.
I've been looking for Audrey.
Oh. She should be back any minute.
Ben, I gotta go.
They're gassing up the jet as we speak.
Well, you can call her when you get to wherever it is
you are in such a hurry to get to.
A friend of mine...
He was more than a friend. He was a partner... he's been murdered.
Female child.
Mother, Eileen Hayward.
Daughter, Donna Marie.
Father...
Donna? Donna, where are you?
What is it, Mom?
Deputy Hawk is on the phone.
I'll be right there.
He says it's important.
Ms. Horne, I have several messages. Great.
I'll take that for you.
Okay. Thanks.
Audrey.
Agent Cooper would like to see you at the sheriff's station.
Oh, well, I have a lot of work to do. Maybe this afternoon.
Now. It's important.
Okay.
But what about Stop Ghostwood?
How am I supposed to get ahold of you?
I need more time.
A brave man is dead.
He's my friend, and I have to take his place.
You aren't coming back, are you?
Damn this rainforest business anyway.
You can handle this without me.
I don't know. I'm afraid that I'm weak.
Ben Horne, weak? I find that hard to believe.
Strive for goodness, huh?
Tell the hardest truth first.
Just do the best you can.
That's all you really can do.
Hmm.
Well, I'm sorry that Audrey wasn't here.
I want you to give her something for me.
Tell her I...
Just give it to her, will you?
Good luck.
See if any of these symbols have to do
with harvest schedules or ancient calendars.
Look for any curious nomenclature.
Got it, chief.
Good work, Cappy.
Major. How goes the battle? Harry.
Agent Cooper. Major, you look bushed.
Well, I spent the night obtaining and perusing the Project Blue Book files
regarding Windom Earle.
I found it impossible to sleep after.
What have you gleaned?
Earle was the best and brightest among us.
But when our attention turned from outer space
to the wooded areas surrounding Twin Peaks,
he became destructively obsessive.
Earle acted in an overzealous and secretive manner.
Possessive of his assignments, finally violent.
He was removed from the project.
I found this in the project archives.
These... These evil sorcerers, dugpas, they're called,
they cultivate evil for the sake of evil, nothing else.
They express themselves in darkness for darkness
without leavening motive. Uh...
Now, this... This ardent purity allows them to access a secret place
where the cultivation of evil proceeds in exponential fashion,
and with it, the furtherance of evil's resulting power.
This place of power is tangible, and as such, it can be found, entered
and perhaps utilized in some fashion.
The dugpas have many names for it,
but chief among them, ahem, is the... Is the Black Lodge.
You don't believe me, do you? You think I'm mad.
Overworked.
Go away.
Gentlemen, when Windom Earle arrived in Twin Peaks,
I assumed he had come for vengeance.
For me.
But I miscalculated.
He has insinuated himself into the lives of people I care for.
He has murdered innocents.
He has engaged us in subterfuge and red herring.
A fish I don't particularly care for.
But all of these acts are merely camouflage.
He's been after something else all along:
the Black Lodge.
Fellas, we need to find out what this, the Black Lodge, has to do with that.
Do you really believe there's a connection?
Windom Earle does, Harry.
All right. Harry, we're gonna go through these files from top to bottom.
Cappy, I want you to dig up everything you can about the dugpas.
Major, I think you'd better hit the sack.
I could use a good stretch.
Perhaps a walk in the woods to clear my mind.
Good idea. Don't forget the bread crumbs.
Right.
Harry, let's do it.
You know, Leo, the only thing that Columbus discovered
was that he was lost.
Cooper and the gang haven't even left the snide yet.
I know something they don't know.
I know something young Dale merely suspects.
Project Blue Book.
Little men, pewits loaded with optimism. Heh.
They were a deterrent so slight it was practically encouragement.
Yet I would like to ask Major Briggs a question or three.
Polish up that bald nub of his and see what shines.
Perhaps, Leo, we too should venture out for a good stretch.
Wouldn't it be fun to have a Project Blue Book reunion?
Wine, cheese, talk about old times,
trade hilarious anecdotes of the good old days.
I wonder what amongst my detritus I can use to spice up Briggs' life.
Leo, stop dawdling.
If you were outside, you'd have trouble with pigeons.
"And that's the only way we're ever going to save the trees.
It's time to stand up and kick some butt for our environment.
Before it's too late for all of us."
It's beautiful, letter-perfect.
I don't know about the "kick butt" part.
How about, um, "fight"?
It's time to stand up and fight for our environment.
Much better.
Shelly, I've been thinking.
Oh, Bobby, I know, I know, I know.
The speech counts double... Forget about the contest.
I've been thinking about us.
You have?
I know that I have not been paying the right kind of attention to you lately.
I got busy with Mr. Horne.
I started wearing suits, okay, and suddenly I'm walking around
like I'm more important than everybody else.
You were pretty crummy.
Bobby, I've missed you.
I've missed all the things we used to do together.
When I saw you kissing that guy, whew, something snapped.
It was like my brain rolled over,
and I could see all the stuff that was special to me.
All the stuff that matters.
I love you, Shelly.
And I wanna spend my time with that.
I mean, you know, if that's okay with you,
I'd like to do that, you know...
Bobby, what do you think?
Lucky.
Lucky me.
Shelly, telephone.
Agent Cooper's on the line. He needs to talk to you.
Now, Shelly. He says it's important.
I've got great news. What?
It's going to be Norma Jennings and Richard Tremayne.
Tremayne is the third judge. It's in the bag.
Well, now, I have to be sure.
Baby, I have to be sure I'm gonna win.
Oh, my God, this guy's British or Bahamian or something.
He's bound to fall for your charms.
We'll find some way to get you two together, alone.
And then you put on a dress with a slit.
Oh, the slit cut halfway up to Seattle.
And then nestle in real close to him,
and when he gets a look at those gams
and smells that French perfume dripping off you and then
becomes lost in those brown eyes, oh...
Mm, mm, mm.
Oh, stop it. Stop it.
Stop it, you vixen, you.
I can't stand it anymore.
Why can't we just elope and?
No. Now, not until I've won, darling. Oh.
Then, and only then, I will marry you.
Oh...
Oh, you're so strict, darling.
And I am the blasted mayor.
Oh, now, baby, come here.
It's okay. Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.
Each of you received a piece of this poem.
Each in a curious manner, along with this invitation.
We all went to the Roadhouse. Nobody showed up.
Have any of you had contact recently with a stranger?
Someone who struck you as peculiar, personable or just plain puzzling?
Well, there was this strange guy who said he was a friend of my father's.
Same day I got the poem, I got a $10 tip for a cup of coffee.
That's unusual.
You know, there was a funny old guy at the library.
He asked me to read the poem to him.
All three.
Shelly, take a closer look.
Does this handwriting look familiar to you?
It's Leo's.
Listen carefully.
I want each of you to check in with the sheriff twice a day.
Nine o'clock in the morning, 9:00 at night.
I want your parents to know your whereabouts at all times.
You walk to school, you drive to work,
make sure that you do not do so alone.
Please believe me when I tell you to be very careful.
You're in danger.
We all are.
Heh. You would've appreciated the dugpas, Leo.
Ancient sorcerers bent on evil. Ha-ha-ha.
Rather like the Kali worshippers in India.
Another fine bunch of zanies, I can tell you.
Blood for breakfast, blood for lunch.
Those were the good old days.
Shelly. Very good, Leo, you remember.
Tawdry little trollop.
Shelly.
Just between you and me, old boy,
your wife has some fairly modern views on marital fidelity.
But no matter.
She is still fit for a queen.
Would you mourn her passing, Leo? I doubt it.
Her death, Leo.
Shelly's imminent demise.
It's very simple, really.
Shelly wins Miss Twin Peaks, Shelly dies.
Maybe you'd like to help.
Shelly. No.
Good God, what have you got there?
No, Leo, I'm begging you.
I prithee. Have mercy, Leo. Love Shelly.
Poor Leo. Ha-ha-ha.
We are all love's fools, more or less.
But you will learn, as I have,
the value of hate.
Hi.
Hi, Daddy. Oh, Audrey.
Welcome home, honey. Thanks.
Mwah.
I got back this morning but Agent Cooper needed to see me, so...
Something's wrong?
Some creep sent me a poem. Oh.
Um, I tried to call Jack's room, but he wasn't there.
Do you know where he is? Audrey, while you were gone,
I had the most incredible brainstorm. What?
The Stop Ghostwood movement needs a spokesperson.
Someone with a highly visible profile
to be able to inspire our community to action. Huh?
Daddy, where's Jack?
You can do it, Audrey.
As Miss Twin Peaks,
you could be that spokesperson and you could use your public platform...
Heh. No, Dad. ...as a forum for environmental debate.
Audrey, listen, you can do it.
Only you can take our message to the people.
Daddy, where is John Justice Wheeler?
He's gone. Where did he go?
Some tragedy in Brazil demanded his immediate attention.
He left a letter for you. I have it here.
Daddy.
When did he leave? A few minutes ago, the airport.
Audrey, what about Miss Twin Peaks?
I'll talk with you about this later, okay? I promise.
Audrey. Audrey. Audrey?
Josie, I see your face.
Randy. Yes.
Oh, forget it. You.
Do you have a car?
A truck. Runs like a dream.
Great, let's go.
Wait. Oh, I'm sorry.
Come on. Come on.
Well, the symbols suggest a time.
Seems clear.
A time for what? I don't know.
At first I thought it was a signpost. Perhaps it's an invitation.
Or both.
Hmm.
Where's the major?
He should be here by now.
Andy, give Mrs. Briggs a call, see if the major's home yet.
What is it, Coop?
Oh, just thinking about Annie Blackburn.
Well, bless your heart. I've never known your mind to wander.
Oh, Harry, I've been feeling this way all day.
You know, I proceed as usual, my mind clear and focused,
and suddenly, out of nowhere, I see her face and I hear her voice.
Naturally, I try to reorient myself, come back to the task at hand,
but the image remains.
Sometimes I actually feel dizzy.
A man in love is supposed to feel that way.
Well, my symptoms suggest the onset of malaria.
But I've never felt better in my life.
I'm sorry, Harry, that sounds foolish.
No, no, man, it sounds lucky.
Hmm.
Home, home on the range
Where the deer And the antelope play
Where seldom is heard A discouraging word
Hello, Wilbur.
And the skies are not cloudy all day
Long time no see, Briggsy.
Leo.
It looks like you've finally found your calling.
Couldn't hurt to give it a shot.
Maybe next year.
Annie, there's a whole world out there. Jump in.
"Hear the other side. See the other side."
St. Augustine.
Coffee? You bet.
Something's troubling you. Yes.
Would you like to talk about it?
Annie, I'm involved in a fairly complicated investigation
requiring my complete attention.
Yet I spend most of my time thinking of you.
I know the feeling.
I've been seeing your face in fried eggs all this morning.
You know, there are those who believe in a scientific basis for attraction.
It's chemical.
Is that what it is?
I don't know.
Hard to comprehend without perspective.
Yeah.
I spent five years trying to comprehend it, heh.
Hey.
It's hard for me.
But I have faith in you, in us, because I understand it.
We're very much alike.
It helps.
We think too much.
"What we observe is not nature itself,
but nature exposed to our method of questioning."
Heisenberg.
Maybe we should go bowling.
How about dancing?
I don't know how.
I'll teach you. It's easy.
When? Tonight.
There he is. Step on it.
Jack! Jack, stop!
I guess a simple goodbye was out of the question.
I love you.
I love you too.
Do you have to leave? Yes.
When will you be back?
I don't know.
I'm a virgin.
What?
I want you to make love with me.
What? Here and now?
It's your jet.
Thank God for that.
When did you first see the symbol in Owl Cave?
I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Oh-ho-ho.
Cheater. Ha, ha.
What does the cave painting mean?
I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Damn, but I love the military mind.
What is the capital of North Carolina?
Raleigh.
Fat lot of good that will do me.
Major, I admire your fortitude.
Had I the time and patience,
we might continue this game indefinitely.
However,
I have neither.
Catch.
Your name, please?
Garland Briggs.
Garland, what do you fear most in the world?
The possibility that love is not enough.
Oh, Garland, please, I shall weep.
How much does your wife weigh?
One hundred and fifteen pounds.
Oh, good for her.
Now, when did you first see the petroglyph in Owl Cave?
In... In dreams.
What kind of dreams?
I was night fishing with Agent Cooper.
There was a light, guardian beyond it.
I was taken, but my mind...
Still I recognized the signs.
What do the signs mean?
There's a time, if Jupiter and Saturn meet,
they will receive you.
Garland, Garland.
Garland, Garland, I was hoping for a lengthy conversation.
Leo, put the major to bed.
I'm afraid his mind has begun to wander.
There's a time, if Jupiter and Saturn meet.
His woman servant, Jones,
delivered this to me shortly after he died.
Eckhardt's last bequest.
A clever jape, perhaps, or something of value.
Try this.
No, you see, there's a secret to opening each of these boxes.
And this one is about to drive me mad.
Oh, Andrew, tell me something good.
Our foreign investors are chomping at the bit from Paris to Beijing.
You're going to get your golf course.
Right next to The Great Northern Hotel.
And Benjamin is doing everything he can to stop us.
Well, it's too late. When the project was still in his possession,
Ben cleared every possible hurdle:
the zoning, the impact statements.
He was and is his own worst enemy.
As always. What are you doing?
Nothing, Catherine, I'm just trying a few simple combinations.
Let me, let me. No, Catherine.
Eckhardt's birthday.
My birthday.
The day the gift arrived.
Ah! Ha, ha. Ah. Give it to me.
Oh, what a bore. I opened it.
Oh.
Andrew...
Huh.
I'm not completely prepared for this.
Just think of it as a walking embrace, all right?
Two people stepping as one would step.
So far, so good. Now, just follow me.
We'll follow each other. Mm-hm.
Good. Mm-hm.
It's genetic memory.
Mom and Dad danced the lindy.
You've got it.
Your body feels nice against mine.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Listen, if I'm being too forward...
I want more than your kisses. For instance?
I want... This thing on?
Welcome to this final night of festivities
celebrating the Miss Twin Peaks...
As some of you... Damnation, is this damn thing on?
What I mean is I understand why you hesitate,
why you treat me with care.
The convent evokes the image of helpless women,
fearful of the thought of any emotion
other than those derived from scripture and prayer.
But when you hold me,
when we kiss,
I feel safe and eager.
I'm not afraid
of anything that you make me feel or want.
Is this on? Huh? Is this on?
I'm beginning to tire of his interruptions.
Welcome to... I don't know. I think he's cute.
...this final night of festivities... You do?
I think that maybe I will enter after all.
The Miss Twin Peaks contest? Why not?
"Hear the other side. See the other side."
There's worse places to start than Miss Twin Peaks.
It's like a fairy tale.
And you're the queen.
No.
Huh?
What a gyp.
Finally meet the man of my dreams,
next thing I know, he's on a plane to Brazil.
He'll be back one day.
He promised. Yeah.
Well, he also promised to take me fishing, and we never did.
Love stinks.
Fishing? Yeah.
Pearl Lake or something.
I have some tackle in the truck.
You do?
Audrey, there are many cures for a broken heart,
but nothing quite like a trout's leap in the moonlight.
May I?
You may.
Jupiter and Saturn meet
Oh, what a crop of mummy wheat
The planets our babbling major spoke of are more than distant orbs.
They are, in fact, a clock.
A clock that tells the time.
And the time...
Time draws nearer with each ticking tock.
Dale wasn't far wrong. The cave painting is an invitation of sorts,
telling us when the revels begin.
But what Dale doesn't know is where to find it.
For, you see, the cave painting is not only an invitation,
it is also a map.
A map to the Black Lodge!
There's something wrong.
This isn't right. There's something wrong here.
﻿1
Save Shelly. Huh?
Save Shelly.
Why, who in the world let Major Briggs loose, Leo?
It couldn't have been you, could it?
No, no. No punishment, Leo.
It's too late for that to do us any harm.
And I have a new game for you.
Well, here's our contribution to the Miss Twin Peaks gala buffet.
Mm.
And I fully expect to see one of you up there in the winner's circle.
Dream on, Norma. Don't be so sure.
This is the biggest day of the year for us.
And we have to have somebody up there
who really deserves this title.
Especially this year.
You mean Laura Palmer?
It would be a good day for healing.
I think we need more than a day.
So, Norma, are they gonna honor you tonight
on your 20th anniversary of winning Miss Twin Peaks?
Don't remind me.
Come on, if you entered today, you'd win.
Look at you, you're already working on the judge.
Well, since you mentioned it...
Who are you gonna vote for?
Maybe you could split your vote.
Hi, Daddy. Audrey.
The most intelligent face that I've seen all day.
You make the rest of us look like primates.
What's with all the books?
Ah, yes, the Koran,
the Bhagavad-Gita, the Talmud,
the Bible, Old and New Testaments,
the Tao Te Ching.
Audrey, I hold in my hands those holy books
which constitute the fundamental framework
of humanity's philosophy of good.
Somewhere in here are the answers that I seek.
And I intend to read them from cover to cover, until I find...
Aw.
Listen to me prattling on.
It's Jack, isn't it?
It's only been a day.
I hope it doesn't hurt this much in a week.
Honey, may I give you a piece of ageless wisdom
culled from these volumes?
Time heals all wounds.
I know how it feels.
Believe me.
We barely had time to know each other.
But the time that you had was highly concentrated.
It's the concentrate they make concentrate from.
I'm afraid I'll never see him again.
Jack is a man of his word.
And if he said that he'd be back, then he will be back.
I promise you.
Daddy, you can't promise me, but thanks for wanting to.
I actually came here to update you on my trip to Seattle.
Right. Update away.
Okay.
The Packards are using Twin Peaks Savings and Loan
to funnel cash to the Ghostwood project.
But the bank is keeping a very low profile.
It seems they don't want any bad publicity.
Oh, they don't?
Well, bad publicity is exactly what they're gonna get.
Audrey, have you given any more thought
to, uh, the Miss Twin Peaks Pageant?
Daddy...
From the bottom of my heart,
I don't wanna be the town bathing beauty.
I understand.
But Miss Twin Peaks is the ultimate local forum.
Audrey.
It would truly be inspirational
to have a winner with a political sensibility
that extends beyond makeup strategies
and, uh, recipes for cherry pie, huh?
Now, as you know,
each contestant gives a speech to the, uh, assembled town.
This year's theme concerns our immediate environment.
And what we must do to preserve it.
I know there's another way to do this, Daddy.
Audrey, make the speech.
Help stop Ghostwood.
And take us to a better day.
Has he taken his eyes off it yet?
Not today.
And before you ask,
we still got people out combing the woods for Major Briggs.
Harry, considering their mutual connection to Project Blue Book,
I believe that Windom Earle has targeted the major.
What for? Interesting.
I don't know.
But with your permission, I'd like to speak out loud.
Windom Earle has been seeking access to the Black Lodge
as far back as 1965.
This chess game may involve
more pieces than we've begun to imagine.
Then of course, there's the mysterious circumstances
surrounding Josie's death to consider.
What about them? Consider them how?
When she died... I'm sorry I didn't mention this before, Harry,
but I had to take into account your mental state.
What is it?
She was trembling with fear.
I would go as far as to say quaking like an animal.
I might venture a guess to say that it was the fear that killed her.
At the moment of her death...
...I saw Bob.
As if he had slipped in through some crevice in time.
Upon reflection, I believe there's a connection
between his appearance and Josie's fear.
As if he was attracted to it.
Feeding off it somehow.
You see a connection between Bob and the Black Lodge?
Harry, I think it's where he comes from.
I think that the Black Lodge is what you have referred to in the past
as "the evil in these woods."
If Windom Earle is seeking access to that,
it is imperative that we find our way in before he does.
There's a source of great power there, Harry.
Far beyond our ability to comprehend.
Eureka!
Dale, I could kiss your pointy little head.
Mwah. Ha, ha.
It's fear.
It's fear, Leo. That's the key.
My favorite emotional state.
And all this time, it's been staring me right in the kisser.
Leo, it's marvelous, a perfect fit.
These night creatures that hover on the edge of our nightmares
are drawn to us when we radiate fear.
It's their bread and butter.
A perfect symbiosis.
Oh, nature, perfect in design and aspects.
You do not disappoint!
Leo, look lively.
Victory is at hand.
We know where the entrance is. We know when the lock appears.
Now we hold the key in our hands.
Forgive my hasty departure, dear one.
The time has come to gather my beloved queen
and embark upon our dark honeymoon.
I haven't been this excited since I punctured Caroline's aorta.
Leo, we must share a final sentiment.
During our time together in this verdant bower,
I must confess, I've developed something of a fondness for you.
Sounding board, companion,
ever obedient and faithful.
An overall A for effort, Leo.
But I'm still a trifle miffed at your release of Major Briggs.
But then, you'll have plenty of time to reflect upon that, won't you?
Goodbye, Leo.
And good luck.
One and two and three, step four.
And one and two... Let the mood carry you.
Don't be afraid of your vulnerability. Show me more leg.
What kind of a dance is this supposed to be, Mr. Pinkle?
It's a dance of nature, my friend.
It's a celebration. All right, girls.
Now, turn around and bend forward
like a sapling. A sapling in the wind.
That's it. A little bit more, and hold it.
What exactly are we celebrating with us all bending over like this?
Don't ever question the vision of your choreographer!
You are but a petal on my rose.
Now, please, people. On the count of one.
One and two and three and four.
And one and two
and three and four... I love a chorus line. Ha, ha.
If we could just focus here for a second.
I've gotta get back to the diner.
Now, what qualities do we think best exemplify Miss Twin Peaks?
Um, beauty and power.
That's the way I like them.
Poise and, God help us, a sophistication
and breeding.
Well, I think a major factor should be originality.
Well, wouldn't that fall under talent?
It's always nice when it does. Ha, ha.
Personally, I've always been big on style.
I think this is enough for me to work with,
so I'm gonna go back and work up the scoresheets,
and I'll see you tonight. Mm-hm.
Terrific. Bye.
And three and four.
Okay, that's a break, team.
Hi, Dick. We're on break.
Hi, Lana.
Would you mind helping me find something in the storage room?
Storage room? Mm-hm.
We're missing a very important prop.
Come on.
I'm having trouble.
Well, just flick it.
Now, what exactly did you need to find?
Lana? Oh, did I do that?
What are you looking for?
Well, now, I don't know the exact technical name for it, but...
Does anything...? Does anything in here look like it?
Oh, I think this might be it.
Oh, by George, I think you've got it.
Diane, it's 1:17 p.m. I have just concluded
my second meditation of the day in lieu of sleep.
And I feel completely refreshed and struck again by the realization
that all of us on this great big planet Earth
live at only a fraction of our potential.
We are working round the clock on the cave petroglyph.
I am certain that the answers lie in this mysterious etching.
I am also convinced that Windom Earle
is searching for exactly the same thing as we are
for diametrically opposite reasons.
If I'm correct in my assumptions about the power of this unholy place,
God help us if he gets there first.
Diane, at this particular juncture,
I would like to make specific mention of Annie Blackburn.
She is a completely original human being.
Her responses, as pure as those of a child.
I must be honest, I haven't felt this way about a woman since Caroline.
It has taken meeting Annie for me to realize
how gray my life has been since Caroline's death.
How cold and solitary.
Although occasionally,
there is something to be said for solitude.
Annie Blackburn, you have almost perfect timing.
That's not what our choreographer says.
What can I do for you?
Well, I need to, uh, give a speech in six hours.
I haven't written a word,
and, uh, I don't have any idea what I wanna say.
I'm in a complete sweaty-palmed panic,
and I need to talk to someone, namely you.
What's your topic?
What you can do to save our local forests.
I just don't wanna stand up there like some deranged Barbie doll,
saying things like, "Make sure your campfires are out,
kind of like my brain."
You're terrified of public speaking. Yes. Ha, ha.
All right, well...
...our forests need saving because of the way people regard them.
Expendable.
If the Ghostwood development cost thousands of lives,
do you think it would have a chance of going forward?
Well, trees aren't the same as people.
But they are alive.
Your forest is beautiful and peaceful.
Part of it's been damaged.
I've tried to replant, but nothing's taken root.
Every forest has its shadow.
I can see half my life's history in your face,
and I'm not sure that I want to.
I don't wanna talk about trees anymore.
All I know is, I wanna make love with you.
And this is me with last year's regional champion from Yakima.
He was cute, but a little slow. Next.
Oh, and this is me with Brock Farmington,
triple-A champion from Spokane.
Superior upper-body strength,
and quads like bridge supports.
I pinned him in a minute five.
Next.
Oh, this is me with all the stuff I won.
That's nice. Way to go.
Thank you, Nadine.
Well, ahem, now,
I suppose all of you are wondering just why we've gathered here today.
See, I learned that, uh, when a couple is contemplating div...
Uh... Uh... Uh, breaking up,
well, um, uh, sometimes it's easier to talk about our feelings, uh,
when we're around other people.
So, uh, Nadine, maybe you'd like to begin.
Okay.
Um, well, I guess it all started
when I noticed Mike's buns in the hall at school.
Yes, um,
well, how are you feeling now?
Well, a little guilty, I guess.
I mean, Mike and I are hot.
And Miss Twin Peaks is tonight,
and Mr. Pinkle thinks I'm a show-business natural.
Well, I mean, because I'm so happy,
I worry about Ed being sad.
Ed, is there something that you'd like to tell Nadine?
Nadine...
...Norma and I plan on getting married.
Really?
Well, that's wonderful, Eddie,
because Mike and me are getting married too.
Which way is the castle?
I waited for you. Thanks, Harry.
Not that he's too talkative.
He checks out okay physically. Doc ran some blood tests.
He's been shot full of haloperidol.
Right.
Garland?
Did Windom Earle do this to you?
Garland?
Odd name.
Judy Garland?
Was it Windom Earle?
It was God, I suppose.
Garland, where did he take you?
The woods?
Can you be more specific?
They were lovely.
Dark. The king of Romania was unable to attend.
Harry, this is gonna take some time.
How much time we got? Not enough.
Let's leave him here with us. Maybe something will bubble up.
Harry, we're in trouble.
If the door to the Black Lodge does exist,
it probably exists at a point in time.
Now, an object, such as a door,
normally exists at a point in time and space.
By way of contrast,
a shooting star normally exists at a point in time
over a continuum of space.
But taken from the star's point of view, it's a completely different experience.
You just lost me.
If we're not at the right place at exactly the right time,
we won't find our way in.
Sheriff?
Could the Four-H Club have anything to do with all of this?
Doubtful, Andy.
This has to be the last box. Look at it.
I can't take any more of this.
Boxes inside boxes.
Whatever is in that better be worth a fortune.
Maybe it's not a box at all.
Maybe it's just a block of stainless steel.
Eckhardt's last little joke. It'd be a good one.
Let's channel some of that high wit into the job.
Again.
I can't believe a little crumb like that
can stand up to this Cram Jack all-duty vise.
On three. One, two and three!
I'm sorry, Andrew. That was my fault.
Dumb boxes!
Andrew!
Darn boxes.
Nice shooting, Andrew.
Look at that.
A key!
And where there's a key, there's a lock.
It should be kept safe.
Yes, in plain sight.
You two don't trust each other?
Of course we do.
Like brother, like sister.
How about here?
In the cake saver.
In plain sight.
So we have a key. Yes, we do.
You look truly beautiful.
Read us your speech.
I'd rather talk about the truth right now.
What truth is that?
I know something's going on with you and Benjamin Horne,
and I wanna know what it is.
Donna, don't talk to your mother like that.
You know, I'm really tired of you talking to me like I'm a child.
I wanna know what's going on.
Donna, I understand your feeling.
But there are some things you just have to trust.
You're young and you don't know all the limitations.
I know the limitations of lying.
I know that you raised me to tell the truth.
I expect the same from you.
If you're not gonna tell me what I need to know,
I'll find out from Benjamin Horne.
No. Then tell me.
All right, this is your choice, not mine.
Donna.
Donna!
By heavens.
Andy, take a look at this.
What you mistook for the Four-H Club,
the four and the H, are actually astrological symbols.
You mean, like planets? Why, yes, Andy.
They stand for Jupiter and Saturn.
Some of the others represent planets as well,
but this particular part of the puzzle pertains to a precise planetary position.
Jupiter and Saturn in conjunction. What's that supposed to mean?
Well, historically, Harry, when Jupiter and Saturn are conjunct,
there are enormous shifts in power and fortune.
Jupiter being expansive in its influence,
Saturn, contractive.
Conjunction suggests a state of intensification, concentration.
What this indicates to me is the potential for explosive change,
good and bad. So when's the next conjunction?
Well, now, let's see.
According to the ephemeris...
...the next conjunction is due January to June.
My God, Harry.
The door to the lodge.
That's when it's open. That's what the puzzle is telling us.
It's telling us when it's gonna be open.
Protect the queen.
If it's telling us when, then it must also tell us where.
Fear and love open the doors.
What's he saying?
He said, "Fear and love open the doors."
Two doors, two lodges.
Fear opens one, the black.
Love, the other. What's that mean?
I don't know exactly. It just came to me.
How does the queen...?
Of course, the queen. Of Romania?
No. The chess game's final piece. Harry, follow my logic.
If Windom Earle takes the queen... Game's not over till he takes the king.
That depends. Maybe he takes her to the doorway when it opens.
Which queen? Agent Cooper.
Just a minute, Andy.
The queen. The queen. The crown. The queen.
Harry, the queen. Agent Cooper?
Andy, please.
Harry, Miss Twin Peaks.
Holy smokes, that's it. Yeah. Yeah.
Agent Cooper, please.
Andy.
Coop, the plant's been bugged.
This bonsai isn't from Josie, Harry.
This bonsai's from Windom Earle.
He's way ahead of us,
and we've been working for him from the beginning.
What time does that contest start? Any minute.
Let's go.
Agent Cooper. Agent Cooper!
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
I hope you've had a good weekend.
And welcome to the Miss Twin Peaks Pageant,
in which one of these lovely and talented young citizens
will soon be crowned Miss Twin Peaks.
And now, commencing our talent section of the show,
Lucy Moran.
Come on.
Small town, man.
So, what, did you bring your whole family?
We're pulling in deputies from all over to surround the place.
They should be here any time.
Harry, it is essential whoever wins this contest receive 24-hour guard,
house security, I want the works.
As soon as she's announced.
Our next entry is Lana Budding-Milford,
who will perform a dance of, uh...
...contortionistic jazz exotica.
Lana? Agent Coop...
There, my friend, is a real artist.
There is only one way to save a forest, an idea, or anything of value.
And that is by refusing to stand by and watch it die.
There is a law of nature, which is more fundamental to life
than the laws of man.
And when something you care about is in danger,
you must fight to save it
or lose it forever.
Thank you.
Thank you, Audrey Horne.
Now a brief musical interlude.
Thanks, Daddy.
I'm gonna go out there.
I wanna know what's going on with you and my mother.
Donna.
Uh...
I, uh, think the wisest course would be,
first of all, just to get together and talk about this.
I don't think so.
Donna, I really don't think this is the time or the place.
Old pictures, Horne bearer bonds in the attic,
love letters to my mom.
I want to tell the truth. I want to do the right thing.
A birth certificate with no father's name on it.
What the hell's going on here, Mr. Horne?
Why won't anyone tell me the truth?
Donna.
Your mother and I...
You're my father?
Donna.
And to illustrate my point,
I'd like to quote these words from Chief Seattle,
leader of the Suquamish tribe:
"Your dead are soon forgotten and never return.
Our dead never forget the beautiful world that gave them being.
They still love its verdant valleys,
its murmuring rivers, its majestic mountains.
When the last red man has vanished from this earth,
these forests and shores will still hold their spirits."
For the Indians love the earth
as a newborn loves its mother's heartbeat.
Why have we all lost touch with this beauty?
Maybe saving a forest starts with preserving some of the feelings
that die inside us every day.
Those parts of ourselves that we deny.
For if we cannot respect that interior land,
then neither can we respect the land we walk.
So let us, in walking gently upon the earth,
leave behind a simple legacy.
That we're new warriors,
mystic warriors who love the earth
and tried to save it.
Thank you very much.
Thanks to all our contestants.
Balloting will now commence, and we will then announce our winner.
Have you both forgotten what day this is?
Miss Twin Peaks Day?
Today is the day my unborn child receives a dad.
It was right on the tip of my tongue.
I have decided
that regardless of which individual is biologically responsible,
that I want Andy to be the father of my child.
Really?
I'm sorry, Dick, but I just have to do what's best for little what's-his-name.
Oh, no, not at all. A sound choice.
Heartiest congratulations, dearest Andrew.
Now, if you'll both excuse me, I do have a vote to cast myself.
Here's to the children. Ha, ha.
Don't sound so disappointed.
My God, Lucy.
I'm so honored you made this decision.
And I promise I'll be a great father.
But right now
I've got to find Agent Cooper.
Men.
It is time to make the announcement.
The winner of the contest
and our new Miss Twin Peaks is...
...Annie Blackburn.
Ladies and gentlemen, your new Miss Twin Peaks!
This is an outrage.
She's been living in this town about 15 minutes.
And what the hell got into you?
She gave a beautiful speech.
Inherent in her message were words
even the most craven of us can ill afford to ignore.
What's happening?
Everybody, please, please, stay calm.
Good Lord.
This way.
Settle down. Everybody settle down. Don't panic! This way.
I will help you. Aah!
Annie?
Annie?
Harry. What?
He took Annie. What?
He got Annie.
Bastard. He won't get half a mile from here. We'll get him.
Agent Cooper, I've been looking all over for you.
Andy, they're gonna need you outside.
This is important.
That cave painting in the office, I finally figured it out.
What? I knew I'd seen it someplace before.
I know where it's telling us to go.
It's not a puzzle at all.
It's a map.
﻿1
Were you afraid, Punky?
I was on the stage at the Roadhouse, and the lights went out.
I kept thinking:
"The lights are going out, the lights are going out."
And then they did.
And it all went black, and I kept thinking:
"It's so dark, what about hand signals?
What good would they do us now?
And the baby, what if the lights went out in the hospital
and we were in the elevator?"
Then I'd help you have that baby right there in the elevator,
in front of God and everybody.
I love you. I love you.
Coop, I've got deputies from three counties looking for Earle.
He seems to have completely disappeared.
Harry, the only hope we have of finding them
is somewhere in this map.
Giant, little man,
fire, fire walk with me.
Fire walk with me.
Grand theft auto.
The Log Lady stole my truck.
'68 Dodge pickup.
Powder blue.
I tried to chase after her, but she took off
on the road up towards the woods.
Pete, the Log Lady did not steal your truck.
The Log Lady will be here in one minute.
The woods, Harry,
Ghostwood forest. Ghostwood?
Twelve rainbow trouts in the bed.
Twelve.
Wait a doggone minute.
There's a circle of 12 sycamores.
Glastonbury Grove.
Sycamores.
That's where I found the bloody towel and the pages of the diary.
The legendary burial place of King Arthur.
Glastonbury.
King Arthur's buried in England.
Well, last I heard anyway.
Right on time.
It's the Log Lady.
Where's my truck?
Pete, Windom Earle stole your truck.
I brought the oil.
Thank you, Margaret.
It sure looked to me like you.
Margaret,
what did your husband say exactly about this oil?
He brought it back one night just before he died and said:
"This oil is an opening to a gateway."
Intriguing, isn't it?
Jacoby.
Scorched engine oil. Scorched engine oil.
Hawk, bring in Ronette Pulaski.
Ronette, thanks for coming in.
Do you recognize this smell?
Yes.
The night Laura Palmer was killed.
Glastonbury Grove.
I am Windom Earle.
Windom Earle?
Take a look at that.
Twelve rainbow trout.
If you're gonna kill me, get it over with.
There's plenty of time for that.
But I do like the fear I'm feeling.
Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth,
as when one cutteth wood upon the earth.
But mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord:
in thee is my trust; leave not my...
Keep me from the snares they have laid for me,
and the gins of the workers of iniquity.
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
What are we doing here?
You and I have an appointment at the end of the world.
He'll come for me. No, he won't.
Why are you doing this to me? Same thing happened last time.
When he fell in love with my wife.
I took the boy right to the edge that time.
Come in, come in to the circle!
I tell you, they have not died.
Their hands clasp, yours and mine.
You'll not run from me now,
not in this circle of trees.
You'll come with me.
Remember, 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off with the ice bag.
It'll help with the swelling, both of you.
Take some aspirin, call me in the morning.
Thanks, doc.
Oh. Does it hurt much, baby?
God, Nadine, I was so worried about you.
I admit there were times when I had my doubts
about what we meant to each other, but seeing that sandbag hit you,
I just knew
I'd practically do anything for you.
And then the tree hit me.
I love you.
There, I've said it and I'm glad.
Who are you?
Mike.
You...
You try to... You say your name is Mike?
What are you doing in my house?
You brought me here, Nadine.
No!
No, you get out of here!
Ed, make him go away.
What's she doing here?
Oh.
It's not fair.
Please...
Ed, make...
Where are my drape runners? Where are my drape runners?
Nadine, how old are you?
What kind of a stupid question is that?
Answer me. How old are you?
Thirty-five, you moron!
I'm sorry, Ed.
I think I let things get a little out of hand.
Oh, no. No.
Donna, please. Donna, please, listen.
I've heard enough! Please, just let me explain.
Donna... Leave me alone!
It isn't your parents' fault. It's mine.
My parents? Who are my parents anyway?
I only wanted to do good. I wanted to be good.
And it felt so good to tell the truth
after all these years.
Ben, damn it.
Will. Donna.
Ben, I warned you. Get out of my house.
Will,
can you forgive me for what I have done to you?
Sylvia, I told you to stay home.
What are you trying to do to this family?
Daddy, you're my daddy. You're my daddy.
You're my daddy.
Daddy.
Leave my family alone!
Now, Will. Will!
Will! Unh!
No!
Ah. I knew I'd seen it somewhere.
Safety deposit box.
They'll never notice the difference.
Oh, Andrew.
Good night, Pete.
Harry,
this way.
Coop?
Harry, I have to go on alone.
Why?
What?
Oh.
Sycamore trees.
An opening to a gateway.
Footprints.
My God.
Under the sycamore tree
And I'll see you
And you'll see me
And I'll see you in the branches
That blow in the breeze
I'll see you in the trees
Under the sycamore tree
Sheriff Truman?
Andy! Over here!
Been about ten hours since he went in there.
Do you want a thermos of coffee?
Yeah.
Do you want a plate special?
Yeah.
Do you want dessert?
Yeah.
Do you want pie?
Harry?
Morning, Mr. Mibbler. Audrey Horne.
This is my fortunate day.
Is there anything I can do for you?
As a matter of fact, there is. You can call the Twin Peaks Gazette.
Ask to speak with Dwayne Milford Jr.
Dwayne? The editor.
Eh?
Heh. We must make a telephone call.
Uh, yes? Yes.
Tell him that Audrey Horne has chained herself
to the Twin Peaks Savings and Loan vault
in protest of their financial ties
to the Ghostwood Development Project.
And that I intend to stay here until a town meeting is held
to debate the future of our environment
and specifically the effect of the Ghostwood Project upon it.
Okay? Yeah, miss.
And can I get a glass of water, please?
Uh... Uh...
Thank you, Dell.
You, you.
You!
Heh, heh. Dell Mibbler, as I live and breathe.
He's alive.
But the funeral.
And all of the flowers, and the choir boys.
I was hoping you could do a small favor for me.
Does this look familiar to you?
Yes, it's one of our safety deposit keys.
Aha. Shall we? Well, of course.
But there is going to be a bit of a problem.
A bit of a problem.
Hi, Pete. Audrey?
Young lady, why are you chained to the bank vault?
Civil disobedience.
Ah. Ha, ha.
Waste no time arguing what a good man should be, be one.
Marcus Aurelius. I admire your verve.
I see no problem here. If you'll excuse us, please?
Sure.
Did you call the Gazette yet?
Maybe you should call the sheriff too. Ask for Agent Cooper.
Give me the key.
A boy? It's a boy!
It's a boy, it's a boy.
So long. So long.
We've come to the end of a long road, Pete.
And here we are.
Oh, sh...!
Mm.
Shelly, I think we should get married.
Bobby.
Leo. I'm still wearing his ring.
Oh, what kept us, Heidi?
Seconds on knackwurst this morning?
I couldn't get my car started.
Too busy jump-starting the old man.
Again. Again.
I thought you Germans were always on time.
Shelly... Bobby.
Leo's probably up in the woods having the time of his life.
Well, you were right, there's the major.
Excuse us, Major Briggs, for the intrusion,
but Sarah here had a message for you that she thought was important.
Sarah.
I'm in the Black Lodge with Dale Cooper.
I'm waiting for you.
[DISTORTED
Whoo!
Caroline.
Annie.
Annie!
Annie. Annie.
Annie?
Annie,
the face of the man who killed you?
Annie?
Caroline.
I will.
Cooper!
Annie!
Annie.
Annie!
There he is.
Coop?
I wasn't sleeping.
Annie, how's Annie?
She's gonna be just fine.
She's over at the hospital.
I need to brush my teeth.
Sure. Come on.
I'll help you up.
Take her easy now.
I need to brush my teeth.
Good idea.
Coop?
Coop, are you okay?
Coop?
How is Annie? How's Annie?
How's Annie?
How's Annie? How's Annie?
How's Annie?
