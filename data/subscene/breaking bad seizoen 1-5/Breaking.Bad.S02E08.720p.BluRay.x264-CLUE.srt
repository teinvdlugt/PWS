1
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,626
Hey.

2
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:26,922
You...

3
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:29,258
You selling?

4
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:32,052
I don't know
what you're talking about.

5
00:00:32,261 --> 00:00:34,471
Okay. That's cool.

6
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:40,978
I'm just saying, you know,
if you were selling...

7
00:00:41,312 --> 00:00:43,689
...I could maybe do with a teenth.

8
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:48,277
You're kidding, right?

9
00:00:49,278 --> 00:00:51,614
Dude, I so smell bacon.

10
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:54,116
What? What are you talking about?

11
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:55,993
Oh, gee, I don't know.

12
00:00:56,201 --> 00:00:59,038
How about over there.
That brown van.

13
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:01,415
That's yours, right?

14
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:03,542
What brown van?

15
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:05,919
Parked all inconspicuous.

16
00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:08,213
It's a cop van.

17
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:11,467
Yeah, another one right over there.

18
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:14,928
"Duke City Flowers"? Come on.

19
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:17,181
Can't you at least be original?

20
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:19,808
Dude, I just wanna get high.

21
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:22,227
A flower van.

22
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:25,564
You know what you should do
is a garbage truck.

23
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:27,733
Seriously, and I don't mean
to disrespect...

24
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:30,527
...but if you put cops
in the back of a garbage truck...

25
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:32,821
...there's no way
I'm seriously thinking...

26
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,325
...that there's cops
in the back of a garbage truck.

27
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:39,161
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.

28
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,538
Think about it, boys.

29
00:01:42,623 --> 00:01:45,584
All right. I'm hitting it.

30
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:48,253
You dudes give up that easy?

31
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:50,464
I'm not a cop.

32
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:54,635
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

33
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:57,888
All right, you know what?

34
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:00,891
Just to show you
you're being an asshole.

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,185
I'm blinded by white.

36
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:04,395
Douchebag.

37
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:07,106
Come on. I was joking. Come on.

38
00:02:07,314 --> 00:02:10,693
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down. Come on.

39
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:14,196
I mean, what are you
complaining about?

40
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:16,657
You got abs, man. Kind of.

41
00:02:16,865 --> 00:02:18,742
Whatever, dude.

42
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:20,661
I'm not even sure
I wanna buy anymore.

43
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:23,539
I think you turned me off
to the whole thing.

44
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:25,791
Come on. Don't be like that.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,211
I just need you to prove it,
you know?

46
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,921
Prove you're not a cop.

47
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,841
How the hell
am I supposed to do that?

48
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:36,385
I don't know.

49
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:40,973
Hey, I got it. Go over there
and punch that dude right in the face.

50
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:42,933
Which dude?

51
00:02:43,142 --> 00:02:44,393
- That dude?
- Yeah.

52
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:47,062
No way. He'd kick my ass.

53
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:49,565
True that.

54
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:54,194
- This is so hard, you know?
- Yeah.

55
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:58,532
I know.

56
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:00,576
It's simple.

57
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:05,247
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,
he's, like, obligated to tell you.

58
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:07,333
It's in the Constitution.

59
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,668
Constitution of America?

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,632
So go ahead and ask.

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,134
- You a cop?
- No, no. Not like that.

62
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:19,470
Ask it, like, official.

63
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:22,264
Are you a police officer?

64
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:26,352
No, I am not a police officer.

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,605
Okay, then. Hundred
and seventy-five for a teenth.

66
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:32,608
The price is the price, yo.

67
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:38,739
All right.

68
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:07,101
There you go. Enjoy.

69
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:09,728
Thanks, man.

70
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:18,821
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest! Get on the ground!

71
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,492
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach! Get on the ground!

72
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:27,621
Hold it right there. Don't move.
Stay down.

73
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:53,731
<i>I had a good job
until my boss accused me of stealing.</i>

74
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,900
<i>I'd better call Saul!</i>

75
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,449
<i>I was out partying,
minding my own business...</i>

76
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:08,370
<i>- You are under arrest.
- I'd better call Saul!</i>

77
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:10,372
<i>Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.</i>

78
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:12,291
<i>Did you know that you have rights?</i>

79
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:14,960
<i>The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.</i>

80
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,129
<i>I believe that until proven guilty...</i>

81
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:20,507
<i>...every man, woman,
and child in this country is innocent.</i>

82
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:22,676
<i>And that's why I fight for you,
Albuquerque.</i>

83
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:23,886
<i>Better call Saul.</i>

84
00:05:24,094 --> 00:05:26,180
<i>Saul Goodman, attorney at law,
505-164-CALL.</i>

85
00:05:26,388 --> 00:05:29,391
<i>That's 505-164-CALL.</i>

86
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:34,772
I really need to get some furniture.

87
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:37,566
I suggest you start with a bed.

88
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:43,530
God, I wish we could smoke in here.

89
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:47,076
- Well, you can't.
- Yeah, no. I know.

90
00:05:47,284 --> 00:05:49,286
I'm just saying.

91
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:53,540
Don't think I can't smell that weed.

92
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,626
You better seriously hope
that airs out.

93
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:58,587
My dad will keep
your security deposit.

94
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:03,092
He has a nose
like a damn bloodhound.

95
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,927
Yeah?

96
00:06:05,135 --> 00:06:09,348
Has he ever caught you?

97
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:14,186
Yeah. Many times.

98
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:17,064
Well, listen.

99
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:21,110
Since I already lost my deposit
and all...

100
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:23,904
...maybe we should light up.

101
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:29,493
No, thanks.

102
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:30,703
You sure?

103
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:34,665
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

104
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:37,126
Maybe you'll change your mind.

105
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:43,424
Do what you wanna do, I guess.

106
00:06:49,471 --> 00:06:51,765
Hey. What'd I say?

107
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:53,809
Nothing.

108
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,979
I just have to go is all.

109
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:17,458
What's this?

110
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:20,628
My 18-month chip.

111
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:24,340
I'm in recovery.

112
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:30,179
And, you know,
pot is like stepping stones.

113
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:36,727
Recovery? That's cool.

114
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:38,270
Right on.

115
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:40,648
I respect that.

116
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:43,692
You know,
I don't really burn much anymore.

117
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:46,820
It's just a sometime thing.

118
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:51,033
But no more, like, in the house.

119
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:57,831
So you wanna go grab
some dinner?

120
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,542
I could really go for some Chinese.

121
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:02,211
No, I better hit it.

122
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:05,631
We...

123
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:07,549
We cool?

124
00:08:11,095 --> 00:08:12,680
Your satellite is on, by the way.

125
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:18,352
That screen is badass.

126
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,743
I just think it's asking a lot.

127
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:36,954
He knows it.

128
00:08:37,162 --> 00:08:38,831
He's done nothing but apologise.

129
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,959
Is this gonna be
every weekend now?

130
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:45,462
No. It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.

131
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:50,259
But I am earning double time,
so there's a bright side.

132
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:52,845
So when the laziest boy
in the world wakes up...

133
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:55,014
...tell him he better wash
those sneakers.

134
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:56,223
And I said bye.

135
00:08:56,432 --> 00:08:58,767
And tell him
to let them air-dry this time.

136
00:08:58,976 --> 00:09:01,729
I don't want him
banging the hell out of my dryer.

137
00:09:02,563 --> 00:09:03,564
What?

138
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,401
What, you don't even get
casual Saturday?

139
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,694
I mean...

140
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:10,571
No, it's just you...

141
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:12,698
You look nice is all.

142
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:15,117
It's work, Walt.
And everybody is gonna be there.

143
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:17,286
- Okay.
- Okay.

144
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:19,955
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

145
00:09:20,164 --> 00:09:21,582
Okay.

146
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,292
- Bye.
- Bye.

147
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:38,766
<i>Hi. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>

148
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:41,310
<i>Please leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.</i>

149
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:46,023
<i>Skyler? Are you there?
I don't know what to do.</i>

150
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:49,818
<i>I... I need to talk to you. I...</i>

151
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:53,572
Hey, Marie. It's me. What's up?

152
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:02,915
Yesterday I got home
and found him.

153
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:06,085
He didn't even tell me
he was coming.

154
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:10,005
- A man was killed?
- A Federale, right in front of him.

155
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:14,301
Three agents wounded,
one lost his leg.

156
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,138
It's like what you hear about
from Iraq or something.

157
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:21,141
- The IEDs.
- Oh, Jesus.

158
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,186
I had to hear about it
from Steve Gomez.

159
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:26,814
Hank talked to his ASAC
for about an hour.

160
00:10:27,022 --> 00:10:30,276
Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.

161
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:33,529
He hangs up the phone,
goes right back to bed.

162
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:39,576
And all he keeps saying is,
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."

163
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:05,394
Baby, not now.

164
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:09,607
It's-- It's me, Hank. Sorry.

165
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:15,404
Hey, buddy. What's...?

166
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:17,156
What's up?

167
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:21,076
I just...

168
00:11:21,535 --> 00:11:23,662
Do you mind if I...?

169
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:25,873
No. No.

170
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:29,752
So...

171
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:34,214
How you doing?

172
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:37,468
Oh, you know, lousy.

173
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:39,553
Montezuma's revenge, bigtime.

174
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:45,100
I mean, everything's going through me
like crap through a tinhorn.

175
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:47,061
Better not get too close.

176
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:50,230
Well, I'll take my chances.

177
00:11:58,572 --> 00:12:02,242
I guess you heard about
what happened down in Juárez?

178
00:12:03,953 --> 00:12:05,621
Terrible.

179
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:08,958
What do you expect?
Bunch of freaking animals.

180
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,793
<i>It's like Apocalypse Now
down there.</i>

181
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:14,838
It's like Colonel Kurtz
holed up in his jungle.

182
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:19,969
And my SAC in El Paso
sends me home.

183
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:24,556
Now, that's a sound leadership
decision right there, huh?

184
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:27,851
You know, you don't put
your second most senior man...

185
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,145
...on the trail
of those motherless bastards...

186
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:32,856
...you send him home. You know?

187
00:12:33,357 --> 00:12:35,985
I was, you know--
"He's out getting an evidence bag...

188
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:38,112
...and so ends up
without a scratch on him.

189
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,824
So must be something wrong
with that picture, you know."

190
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:47,329
So are you home for good then?

191
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:50,833
No, no. It's...

192
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:54,920
Playing it by ear. To be determined.

193
00:12:57,464 --> 00:13:01,260
Think you might wanna talk it through
with somebody?

194
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:04,513
What, a shrink?
No, no, no. Can't go down that road.

195
00:13:04,722 --> 00:13:07,433
Start going down that road,
kiss your career goodbye.

196
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:14,315
Or Marie. Or me, if you like.

197
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:24,700
You know, I don't know
how to say this. I...

198
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:28,787
You know, the things I deal with...

199
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:33,250
...you and me don't have much of a--

200
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:37,504
What you might call
"an experiential overlap."

201
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:48,182
What if I told you we do?

202
00:13:55,689 --> 00:14:00,152
I have spent my whole life scared.

203
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:05,324
Frightened of things
that could happen...

204
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:07,868
...might happen, might not happen.

205
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:11,580
Fifty years I spent like that.

206
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:16,919
Finding myself awake
at 3 in the morning.

207
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:22,341
But you know what?

208
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:25,928
Ever since my diagnosis...

209
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:29,556
...I sleep just fine.

210
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:36,814
Okay.

211
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:42,820
And I came to realise
it's that fear that's the worst of it.

212
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:45,197
That's the real enemy.

213
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:49,535
So...

214
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:53,205
Get up.

215
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:55,958
Get out in the real world.

216
00:14:56,583 --> 00:15:01,338
And you kick that bastard
as hard as you can right in the teeth.

217
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:19,064
Do it again. Go on.

218
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:29,325
Ten thousand even, same as last time.
It's totally accurate.

219
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:31,952
You and I,
we are gonna feed this machine.

220
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:35,789
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.

221
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:44,798
Not yours, I take it.

222
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,931
We got 10, 20, 30...

223
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:57,144
...44, five each.

224
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:02,483
Three pounds should be 48 each.

225
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:03,734
Who's short?

226
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:06,695
All right. Don't freak, all right?
We didn't get ripped off.

227
00:16:06,904 --> 00:16:08,864
But Badger hasn't kicked in
his full amount.

228
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:11,367
I know he was planning on pulling
an all-nighter...

229
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:13,285
...so he's probably still in the sack.

230
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:17,373
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.

231
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:20,042
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?

232
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,753
You're not his pal. You're his boss.

233
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:25,381
This only works when
they're scared of you, remember?

234
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,676
Jack-off.

235
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:34,056
It's going straight to voice-mail.

236
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:36,558
Voicemail?

237
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:40,813
Just chill, okay? Count your money.

238
00:16:46,068 --> 00:16:47,319
<i>- Combo.
- Yo, what's up?</i>

239
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,738
You seen Badger?

240
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:52,658
Don't you cover for him, bitch.

241
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:55,744
I ask you a straight-up question,
I expect a straight-up answer.

242
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,012
Well?

243
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:19,351
They were too scared to tell me.

244
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:22,605
Badger got busted.

245
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:24,607
He's in jail.

246
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:04,396
<i>Honey, I'm home!</i>

247
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:06,815
Too slow! What's up?

248
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:08,817
Got more lives than a damn cat.

249
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:10,986
Now if I could only learn
to lick myself.

250
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:15,324
What's up, guys? Good to see you.
Good to see you. Good to see you.

251
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:19,328
All right. Let's all get back to work,
for chrissake, okay?

252
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:22,790
In my office, man. Let's see
what you bozos been up to lately.

253
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:47,356
You okay?

254
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:49,066
Hanging in?

255
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:50,985
What's it look like?

256
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:54,530
- What's this from A.P.D.?
- Been checking with them to see...

257
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:57,199
...if they come across
that famous blue meth of yours.

258
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:59,868
Sure enough, last night.

259
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:02,496
Got themselves
an honest-to-God dealer.

260
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:06,000
I was thinking of cruising over
and saying hello.

261
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,210
Maybe you'd like to go with me?

262
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:11,714
Yeah. Well, all right.

263
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:14,717
You told me to my face
you weren't a cop, man.

264
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:17,344
I feel manipulated.

265
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:19,138
I thought we were gonna hang out.

266
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:20,848
We are hanging out, Badger.

267
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:23,392
You like Badger or Brandon?

268
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:28,689
I like people who don't, like,
abuse the Constitution.

269
00:19:28,897 --> 00:19:30,065
Badger, listen.

270
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,026
Hey.

271
00:19:32,443 --> 00:19:34,778
I'm trying to help you here, man.

272
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:39,658
Now, if you just tell me
who your supplier is...

273
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:42,786
...I think this can end
very well for you.

274
00:19:43,787 --> 00:19:46,999
What are you doing, detective, talking
to my client without me present?

275
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:48,250
You sneaky Pete.

276
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:50,919
Which is which?

277
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:53,547
What, did the academy hire you
right out of the womb?

278
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:55,549
You guys get younger every--

279
00:19:55,758 --> 00:19:57,426
What'd you say to baby face?

280
00:19:57,635 --> 00:19:59,053
Did you say anything stupid?

281
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:01,263
By "anything stupid,"
I mean anything at all.

282
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:03,933
Look at you.
Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter.

283
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:06,477
We'll talk about it later.
Right now, you out.

284
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:09,939
Ten minutes ago. Go on.
There are laws, detective.

285
00:20:10,147 --> 00:20:12,316
Have your kindergarten teacher
read them to you.

286
00:20:12,524 --> 00:20:16,236
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap. Go on.

287
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:20,783
All right.

288
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:23,702
Who do we have?

289
00:20:24,411 --> 00:20:25,621
Brandon Mayhew.

290
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:29,124
Brandon Mayhew. All right.

291
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,710
Brandon Mayhew.

292
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:37,549
- Here we go. Public masturbation.
- What?

293
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:40,636
I don't get it. What's the kick?
Why don't you do it at home...

294
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:44,473
...with a big flat-screen TV,
50 channels of pay-per-view?

295
00:20:44,682 --> 00:20:47,184
In a Starbucks. That's nice.

296
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:49,311
That ain't me, man. I...

297
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,275
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.

298
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:57,319
Okay. All right. I got you.
Meth. Right.

299
00:20:57,528 --> 00:20:59,655
Sorry, that was a little
transpositional error.

300
00:20:59,863 --> 00:21:02,491
Nothing a little Wite-Out
can't take care of.

301
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,619
Yeah, and felony quantity.

302
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:08,122
- Just barely.
- Yeah, just barely.

303
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,375
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.

304
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,460
But good luck arguing that in court.

305
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,380
Let me get down to brass tacks.

306
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:18,299
I'm gonna get you
a second phone call.

307
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:20,509
You're gonna call
your mommy or your daddy...

308
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:23,095
...or your parish priest
or your Boy Scout leader...

309
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:26,432
...and they're gonna
deliver me a cheque for $4650.

310
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,268
I'm gonna write that down
on the back of my business card.

311
00:21:29,476 --> 00:21:32,021
Four-six-five-zero. Okay?

312
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:36,358
And I need that in a cashier's cheque
or a money order, doesn't matter.

313
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:39,028
Actually, I want it in a money order.

314
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:41,989
And make it out to
"Ice Station Zebra Associates."

315
00:21:42,197 --> 00:21:44,658
That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.

316
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:46,910
It's done just for tax purposes.

317
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,663
And after that,
we can discuss Visa or MasterCard...

318
00:21:49,872 --> 00:21:53,751
...but definitely not American Express,
so don't even ask. All right?

319
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,002
Any questions?

320
00:21:58,047 --> 00:21:59,923
You're gonna get me off, right?

321
00:22:01,008 --> 00:22:04,803
What do I look like, your high-school
girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting?

322
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:08,682
That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up.

323
00:22:09,224 --> 00:22:12,686
Son, I promise you this.

324
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:16,023
I will give you
the best criminal defence...

325
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:17,608
...that money can buy.

326
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:21,695
Yeah, but, Francesca,
I took these already.

327
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:23,614
Didn't I take these already?

328
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:26,784
It's on your head. You're not
supposed to double up on vitamin A.

329
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:28,869
It's bad for the liver.

330
00:22:30,454 --> 00:22:32,581
Okay, who's next?

331
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,042
Did him. I did him.

332
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,503
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.

333
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:40,798
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.

334
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,883
Hang on. I'll get back to you.

335
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:47,846
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?

336
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:50,683
Sure. Your commercials?
They suck ass.

337
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,019
I've seen better acting
in an epileptic whorehouse.

338
00:22:54,228 --> 00:22:55,980
Is that like the one
your mom works at?

339
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:58,983
Is she still offering
the two-for-one discount?

340
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:02,069
DEA, huh? For a street bust.

341
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:05,406
Now, what would two feds
want with that little twerp?

342
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:21,463
Sooner or later,
this was gonna happen.

343
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:24,008
You want your exponential growth...

344
00:23:24,216 --> 00:23:26,260
...guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.

345
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:29,388
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?

346
00:23:29,597 --> 00:23:31,265
This is who he hires?

347
00:23:31,473 --> 00:23:34,476
What? Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.

348
00:23:35,894 --> 00:23:37,521
This is the guy I'd hire.

349
00:23:38,314 --> 00:23:39,690
It's the guy you'd hire.

350
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,233
Look, you remember Emilio?

351
00:23:41,692 --> 00:23:44,570
Okay, this dude got Emilio off,
like, twice. Okay?

352
00:23:44,778 --> 00:23:49,325
Both times, they had him
dead to rights, yo. And then, poof.

353
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:50,701
Dude is like Houdini.

354
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:52,703
Seriously,
when the going gets tough...

355
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:54,747
...you don't want a criminal lawyer.

356
00:23:54,955 --> 00:23:58,292
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

357
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,294
Know what I'm saying?

358
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:04,006
Look, we're in good shape,
Mr. White.

359
00:24:04,214 --> 00:24:06,467
Badger is way too loyal to roll.

360
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:08,636
Plus, he's scared shitless of me,
all right.

361
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:13,140
We pay four large. Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.

362
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:15,100
And it's only his first dealing rap...

363
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:17,895
...so, worst-case scenario,
you know, they plead him out.

364
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:21,649
He does five months picking up litter
in an orange jump suit.

365
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:26,820
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.

366
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:29,573
Well, I don't need them
seeing my face.

367
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:32,868
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.

368
00:24:33,077 --> 00:24:34,536
Dick.

369
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:36,246
Fine.

370
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,458
We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.

371
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:42,670
Heads.

372
00:24:55,516 --> 00:24:58,852
Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?

373
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:14,702
Mr. Mayhew.

374
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,871
Nice of you to come down. Please.

375
00:25:18,205 --> 00:25:19,331
Look at you.

376
00:25:19,748 --> 00:25:23,544
Should I call the FBI
and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?

377
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:24,920
Joking.

378
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:27,214
I-- Please, come on.

379
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:29,216
Come on. Please.

380
00:25:29,425 --> 00:25:31,218
Hello.

381
00:25:31,635 --> 00:25:34,597
Saul Goodman. Please sit.

382
00:25:37,224 --> 00:25:42,062
So it's a shame that we have to meet
under these circumstances.

383
00:25:46,442 --> 00:25:49,403
I believe you have
something for me?

384
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:51,739
Oh, yes.

385
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:58,704
- Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?
- Irish.

386
00:25:58,912 --> 00:26:01,749
Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.

387
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:04,335
My real name is McGill.

388
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,754
The Jew thing
I just do for the homeboys.

389
00:26:06,962 --> 00:26:11,008
They all want a pipe-hitting member
of the tribe, so to speak.

390
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:14,470
I digress.
Good things are happening.

391
00:26:14,678 --> 00:26:18,515
Fact is, your nephew is gonna
get out in no time.

392
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:20,351
That's wonderful, yeah.

393
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,937
There's still a few details
to be ironed out...

394
00:26:23,145 --> 00:26:25,105
...but now that the DEA
is involved...

395
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:29,026
...I think he's looking
at time served, then probation.

396
00:26:29,234 --> 00:26:32,613
So leave your number with Francesca,
and we'll be in touch.

397
00:26:32,821 --> 00:26:34,448
- Excuse me, the DEA?
- Yeah.

398
00:26:34,657 --> 00:26:38,243
That's the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The feds.

399
00:26:40,996 --> 00:26:43,457
I hope that I'm not
the breaker of bad news...

400
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:47,211
...but your nephew got mixed up
with some pretty nasty customers.

401
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:48,420
I understand that.

402
00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:50,339
What does that have
to do with the DEA?

403
00:26:50,547 --> 00:26:52,049
They're after some mystery man...

404
00:26:52,257 --> 00:26:54,718
...some heavy-hitter
that goes by the name Heisenberg.

405
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:57,346
They want this guy
like the axe wants the turkey.

406
00:26:57,554 --> 00:26:59,473
Seems young Brandon
may have information...

407
00:26:59,682 --> 00:27:01,517
...that could lead to his arrest.

408
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:04,061
Jesus, cheer up.
This is good news.

409
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,814
I mean, Brandon fell head-first
into the doo-doo pile...

410
00:27:07,022 --> 00:27:08,983
...and came up
smelling like Paco Rabanne.

411
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:13,320
Wait, wait. Look, I just... I think...

412
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:18,659
I just think that we should
review our options.

413
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:20,286
Options?

414
00:27:20,494 --> 00:27:22,496
I'm gonna tell you
what your options are.

415
00:27:22,705 --> 00:27:26,292
You got a grand total of two.
Option A: Brandon takes the deal.

416
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,669
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary...

417
00:27:28,877 --> 00:27:31,505
...and gets his rectum
resized about yay big.

418
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:35,342
Look, look. What about reprisals?

419
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:37,344
I mean, if Badger--

420
00:27:37,553 --> 00:27:43,017
If Brandon informs
on this Heisenberg...

421
00:27:43,517 --> 00:27:45,185
I mean, what if, God forbid...

422
00:27:45,394 --> 00:27:50,190
...that they decide to take revenge?

423
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,192
What have you been telling him?

424
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:55,821
The kid keeps spouting off about,
"If I talk, they'll kill me."

425
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,949
Right now, he's the only thing
holding up this deal.

426
00:27:59,908 --> 00:28:02,828
- Good.
- No, that's not good. That's terrible.

427
00:28:03,037 --> 00:28:06,123
Trust me, sir, your nephew
won't last in prison two weeks.

428
00:28:06,332 --> 00:28:09,001
You let him take his chances
on the outside.

429
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:11,170
Maybe I can work
in some witness protection.

430
00:28:11,378 --> 00:28:15,049
No, look, look.
These are vicious, desperate people.

431
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:20,220
I've been told that
one of them killed another man...

432
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:23,891
...by crushing his head
with an ATM machine.

433
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,561
People love to take credit
for the fun ones.

434
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,231
The guy who got his head smooshed
used to be a client of mine.

435
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,026
His wife killed him, all right?
It was open and shut.

436
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:36,737
Trust me, you folks have
nothing to worry about, okay?

437
00:28:36,946 --> 00:28:40,282
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,
get him singing like a canary...

438
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:42,910
...all's right with the world.

439
00:28:44,995 --> 00:28:47,122
Ten thousand dollars.

440
00:29:00,803 --> 00:29:03,597
Ten thousand, cash to you.

441
00:29:04,807 --> 00:29:08,477
I'm not saying to throw the case.

442
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:13,774
Just no talking to the DEA.

443
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:17,111
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

444
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:19,280
Yes.

445
00:29:20,155 --> 00:29:21,949
What's it going to be?

446
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:26,787
What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?

447
00:29:27,204 --> 00:29:29,957
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?

448
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:31,834
Yeah. "Morally outraged," he said.

449
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:33,460
Threatened to call the police.

450
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:38,632
<i>- Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
- Like the Exxon Valdez.</i>

451
00:29:39,675 --> 00:29:41,760
So, what do we do about it?

452
00:29:52,438 --> 00:29:54,481
Hey, Francesca,
how about I follow you home?

453
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,733
No.

454
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:57,610
For safety.

455
00:29:57,818 --> 00:29:59,361
What?

456
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:04,116
God, you are killing me
with that booty.

457
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:19,340
Talk to me.
Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?

458
00:30:19,548 --> 00:30:23,177
Come on, just tell me what you want.
Jesus!

459
00:30:24,428 --> 00:30:26,513
Oh, no, no, no!

460
00:30:26,722 --> 00:30:29,642
No, it wasn't me.
It was Ignacio. He's the one.

461
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,603
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

462
00:30:35,481 --> 00:30:37,358
Shut up, dude.

463
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:40,945
Shut up, all right?
Just speak English.

464
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:44,031
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?

465
00:30:44,573 --> 00:30:47,785
- Who?
- Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ!

466
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:50,537
Oh, I thought...

467
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:53,707
What can I do for you gentlemen?

468
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:56,335
Anything.
Just tell me what you need.

469
00:30:56,543 --> 00:31:00,631
This afternoon, an associate of ours
offered you $10,000.

470
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,383
You should have taken it.

471
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:05,678
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

472
00:31:05,886 --> 00:31:08,305
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

473
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:11,016
The uncle. That was your guy?

474
00:31:12,226 --> 00:31:14,979
No of fence, but I don't take bribes
from strangers, you know?

475
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:17,523
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.

476
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:22,152
- But I'll take your money! Sure!
- No, that offer has expired, yo.

477
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:26,282
It was kind of low anyways.
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

478
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,200
Just tell me what you need,
all right?

479
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:30,494
I'm easy. I'm gonna keep
a happy thought...

480
00:31:30,703 --> 00:31:32,997
...and assume
this is just a negotiating tactic.

481
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:36,250
All right, listen to me very carefully.

482
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,335
You are going to give
Badger Mayhew...

483
00:31:38,544 --> 00:31:41,672
...the best legal representation ever.

484
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,133
But no deals with the DEA.

485
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:48,012
All right? Badger will not identify
anyone to anybody.

486
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,764
If he does, you're dead.

487
00:31:52,808 --> 00:31:55,185
Why don't you just kill Badger?

488
00:31:58,188 --> 00:32:00,983
I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito
is buzzing around you...

489
00:32:01,191 --> 00:32:04,403
...and it bites you on the ass,
you don't go gunning for the attorney.

490
00:32:04,612 --> 00:32:08,032
You go grab a fly swatter.
I mean, so to speak.

491
00:32:08,449 --> 00:32:11,619
I mean, all due respect,
but do I have to spell this out for you?

492
00:32:12,202 --> 00:32:15,247
- We're not killing Badger, yo!
- Then you got real problems, okay.

493
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:17,458
Because the DEA
will come down on your boy...

494
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,585
...like a proverbial ton of bricks.

495
00:32:19,793 --> 00:32:21,879
I don't think
I'm going out on a limb here...

496
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:23,881
...but, hey,
he's not gonna like prison.

497
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:28,594
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion
regardless of what you do to me.

498
00:32:34,183 --> 00:32:35,476
Mr. Mayhew?

499
00:32:38,187 --> 00:32:41,815
I recognise your cough. Take that
mask off, you know. Get some air.

500
00:32:42,191 --> 00:32:43,692
Go on.

501
00:32:50,866 --> 00:32:52,493
- God.
- Take it easy.

502
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:55,329
Breathe in, breathe out.

503
00:32:55,537 --> 00:32:59,416
All right. I'm gonna stand up, all right?
Because I got bad knees.

504
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,002
That's better.

505
00:33:02,753 --> 00:33:06,340
Okay, now listen. The three of us
are gonna work this out.

506
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:08,050
Yeah? How?

507
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,011
First thing, you'll put a dollar
in my pocket, both of you.

508
00:33:13,847 --> 00:33:16,016
You want attorney-client privilege,
don't you?

509
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:19,270
So that everything you say
is strictly between us.

510
00:33:20,521 --> 00:33:22,356
I mean it. Put a dollar in my pocket.

511
00:33:22,564 --> 00:33:24,191
Come on, make it official.

512
00:33:25,192 --> 00:33:26,944
Come on, do it.

513
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:30,990
That's it, come on. Just a dollar.

514
00:33:35,202 --> 00:33:38,872
All right, now you, ski bum.
Come on. Give with the dollar.

515
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,582
- Go on.
- Be smart.

516
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,251
What?

517
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:47,715
- All I got is a five.
- I'll take a five.

518
00:33:47,923 --> 00:33:51,510
Come on, already.
Come on. Be cool.

519
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:55,931
Okay, you're now both
officially represented...

520
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,725
...by Saul Goodman and Associates.

521
00:33:57,933 --> 00:34:02,313
Your secrets are safe with me
under threat of disbarment. All right?

522
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:06,025
Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm
talking to the Weather Underground.

523
00:34:07,943 --> 00:34:09,903
Just do it.

524
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:17,911
Okay, so if a prison shanking
is completely off the table...

525
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,371
And we're sure of that?

526
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:23,500
No shanking!

527
00:34:25,502 --> 00:34:27,004
All right, all right.

528
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:32,051
The way I see it is
somebody is going to prison.

529
00:34:35,971 --> 00:34:37,848
It's just a matter of who.

530
00:34:39,308 --> 00:34:42,561
All right. Lame-ass TV ads aside...

531
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:46,273
...your lawyer here,
he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

532
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:47,733
Time served, no probation.

533
00:34:47,942 --> 00:34:51,278
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.

534
00:34:52,196 --> 00:34:54,573
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.

535
00:34:54,782 --> 00:34:56,825
You don't give us
the name of your supplier...

536
00:34:57,034 --> 00:35:00,245
- ...you're going nowhere.
- The tough guy act is unnecessary.

537
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:02,748
This young man
is cooperating fully.

538
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:05,876
Is that right?
Yeah, you cooperating?

539
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,716
Okay, let's start with a name.

540
00:35:15,177 --> 00:35:17,263
He just goes by Heisenberg.

541
00:35:17,805 --> 00:35:18,806
Heisenberg, huh?

542
00:35:20,182 --> 00:35:21,642
How old is this Heisenberg?

543
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:26,146
Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.

544
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:28,482
- Height?
- Average, I guess.

545
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:30,567
Medium height, medium weight.

546
00:35:30,776 --> 00:35:33,779
- What colour hair?
- No hair.

547
00:35:33,988 --> 00:35:35,614
Dude is balder than you.

548
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:40,286
1963, James Edward Kilkelly...

549
00:35:40,494 --> 00:35:42,997
...is convicted of stealing
a vending machine.

550
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:46,000
1975, breaking and entering.

551
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,836
1982, grand theft auto.

552
00:35:49,044 --> 00:35:51,380
1984, armed robbery.

553
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:55,926
1987, 1992. You get the idea.
And here he is today.

554
00:35:56,135 --> 00:35:58,012
Better known as Jimmy In-'N-Out.

555
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,726
City, state and federal, he's spent
44 of the last 58 years inside.

556
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:07,187
Entire life behind bars.

557
00:36:07,688 --> 00:36:09,940
Jimmy provides
a very special service.

558
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:12,985
For a price,
Jimmy will go to prison for you.

559
00:36:13,986 --> 00:36:17,698
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

560
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:20,534
He's actually
more comfortable inside.

561
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:23,162
The outside world
hasn't been too kind to him.

562
00:36:25,205 --> 00:36:27,207
Sometime during
the Clinton administration...

563
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:31,545
...Jimmy figured out how he could
use his talents to turn a profit.

564
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:40,846
- So when does all this happen?
- It's already happening.

565
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:42,348
The buy is set for tomorrow.

566
00:36:42,556 --> 00:36:45,225
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
everybody's happy...

567
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:48,437
...and all it's gonna cost you
is 80 thousand and one pound...

568
00:36:48,646 --> 00:36:50,147
...of your finest meth.

569
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:58,614
Eighty thousand dollars
for eight years of his life, huh?

570
00:36:58,822 --> 00:37:01,033
First of all,
he's not gonna do eight years.

571
00:37:01,241 --> 00:37:03,035
I'll represent him, and I guarantee...

572
00:37:03,243 --> 00:37:06,747
...there's gonna be some unexpected
problems with the prosecution's case.

573
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:09,583
Secondly, he gets 30.
Fifty goes to me.

574
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:12,836
- You get 50? For what?
- For facilitating.

575
00:37:13,045 --> 00:37:15,714
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.

576
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:17,925
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

577
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:21,220
Look, if this option
is too expensive...

578
00:37:21,428 --> 00:37:24,848
...you can still always... Badger
in the chow line.

579
00:37:43,158 --> 00:37:45,244
Conscience gets expensive,
doesn't it?

580
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:05,180
All right. There's our boy.

581
00:38:06,348 --> 00:38:08,642
Right on time.

582
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:28,329
- Go back.
- What? All right, all right, all right.

583
00:38:41,216 --> 00:38:44,845
So, what do you think?
They see us?

584
00:38:45,262 --> 00:38:47,139
No, man, I think we're good.

585
00:38:52,561 --> 00:38:54,647
Badger looks like
he's gonna throw up.

586
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:56,523
Give me those back.

587
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:58,692
Just give them to me.

588
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,153
Oh, no.

589
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:02,947
Where the hell is Jimmy?

590
00:39:03,155 --> 00:39:05,157
Should've been here
10 minutes ago.

591
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:10,079
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?

592
00:39:10,663 --> 00:39:12,665
There's more
than one kind of prison.

593
00:39:12,873 --> 00:39:14,708
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

594
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,378
There he is-- Wait a minute.

595
00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:21,131
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What? What? Let me see.

596
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:24,885
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know.

597
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:31,558
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.

598
00:39:32,601 --> 00:39:34,270
Time to move?

599
00:39:34,561 --> 00:39:36,605
Not till we see the exchange.

600
00:39:39,441 --> 00:39:42,444
No, no. Oh, shit!

601
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:45,739
- What?
- Now he shows.

602
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:51,161
Okay, let's do this.

603
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:56,667
No, no.

604
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:59,420
Oh, my God.
Jimmy is on the wrong bench. Crap!

605
00:39:59,628 --> 00:40:01,714
We're screwed!

606
00:40:01,922 --> 00:40:03,299
What are you doing?

607
00:40:03,507 --> 00:40:05,634
Hey, what are you doing?

608
00:40:09,722 --> 00:40:11,599
I don't get it. What's the holdup?

609
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:23,611
Where's the stuff, man?

610
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:25,946
- Where are we going?
- Just shut up.

611
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:33,037
Get out. Go stop him.

612
00:40:33,245 --> 00:40:35,664
The DEA is right there.
If they see me, we're screwed.

613
00:40:35,873 --> 00:40:37,374
Get out. I'll do something.

614
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:39,585
- What?
- Just go!

615
00:40:52,514 --> 00:40:54,642
Hank, I thought that was you.

616
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,435
Schrader, I'm blocked.

617
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:59,396
- Walt, not a good time.
- How you doing? You feeling okay?

618
00:40:59,605 --> 00:41:00,606
Schrader, I'm blocked.

619
00:41:01,315 --> 00:41:03,317
We're working.
You gotta get out of here.

620
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:06,862
- Working? Oh, like DEA working?
- Schrader, we're missing it. Schrader.

621
00:41:07,071 --> 00:41:09,114
Is something going down?

622
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:13,911
Wrong guy, wrong guy.
Other bench.

623
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:21,835
Walt, Walt.

624
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:24,171
- Walter, move your ass now.
- Okay.

625
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,173
Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone.

626
00:41:26,382 --> 00:41:29,176
- We'll talk about it later. Just floor it.
- Should I back up?

627
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:30,803
- Go that way.
- Forward is better?

628
00:41:31,011 --> 00:41:32,846
I'll be out of the way there.
Okay, okay.

629
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:35,516
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

630
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:38,310
- I'll leave you alone.
- We'll talk later. Just go.

631
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:41,939
Where'd he go?
Where the hell did he go?

632
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:47,152
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Got him.

633
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,787
- Looks like it's going down.
- Take him.

634
00:42:04,795 --> 00:42:07,798
Freeze! Hey, right there.
Don't move.

635
00:42:10,217 --> 00:42:11,635
Come on, let's get him up.

636
00:42:21,437 --> 00:42:23,105
Jesus!

637
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:25,941
I think they bought it.

638
00:42:29,695 --> 00:42:30,738
<i>Absolutely.</i>

639
00:42:30,946 --> 00:42:34,325
Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir.

640
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:37,077
Looks like we got a full pound
of the blue stuff.

641
00:42:37,286 --> 00:42:42,041
Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?
James Kilkelly.

642
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:47,421
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.

643
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:15,491
Hey.

644
00:43:16,492 --> 00:43:18,994
You weren't home,
so I let the delivery guys in.

645
00:43:19,203 --> 00:43:22,623
- I hope that's okay.
- Absolutely.

646
00:43:32,007 --> 00:43:34,176
So you bought a bed.

647
00:43:35,636 --> 00:43:36,762
Yeah.

648
00:43:37,346 --> 00:43:39,056
What is that, a king?

649
00:43:41,558 --> 00:43:43,143
Pillow top?

650
00:44:19,346 --> 00:44:23,267
Oh, my God.
You really are a chemistry teacher.

651
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,732
You mind?

652
00:44:33,819 --> 00:44:36,030
I was terrible at chemistry.

653
00:44:36,238 --> 00:44:38,866
I'm more of a humanities guy.

654
00:44:39,074 --> 00:44:41,660
- How did you find me?
- We should talk about that.

655
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:46,206
It should be much, much harder
for people to track you down.

656
00:44:46,415 --> 00:44:48,042
My Pl charged me for three hours...

657
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,211
...so I seriously doubt
it took him more than one.

658
00:44:54,131 --> 00:44:57,259
So this is, what, blackmail?

659
00:44:57,468 --> 00:44:59,178
Walter, I'm your lawyer.

660
00:44:59,386 --> 00:45:03,807
Anything you say to me
is totally privileged.

661
00:45:04,016 --> 00:45:06,560
I'm not in the shakedown racket.

662
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:09,188
I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers
need lawyers, right?

663
00:45:09,396 --> 00:45:12,524
Especially drug dealers.

664
00:45:12,942 --> 00:45:16,987
So, what, you're just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

665
00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:20,824
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?

666
00:45:22,117 --> 00:45:24,078
By the way,
where do you keep the money?

667
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:28,582
Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar
buried in the side yard?

668
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:31,752
This kid Mayhew may be the first
of your guys to get picked up...

669
00:45:31,961 --> 00:45:33,254
...but he won't be the last.

670
00:45:33,462 --> 00:45:37,007
And if I can find you,
how far behind can the cops be?

671
00:45:37,216 --> 00:45:38,634
I don't understand.

672
00:45:38,842 --> 00:45:41,720
What exactly are you
offering to do for me?

673
00:45:43,222 --> 00:45:46,267
What did Tom Hagen
do for Vito Corleone?

674
00:45:46,684 --> 00:45:49,770
I'm no Vito Corleone.

675
00:45:49,979 --> 00:45:52,731
No shit. Right now, you're Fredo.

676
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,441
But with some sound advice...

677
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:57,027
...and the proper introductions,
who knows?

678
00:45:57,236 --> 00:45:59,196
I'll tell you,
you've got the right product.

679
00:45:59,405 --> 00:46:02,157
Anything that gets the DEA's panties
in this big a bunch...

680
00:46:02,366 --> 00:46:04,034
...you're on to something special.

681
00:46:04,243 --> 00:46:08,622
And I would like to be
a small and silent part of it.

682
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:12,251
Food for thought, yeah?

683
00:46:17,464 --> 00:46:22,136
So if you wanna make more money
