1
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:47,422
So cigarettes and gas is $79.70.

2
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,883
Crap.

3
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,094
There's an ATM right outside.

4
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,681
Yeah, I don't have a card.

5
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,768
Well, you can write a personal check
with ID.

6
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,689
Kind of in between banks right now.

7
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,609
You think I could just
come back later?

8
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,821
I'm totally good for it.
I'd come back, I swear.

9
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,952
If it were me, I'd be totally,
you know, "No problem."

10
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,997
But my dad is
this ginormous hard-ass.

11
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,583
He was in Fallujah for a year.

12
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:27,295
And he always checks the receipts.
I mean, like, always.

13
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,589
I gotta call him. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,132
Wait, wait, wait.

15
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,510
Hold on a second.

16
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,972
Maybe we could...

17
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,641
...trade.

18
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,149
Ever try it?

19
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,112
I mean, I smoke pot a lot sometimes.

20
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,156
I party.

21
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,657
But...

22
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,869
- But that stuff's really addictive, right?
- Not really.

23
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,498
It's just a media thing. You know?

24
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:09,462
What's it like?

25
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,052
It's awesome.

26
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:23,017
Everything's maximum interesting.

27
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:30,399
You get these really cold
and sharp-like action dagger feelings.

28
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,863
It's awesome.

29
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,493
Come on. What do you say?

30
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,236
Have a nice day.

31
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,611
So how does it feel?

32
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,404
Does it hurt?

33
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,948
Yeah, it's tight.

34
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,452
- Yeah, but is it painful?
- It's hard to breathe.

35
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,955
Well, you need your breathing.

36
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,834
Although let's not lose sight
of the fact...

37
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,463
...that you were the victim
of a terrible accident, Antonio...

38
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,174
...so some discomfort is
to be expected.

39
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,682
Let's go with that one.

40
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,147
A cashier's check, por favor.

41
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:37,360
Oh, and spread the word.
I'm building a class-action, flight 515.

42
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,153
Victims' families would be great.

43
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,989
I'll take anyone on the ground
who suffered emotionally.

44
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,368
Anxiety, sleeplessness.
You get the picture.

45
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,953
Trouble?

46
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,498
Ted Beneke? You cannot be serious.

47
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:54,001
- That guy is a joke.
- You know what? You called my bluff.

48
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,461
What does that even mean?

49
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,798
You dared me to tell the police
and I couldn't do it, so you win.

50
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,385
If you want to stay in this house, fine,
but we are not married anymore.

51
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,972
I told you that
I was done cooking meth, Skyler.

52
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,682
- I promised you that.
- So what?

53
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,351
You know what?
At least I didn't run off to go...

54
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,813
Jesus! I mean, everything that I did,
I did for this family.

55
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,066
- Just keep telling yourself that.
- What is that supposed to mean?

56
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,985
You don't like it, then leave.

57
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,488
- And take your drug money with you.
- That's what you want.

58
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,827
- Jesus.
- Garbage disposal.

59
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,829
You think this will get me
to move out?

60
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,748
You can screw Ted. You can screw
the butcher, the mailman.

61
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,375
- God, Walt.
- Whoever you want.

62
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,253
Screw them all.
I'm not going anywhere.

63
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,213
Suit yourself.

64
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,008
Is this a good or bad thing?

65
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,720
Suit myself.
You want me to suit myself?

66
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,722
I'll suit myself to his face!

67
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,057
It's a bad thing.

68
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,403
Hello.

69
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,406
Walter White to see Ted Beneke.

70
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:09,577
I'm sorry.
Mr. Beneke's on a conference call.

71
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,581
Okay. I will wait.

72
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,708
It could be a while.

73
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,878
I have all the time in the world.

74
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,529
Okay.

75
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,283
- Here we go. Okay.
- Excuse me.

76
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,619
- Mr. Beneke's not available.
- Ted? Come on.

77
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,537
Sir, excuse me.

78
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,123
Excuse me.

79
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,958
Ted, I can see you.

80
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,628
I can see you standing right there
in your office.

81
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:01,837
Now, come on.

82
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:06,926
Open the door. Come on, let's talk.
I just want to talk. That's all.

83
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,678
Come on, let's be men about this.
Okay? How about that?

84
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,350
Hey, Walt. I'm kind of in the middle
of something now.

85
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,268
Oh, yes, you are.

86
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,145
So open the door.

87
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,648
You're damn right.
You're right in the middle.

88
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:23,317
Just open the door
and let's talk about it, okay?

89
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,653
Open the door, Ted, right now.

90
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:30,825
You don't want to be a man about it?
Plan B. How do you like that? Plan B.

91
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,828
We have a situation.

92
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,502
Walt. Walt. Walt.

93
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,963
What are you doing?

94
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,840
I'm talking with Ted.

95
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:01,564
Next time, you'll open the door.

96
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,401
- Freeze! Come on.
- Oh, damn it.

97
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,986
No, I'm just here to talk.

98
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,405
- I just want to talk to him.
- Outside. Let's go.

99
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,200
God. Can I just talk?
I just want to talk to him.

100
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,369
- Calm down.
- I'm just... Okay, all right.

101
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,831
All right, all right, all right.
I'm calm. I'm calm.

102
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,333
Asshole.

103
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,188
What do you want?
What do you want?

104
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,232
Hey! Hey, come on.

105
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,111
What the hell is wrong with you?

106
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,739
You act like you're the first guy
this happened to.

107
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:55,576
I caught my second wife screwing
my stepdad, okay?

108
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:59,038
It's a cruel world, Walt. Grow up.

109
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,250
- I just wanted to talk to him.
- Yeah, well, now I'm talking to you.

110
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,377
Consider this an intervention.

111
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,297
You could have been arrested
back there. You understand.

112
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,550
Speaking as your lawyer,
I'm always looking for billable hours.

113
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,928
But speaking as
your business associate...

114
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,931
...I'm strongly advising
that you get your shit together.

115
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:22,436
Just cool it with this Beneke guy,
at least for now. Okay?

116
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:27,441
Let's talk shop, because
I think this is a great opportunity...

117
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:31,320
...to channel some of that negative
energy into something positive.

118
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,573
- How did you know?
- Sorry?

119
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,284
About Skyler.
About where to find me just now.

120
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,453
How did you know?

121
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:43,499
That's just my meticulousness.
Don't bog down in detail, Walt.

122
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,794
- The lesson here should be...
- Did you bug my house?

123
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,509
Yeah, but I didn't know it was
your house, did I?

124
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,303
You'd moved out.
Besides, you basically told me to.

125
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,473
- I told you to?
- You strongly hinted that I should.

126
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,686
You were worried your wife might say
something to the police.

127
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:08,482
What? No, no, that's not true.
When the hell did I say that?

128
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,277
Let's not get lost in the who,
what and whens.

129
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,656
The point is we did our due diligence
and she didn't talk.

130
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,866
She kept quiet.
She stood by you, Walt...

131
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,996
...which, if you ask me,
is the ironical silver lining here.

132
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,998
I mean, on the one hand...

133
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:29,003
...sure, she snuck off the reservation
to get some dirty, damp and deep.

134
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,462
On the other hand...

135
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,891
Off me.

136
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,522
You're fired!

137
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,149
- You're done!
- Good!

138
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,067
"Oh, boohoo,
I won't cook meth anymore."

139
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,153
You're a crybaby. Who needs you?

140
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,031
I'm unplugging the website,
so no more money laundering.

141
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,198
How do you like that?

142
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,076
I want those bugs
out of my house today.

143
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,537
I want them out now!

144
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,499
You just bought a $300 suit, psycho!

145
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,502
Go.

146
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,886
Great, drilled right into the stucco.

147
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,224
A little bit of putty, you'll be fine.

148
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,437
Just make sure
you get all of those things.

149
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,941
A, these things cost $800 apiece.

150
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,693
B, you're not that interesting.

151
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,905
So yeah, I'll get all of them, Walter.

152
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,577
Great line of work, by the way.
Real upstanding field.

153
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,621
Yeah, well...

154
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,375
...I enjoy it.

155
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,428
You're free to leave now. Anytime.

156
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,766
You know, Walter...

157
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,270
...sometimes it doesn't hurt
to have someone watching your back.

158
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,934
Mr. White?

159
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,066
Hi.

160
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,653
What's up?

161
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:49,578
I can't begin to understand
what you're going through, Walt...

162
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:54,750
...with all of your health concerns
and the stresses you've been under.

163
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,543
But still, as educators...

164
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,756
...there are certain responsibilities
we need to be meeting here...

165
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,717
...to the school
and to the students themselves.

166
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,469
Of course.

167
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,265
Is this a wheaten terrier?

168
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,894
Norfolk.

169
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,896
Norfolk?

170
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,565
That's surprising.

171
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,403
Walt, could you come back over here
and have a seat, please?

172
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,739
Sure.

173
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,087
You've been absent a lot recently.

174
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:45,384
And when you are here at school, there
have been some behavioral questions.

175
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,053
And frankly I'm concerned.

176
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,558
Thank you.

177
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,235
Are you feeling okay?

178
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,447
Do you think maybe
I should call Skyler?

179
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,326
No.

180
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:21,003
Let's just keep this...

181
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,838
What...?

182
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,592
Hey!

183
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,095
Walt, what's wrong with you?

184
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:15,515
You know, look, you're the one
always talking about D.C., okay?

185
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,351
This is how you get there.

186
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,520
You answer the bell.
You pay your dues.

187
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:28,195
Besides, you know,
it's a big deal to get picked for this.

188
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,367
El Paso's like the Super Bowl.

189
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,704
I could get killed crossing the street,
okay?

190
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:41,124
Whatever. You know, I want to go.

191
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,754
What about last time?

192
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,445
Schrader.

193
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,532
Hey, sheriff. Yeah.

194
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,035
Blue, huh?

195
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,290
Yeah, yeah. Thing is...

196
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,086
Thing is I'm supposed to be getting
on a plane right now.

197
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,094
The stuff this guy had was blue.
You sure about that?

198
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,765
Yeah.

199
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,768
Yeah, I want to talk to him.

200
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,440
Taxi.

201
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,773
- Hi.
- Man, I'm sorry.

202
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,276
I needed to talk to you,
but you weren't at your apartment.

203
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,820
No, I moved back home.

204
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:35,989
That's good, right?

205
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,158
Yeah.

206
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,495
- Yo, did you just get fired?
- No.

207
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,164
No, no, no.

208
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,750
It's more like a sabbatical.

209
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,836
Indefinite. Yeah.

210
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,020
So, what's up?

211
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,689
Should we go somewhere?

212
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,068
No, this is fine.

213
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,990
So I want an intro to your guy.

214
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,575
What guy?

215
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,163
Your guy. Your distribution guy.
The guy Saul hooked you up with.

216
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,499
No, no, no. Come on, Jesse.

217
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:32,212
- I thought about it and I want to.
- God.

218
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,172
It's the one thing I'm good at.

219
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,050
No, that is just not true.

220
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,761
You're good at a lot of things, son.

221
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,346
Like what?

222
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,434
What about your sobriety?

223
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,688
I told you, I'm not using.

224
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,731
Ever.

225
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,610
I just want back into the business.

226
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,118
Well, I don't. I'm sorry.

227
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,453
I know, and that's cool.

228
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,249
I'm not asking you to cook.

229
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,253
What's this?

230
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:18,258
In the end, I just went with
two reflux condensers.

231
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,927
I didn't want to lose track
of my pH levels.

232
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:25,098
But I did everything else
just like you taught me.

233
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,768
Super careful in my amounts...

234
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,439
...and watched the numbers
every step of the way.

235
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,860
So, what do you think?
It's good, right?

236
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:44,784
What in the hell is this?

237
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,162
- What?
- What?

238
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,832
This. This. This is my product.

239
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,501
This is my formula. This is mine.

240
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:58,006
It's our product,
but yeah, I was gonna cut you in.

241
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,883
Oh, you were gonna cut me in?

242
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,469
No, no, no. I cut you in.

243
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:06,473
What the hell is your problem?
All I'm asking is for you to set a meet.

244
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,601
- Absolutely not.
- Why?

245
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,606
Because I am not gonna lend my name
to an inferior product.

246
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,150
I mean, look at the diameters here.

247
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,110
What did you use for reduction?

248
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,155
Don't tell me. Platinum dioxide, right?

249
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,492
No. Mercury-aluminum amalgam.

250
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,827
The dioxide's too hard to keep wet.

251
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,289
All right, well,
you must've done it wrong, then.

252
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:35,293
Your color is all cloudy, so you were
struggling with distillation too.

253
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,171
Now, this is very shoddy work,
Pinkman.

254
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,340
I'm actually embarrassed for you.

255
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,133
What?

256
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,846
No way. I gave out samples
and everyone said it was the bomb.

257
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,475
Oh, they said it was the bomb.

258
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,645
And who were they, I wonder?
A bunch of meth heads?

259
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,854
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

260
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,691
- They should know, right?
- Yeah, well, sorry.

261
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,193
- I can't help you.
- Fine, ass-wad.

262
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,363
- I'll contact the guy myself.
- Oh, yeah? Well, good luck.

263
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,866
Because my guy is a pro
and he doesn't deal with junkies.

264
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,744
- You know what? Eat me.
- Anytime, loser.

265
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,037
Hey, hey, hey!

266
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:14,249
Wait. Hey!

267
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,999
I can't believe it's only 4:00.

268
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,420
This day is dragging.

269
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,764
Okay.

270
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,959
I wish I could stay.

271
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,754
So stay.

272
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,675
What's stopping you?

273
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,264
What, like everything, you mean?

274
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:57,477
How about my lunatic husband
refusing to leave the house?

275
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,940
So move in here.

276
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:07,821
And then my son hating me
even more.

277
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,783
That'll pass.
I went through that with the girls.

278
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,368
They adapt.

279
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:18,331
And now everyone at work thinks
I'm an evil ladder-climbing whore.

280
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,209
They're all fired,
effective immediately.

281
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,002
What else?

282
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,465
Oh, aren't you the answer man?

283
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,680
Where did it...?

284
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,811
Where did it go wrong, exactly,
with you and Walt?

285
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,485
I mean, I always saw him as kind of...

286
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,031
...mild-mannered.

287
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,911
Something, I don't know,
change when he got sick or?

288
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,665
I don't know what changed, Ted.

289
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,003
And I just don't feel really comfortable
talking about it.

290
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,130
Sorry.

291
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,550
Just asking out of self-interest.

292
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:13,386
Gotta make sure
I don't make the same mistake.

293
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,682
I would be amazed.

294
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,021
Just let me see if
I'm following you here, Russell.

295
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:27,942
You got this stuff from some guy
at Gasparza's...

296
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,944
...who was wearing tan pants...

297
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:34,282
...and who you're 80 percent sure
had a mustache.

298
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,909
That's it, right?

299
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,913
That's your brain
working at maximum capacity?

300
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,421
Russell.

301
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,758
Everything all right in there?

302
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,679
Mel. The dude's name was Mel.

303
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:01,309
Well, there you go. See?
You served an actual earthly function.

304
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,394
I can't believe I remembered that.

305
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:07,607
Mel who?
Does he have a last name?

306
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,984
Yeah, Mel.

307
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,071
Wait.

308
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,698
Was it Mel...

309
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,284
...or Mark?

310
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,496
It was definitely an M name.

311
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,790
Oh, man, I'm losing it.

312
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,459
Wait, wait.

313
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,129
Yeah.

314
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,634
It's gone.

315
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,095
- It was an M name though.
- Yeah.

316
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,139
I remember the... sound.

317
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:46,145
All right, well,
we'll go with the... sound.

318
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,981
- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

319
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,233
He definitely had tan pants.

320
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,363
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

321
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,283
Okay, it's after 9,
so this bar that Girl George is at...

322
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,368
...probably wall-to-wall dirtbags
by now.

323
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:05,999
Let's go have a little looky-loo,
see if we can't find this M-named clown.

324
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:12,005
What? It's a lead.

325
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,008
- Lead to what?
- To Heisenberg.

326
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,636
I told you it was only a matter of time
before this guy booted up again.

327
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,722
Here we go, my friend.

328
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,974
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful,
Gomey.

329
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:26,060
Just apologize and buy me a beer.

330
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:29,147
Man, you're reaching.

331
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:33,401
This stuff could be a knockoff
or left over from an older cook.

332
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,195
How do you know Heisenberg's
gearing up again?

333
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,990
How do I know?

334
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,868
Because I know.

335
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,411
I don't get it.

336
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,914
This is the reason why
you're blowing off the task force?

337
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,000
Chase down teeners?

338
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,837
I'm getting tired
of all the second-guessing.

339
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,716
If you're not sufficiently stimulated
by this investigation...

340
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,177
...do us both a favor
and ask for a transfer.

341
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,721
What is up with you lately?

342
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:05,600
Starting bar fights,
turning down El Paso...

343
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,185
...and now this bullshit?

344
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,313
Do you need to talk to someone
or what?

345
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,732
Talk to someone?

346
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,193
Talk to who?

347
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:22,575
I'm not trying to step on your toes,
bro. Okay?

348
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,411
I'm just worried about you.
That's all.

349
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,915
Appreciate that, bro.

350
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,335
Now take your hand off my shoulder.

351
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,768
Yeah, yeah, the one that was on TV.

352
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,938
Did any little piece
fall on your property?

353
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:55,108
I'm not looking for an entire wing here,
Mr. Linkas.

354
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,319
It could be a nut or a bolt.
It could be a bag of peanuts...

355
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,656
...just so long as it caused you
pain and suffering.

356
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,409
Oh, no, no, no. Closed.
Calling you back.

357
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,829
You had your chance.
I told you to get him cooking again.

358
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,916
You blew it off and now it's too late.
The guy's gone mass maniac on us!

359
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,419
All I wanted was to show you two
your potential.

360
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,838
And what do I get in return?
A bone contusion.

361
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,383
You wanna see the scar?
I wish you two had...

362
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,260
Hi, there.

363
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,014
- How in the hell did you get Walt to...?
- I made it.

364
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,476
You know the guy
who knows the guy, right?

365
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,344
Well, good news is...

366
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:09,849
...for a stage-three cancer,
the guy's doing well physically.

367
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,143
Mentally, the guy's a disaster.

368
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,855
He's gone off the rails
over this thing with his wife.

369
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:20,985
My opinion, he's not coming back.
Not on his own.

370
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,700
Your friends were at his place again,
by the way.

371
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:31,037
They drew something on the street
outside his house.

372
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:35,249
- The scythe.
- Animals.

373
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,084
- Does the lawyer know?
- Should he?

374
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,878
No.

375
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:45,051
If you want this guy to produce again,
why not just tell him?

376
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,595
You stand between him
and an ax in the head.

377
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,348
I don't believe fear
to be an effective motivator.

378
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,391
I want investment.

379
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:56,229
For now, I'm simply interested
in time frame.

380
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,357
He will live for the foreseeable future,
yes?

381
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:05,112
Foreseeable. Couple years at least,
barring acts of God and men with axes.

382
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,908
From the lawyer,
I'm supposed to let you know...

383
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,786
...the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.

384
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:15,581
- I don't work with junkies.
- That's what I thought you'd say.

385
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,583
Probably for the best.

386
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,086
What I hear,
he and Walter are splitsville.

387
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,256
Really?

388
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,884
That's what Goodman says.
Cats and dogs.

389
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,097
Do the deal.

390
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,479
You have one unheard message.

391
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:05,399
Agent Schrader, you need
to be calling me back ASAP.

392
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:09,236
I've got Texas breathing down
my neck and I'm not about...

393
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,553
No, I haven't seen Matt since my dad
fired him, like, a while ago.

394
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,597
Where can I find him, you think?

395
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,767
- No idea. Haven't seen him.
- I know. You said that a few times.

396
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:44,563
Yeah, because I haven't seen him.
I don't know what else to say.

397
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:51,904
- What's your name, darling?
- Cara.

398
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,371
Where did this come from, Cara?

399
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,416
I don't know.

400
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,585
What is it? Drugs?

401
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:12,216
Look, I'm just gonna come right out
and say it.

402
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,261
You're a bad liar, Cara.

403
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,807
Don't get me wrong.
Not the worst I've ever seen.

404
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:24,937
Once had a guy try to explain the dope
balloon up his butt on bad Thai food.

405
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:30,192
Still, you're not a very good liar.

406
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,946
- I honestly don't know...
- Stop.

407
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:37,283
You look like a good kid.
I'm not here to get you in trouble.

408
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:41,328
But you need to tell me
where this came from right now!

409
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:49,462
I never do stuff like this.
I swear to God.

410
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,965
I tried it and I hated it,
so I just gave it to Matt.

411
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,134
- Okay, and who gave it to you?
- Some guy.

412
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:59,430
He came in a couple days ago
and wanted to trade it for gas.

413
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,641
Some guy? What's his name?

414
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:07,104
Okay, what...? What did he look like?

415
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,858
I don't know.

416
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,027
He looked pretty normal.

417
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,654
You know, white.

418
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,661
I think his hair was lightish brown.

419
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,831
He had really blue eyes.

420
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,334
They were really, really blue.

421
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:31,295
Yeah, yeah, yeah, dreamy.
Okay, what else?

422
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:36,383
Piercings, jewelry, distinctive
articles of clothing. Come on.

423
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,011
Come on.

424
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,014
Listen to me.

425
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:46,018
It's real important that I find the person
that had these drugs.

426
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,522
So if you can remember
anything else...

427
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:55,778
Come on, think.
Come on, now. Come on.

428
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,281
He drove an RV.

429
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,492
Okay, good, good.

430
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,869
What can you remember?
What kind of RV?

431
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,914
What color?
Did you spot a license plate?

432
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:12,711
I don't know the kinds
and I didn't see the license.

433
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:18,884
But the color was,
I think, white, brownish color.

434
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,680
I'm sorry.

435
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,057
I know I'm not helping you...

436
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,687
...but, please, don't tell my dad.

437
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,614
Cara.

438
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:47,329
Please, tell me that
that camera works.

439
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,386
Damn it.

440
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,986
Bingo.

441
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,342
These eggs are good, Mom.

442
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,344
Thanks.

443
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,683
Hey, you know what's weird?
Dad's website.

444
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,686
It's been three days
since the last donation.

445
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:41,318
Yeah, well, people lose interest.

446
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,168
So how long are you off for?

447
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,091
A few weeks.

448
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:07,094
I'll play it by ear.

449
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:15,894
I probably pushed it, you know,
going back to work too soon.

450
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:29,408
Think I can get a ride today?
Louis has a doctor's appointment.

451
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,912
Yeah.

452
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:43,088
Hey, so, Dad can babysit now, right?

453
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:48,093
You won't have to take Holly
to work every day.

454
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,396
Sometime, maybe.

455
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,233
Yeah, we'll see.

456
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,319
What's up?

457
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,952
I think you'll seriously enjoy, yo.

458
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:15,347
Wait. No, no. No way.

459
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:20,853
Hey! Hey!

460
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:26,066
Hey. What the hell? This is only half.

461
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,027
That's right. It's your half.

462
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:35,826
Yo, where's the other half, bitch?

463
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:41,165
I mean, the whole thing was crazy.
Poor bastard. I felt sorry for him.

464
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:45,252
I think he actually thought
we were the cable guys, you know.

465
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:51,008
Anyway, sorry about
those missed calls, chief.

466
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,343
I'm changing providers.
It won't happen again.

467
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,389
Are you going to El Paso, Hank?

468
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,893
Hell, yes.
With pointy boots and bells on.

469
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,895
Got this break in the Heisenberg case.

470
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,023
The blue meth, you mean?
The teenth?

471
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,734
Yeah, well,
that teenth got things rolling.

472
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:12,237
I traced it to a gas station in Cibola.
That's where I got these.

473
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:16,074
The station's closed-circuit was down...
Surprise, surprise.

474
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:21,205
- But I was able to pull some of these
snapshots off an ATM security camera.

475
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,874
We always thought these guys
might be camper-cooking.

476
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,543
First off, your typical Class C
motor home...

477
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,588
...is gonna grunt at least 5000 pounds
of interior fixtures.

478
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:33,425
Appliances, furniture, built-ins,
5000 pounds at least, okay?

479
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,220
See how high
that suspension's riding?

480
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,932
No way, no how, this thing's carrying
that kind of weight.

481
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,936
This thing has been cleared out and
stripped down to its tight-and-curlies.

482
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,481
For what? Blood bank?

483
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,775
Maybe a bookmobile?

484
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,779
There's no clear view of the plates.

485
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:56,281
Yeah, well, you can only get
so lucky, right?

486
00:42:56,449 --> 00:43:00,118
But there's no front plate. Tells me
it's likely New Mexico registration.

487
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,411
I check with DMV.

488
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,958
There are only 29 of these early-'80s
Bounders registered in the state.

489
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,255
- Only 29?
- Yeah.

490
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,716
So I gotta go, you know,
knock on some doors.

491
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,226
They need you in El Paso, Hank.

492
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,146
You bet. I'm just gonna wrap up
this Heisenberg thing first.

493
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,774
- You're refusing the assignment.
- I'm not. I'll go.

494
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,818
It's just I need some more time.

495
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:35,821
You're not hearing me,
Agent Schrader.

496
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,864
You're out of time.

497
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:43,495
Are you going to El Paso now,
tonight?

498
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,876
It's a simple yes or no.

499
00:43:56,509 --> 00:44:01,179
No. I can't.

500
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:09,354
But that's only because
I'm really close to something big here.

501
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,700
Better get to it, then.

502
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,062
This is KECA 480,
Albuquerque's news radio.

503
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,397
KECA news time, 10:13.

504
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:55,025
Our top story this hour,
Donald Margolis...

505
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:59,196
...the air-traffic controller criticized
for his role in the recent air disaster...

506
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,406
...in which 167 persons died...

507
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:04,201
...was rushed to an area hospital
early this morning...

508
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:07,204
...apparently the victim of
a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

509
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:09,915
Police won't say whether or not...

510
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,465
Your half.

511
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,272
Okay, okay.
