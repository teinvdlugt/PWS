1
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:41,944
- Yo.
- Yo.

2
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:43,404
What up?

3
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:44,739
Damn, bitch.

4
00:00:49,577 --> 00:00:53,372
- You got something for me?
- Yeah. Yeah, I found them.

5
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:01,506
- Is this a five or an S?
- Five, yo.

6
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:03,591
No, wait. S.

7
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:07,678
- No, no. Yeah, five.
- Yeah?

8
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:12,850
Jesus, how the hell do you spell
"street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?

9
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:14,101
Hey, man.

10
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,355
I'm slinging mad volume
and fat stacking Benjies.

11
00:01:17,563 --> 00:01:20,316
I can't be all about,
like, spelling and shit.

12
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:22,026
Hey.

13
00:01:22,235 --> 00:01:23,945
So they got names?

14
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:28,407
Hers is, like, I don't know.
She's just his woman is all.

15
00:01:28,616 --> 00:01:30,493
Him, they call Spooge.

16
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:35,915
Spooge?
Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?

17
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:38,042
Let me get this straight.
You got jacked...

18
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:40,211
...by a guy named Spooge?

19
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:42,046
Yo, what's his name matter?

20
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:45,842
All's I saw was that knife
he stuck in my face, like that big.

21
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,678
If you're looking for a reason
not to go do this thing...

22
00:01:48,886 --> 00:01:51,055
- Did I say that?
- Because I'll go do it myself.

23
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:55,560
- It's just I'm on probation and all.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:58,437
So you gonna do it?

25
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:00,940
Yeah.

26
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:03,401
Good. Right on.

27
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:09,824
Because these two,
they need to get got.

28
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:43,209
Where's my money, bitch?
Where's my money?

29
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:45,294
Where's my--?

30
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:50,341
Where's my money, bitch?
Huh, bitch?

31
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,678
Where's my money, bitch?
Oh, that's good.

32
00:03:53,886 --> 00:03:55,471
Where's my money?

33
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,099
Where's my money, bitch?
Bitch, where's my money?

34
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:00,434
Come on.

35
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:07,275
I will mess you up.

36
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:10,444
That how you wanna play this?
Your call.

37
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:13,197
Your funeral, jack.

38
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:19,203
Hey, do not mess with me.
I will bury you because I'm crazy, yo.

39
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:22,206
<i>Yeah, mucho loco.</i>

40
00:04:22,415 --> 00:04:25,543
Do not test me.

41
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:37,680
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

42
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,641
Honey, you blocking the mailbox.

43
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:44,145
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

44
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:46,939
Looks like it's gonna be
a nice day, huh?

45
00:04:47,148 --> 00:04:50,193
Yeah. Yeah. High 70s.

46
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:54,530
- You have a great day.
- Right on. You too.

47
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:13,216
God. Shit.

48
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,418
Yo, anybody home?

49
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:55,258
Hello?

50
00:06:50,646 --> 00:06:56,611
<i>Tonight, you will receive
the ultimate mixture of cutlery...</i>

51
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,071
<i>...tonight in the steel knock out.</i>

52
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,200
<i>Every phone line jammed.
Eighty-nine dollars on flex pay.</i>

53
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:04,744
<i>That's 15 easy instalments.</i>

54
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:07,955
<i>And, folks, the knock out is only--</i>

55
00:07:08,164 --> 00:07:10,917
Hey, yo, is anybody else home?

56
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,711
<i>Now, Terry put this one together--</i>

57
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,506
Where's your folks? They here?

58
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:18,633
<i>--And I'm here to tell you--</i>

59
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:24,013
<i>Yeah, guys,
you might wanna put up like a...</i>

60
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:26,057
<i>Already done it.</i>

61
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:28,392
<i>Tonight, folks...</i>

62
00:07:36,776 --> 00:07:38,736
<i>Do you realise how long it's been...</i>

63
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:43,533
<i>...since we've offered this sword
in this set?</i>

64
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:50,081
<i>Much less the watashi and tanto
as a bonus in the deal.</i>

65
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:51,958
<i>It's no wonder--</i>

66
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,253
<i>It is no wonder so many of you
are on the line right now--</i>

67
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:56,587
What's your name?

68
00:07:56,796 --> 00:08:00,091
<i>I'm gonna count this as one.
Even though there are three, I'm--</i>

69
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:03,761
My name's Diesel.

70
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,930
<i>--Eleven, 12, 13--</i>

71
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:10,268
<i>--sixteen, 17, 18, 19...</i>

72
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:13,020
Yo, don't you wanna watch
something other than this?

73
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:16,858
<i>Like, I don't know, Mister Rogers'?</i>

74
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:21,237
<i>Imagine this plan,
this set in your own home.</i>

75
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:24,407
<i>Folks, custom pieces--</i>

76
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:34,041
<i>Well, needless to say,
I've made a pretty good mess...</i>

77
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,502
<i>...but there's a reason for that.</i>

78
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:41,966
<i>Just because these are under $10,
don't let anybody kid you.</i>

79
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:45,803
<i>These knives possess edges like...</i>

80
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:58,900
So when are your folks
coming home?

81
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:03,488
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?
When is he getting back?

82
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,326
I'm hungry.

83
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:15,500
<i>Hey there, you three.</i>

84
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,503
<i>Just wanted to wish Walt
a good first day back.</i>

85
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:23,674
<i>We'll be thinking about you
teaching valences and covalences...</i>

86
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:27,011
<i>Okay, that's all I officially
remembered. Good luck.</i>

87
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,056
<i>Skyler, give me a call
when you get a chance.</i>

88
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:36,103
<i>Hi, Walt and Skyler.
This is Gretchen Schwartz...</i>

89
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:38,356
<i>...calling to say hello.</i>

90
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:41,692
<i>I'm down from Santa Fe today
and I was thinking about you both...</i>

91
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:43,152
<i>...hoping everything's well.</i>

92
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:46,447
<i>I tried Walt's cell, and it said
the number had been disconnected...</i>

93
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:49,158
<i>...so I'm just hoping
that everything's okay.</i>

94
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:51,536
<i>Call me if you can,
whenever's convenient.</i>

95
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:56,374
<i>- Hello?
- Oh, hi, Gretchen.</i>

96
00:09:56,582 --> 00:10:00,044
<i>This is Skyler White.
Am I catching you at a bad time?</i>

97
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:02,380
No. No, not at all.

98
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:05,049
It's so good to hear from you.
How is everybody?

99
00:10:05,258 --> 00:10:06,634
<i>We're very well, thank you.</i>

100
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,347
Walt is actually at work today.
It's his first day back at work...

101
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:14,892
<i>...and he lost his cell phone
quite a while back.</i>

102
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:16,978
And I really hope
we didn't worry you.

103
00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:20,147
No, no. I'm just so glad to hear
that everybody's fine.

104
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:21,732
That's wonderful.

105
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:26,779
Gretchen, I'm so very,
very long overdue in telling you this...

106
00:10:26,988 --> 00:10:30,908
...and I have to take Walt at his word
that he's been passing it along for me.

107
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:33,369
<i>I mean, he's been so adamant...</i>

108
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:37,248
...about wanting to handle this
whole thing by himself, and...

109
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:40,251
But I have picked up the phone
about a hundred times. I just--

110
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:45,882
<i>- What? What is it?
- I can't...</i>

111
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,594
...begin to thank you and Elliott
for what you've done.

112
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:54,056
<i>The money for Walt's treatment,
it's just...</i>

113
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:57,894
It saved us.

114
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:02,982
I don't know if I...

115
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:05,943
Walt keeps saying,
"Don't bother them. It's no big deal."

116
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:08,362
But it is a big deal. Yeah.

117
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:12,033
To me. And to all of us.

118
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,911
So I just...

119
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:19,373
...finally wanted to say thank you.

120
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:25,379
<i>Anyway...</i>

121
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:28,007
End of speech.

122
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:30,885
So I do--
I hope we get to see you soon.

123
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:35,973
Truly, anytime you're in town,
anytime at all, is good for us.

124
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:41,020
<i>- How about this afternoon?
- Yeah, okay.</i>

125
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,318
Monoalkenes, diolefins...

126
00:11:47,527 --> 00:11:51,113
...trienes, polyenes.

127
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:54,784
I mean, the nomenclature alone
is enough to make your head spin.

128
00:11:54,992 --> 00:11:57,036
But when you start
to feel overwhelmed...

129
00:11:57,245 --> 00:11:59,497
...and you will...

130
00:11:59,705 --> 00:12:03,835
...just keep in mind
that one element...

131
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:06,295
...carbon.

132
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:10,007
Carbon is at the centre of it all.

133
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:13,970
There is no life without carbon.

134
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:16,681
Nowhere that we know of
in the universe.

135
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:23,813
Everything that lives, lived,
will live, carbon.

136
00:12:25,648 --> 00:12:26,649
Carmen is carbon.

137
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:31,821
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.
Did you...?

138
00:12:33,156 --> 00:12:35,032
No. Okay.

139
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:38,661
I like to think of it...

140
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:43,166
I like to think that the diamond...

141
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:45,418
...and the woman
who wears it on her finger...

142
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:48,838
...are both formed
from the same stuff.

143
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:55,011
Or, say, the diamond
and the man who invented it.

144
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:58,556
That got your attention, right?

145
00:12:58,764 --> 00:13:02,476
The man who invented the diamond.
All right.

146
00:13:03,811 --> 00:13:07,773
H. Tracy Hall.
Write this name down.

147
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:12,904
Dr. Hall invented
the first reproducible process...

148
00:13:13,112 --> 00:13:15,531
...for making synthetic diamonds.

149
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,909
I mean, this is way back in the '50s.

150
00:13:18,117 --> 00:13:23,289
Now, today, synthetic diamonds
are used in oil drilling...

151
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:28,211
...electronics,
multi-billion-dollar industries.

152
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:32,006
At the time, Dr. Hall
worked for General Electric.

153
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:37,178
And he made them a fortune.
I mean, incalculable.

154
00:13:40,097 --> 00:13:44,602
You wanna know
how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?

155
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:50,107
A $10 U.S. Savings Bond.

156
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:03,246
Anyway...

157
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:07,583
A savings bond
printed on carbon-based paper...

158
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,335
...paid to a carbon-based man...

159
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:15,216
...for something
he made out of carbon.

160
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:18,928
<i>It's so nice to have you back with us.</i>

161
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:22,974
You're looking great, by the way.

162
00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:27,687
A little skinnier,
which is definitely no tragedy.

163
00:14:27,895 --> 00:14:31,149
- And then there's the hair thing.
- I actually like that.

164
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:33,651
That's a great look for you.

165
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:41,075
- But you're feeling good?
- Oh, absolutely. Hundred percent.

166
00:14:41,284 --> 00:14:43,452
It's...

167
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:45,121
I'm glad to be back at work.

168
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:50,209
I'm glad to... You know,
I'm happy to be here. Really.

169
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:52,420
We're happy too.

170
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:56,299
And I just...

171
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:02,471
Yeah. It's good. It's great.

172
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:09,520
Is everything okay?

173
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:15,902
Just please feel comfortable
coming to me...

174
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:20,865
...with any problems, any issues.
Anything at all.

175
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:23,993
You know, completely confidential.

176
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:26,120
Okay?

177
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:33,377
- See you tomorrow, Flynn.
- See you, Jeffrey.

178
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:37,131
Oh, man.

179
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,562
Let me see it.

180
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:56,651
- Dad, let me see it.
- Don't worry about it.

181
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,199
Hey, let's go.

182
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:39,277
<i>Forty-eight dollars,
that's the original price...</i>

183
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:42,613
Hey.

184
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:46,742
Peekaboo.

185
00:16:51,205 --> 00:16:52,290
No?

186
00:16:57,295 --> 00:16:58,713
Peekaboo.

187
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:04,302
Oh, man.

188
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:09,473
Oh, my hand is cramping up!

189
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:14,562
Oh, my God. Here, here, here.

190
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:18,149
Now, I don't know.
If you want your hand to stop aching...

191
00:17:18,357 --> 00:17:21,235
...I gave you advice,
take it or leave it.

192
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:29,452
Okay, you stay right here, all right?
Okay? I mean it.

193
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:44,425
- Shut up!
- You shut up.

194
00:17:44,634 --> 00:17:47,053
- You shut up, you--
- You shut up!

195
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:49,972
- You're the one who dropped it.
- I didn't drop it.

196
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:51,182
I didn't drop--

197
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,601
- Shit! You dropped it.
- Shut the hell up about it.

198
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:55,186
- You shut up!
- You shut up.

199
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:00,858
Get up.

200
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:06,531
Shut up. Shut up! Both of you.

201
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:30,179
- You know who might have done it?
- I have an idea.

202
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:35,560
Well, here's what I think.

203
00:18:35,768 --> 00:18:40,231
You ID them, and then together,
you and I put a bag over their heads...

204
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:45,611
...we tie them up, drive them way out
into the desert, strip them naked...

205
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,200
...then bury them up to their necks
in a huge mound of fire ants.

206
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,871
Saw it in an old Western.

207
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,959
You with me?

208
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,089
Scorpions?

209
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:10,261
Scorpions are good.

210
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:12,555
Yeah.

211
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:21,439
Nice.

212
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,123
Damn, Dad. Check it out.

213
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:41,918
Who is this?

214
00:20:00,937 --> 00:20:03,815
So this is Walter Jr., or Flynn.

215
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:06,150
He likes to go by Flynn these days.

216
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,736
- Mom.
- What? I'm just offering the choice.

217
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:11,447
This is Mrs. Schwartz,
whom you've heard so much about.

218
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:14,617
- Very nice to meet you, Flynn.
- Nice to meet you too.

219
00:20:14,826 --> 00:20:15,993
Oh, Walt.

220
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,622
Look who's here.

221
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:20,832
- Gretchen.
- Hi.

222
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,085
Always nice to see you.
What a nice surprise.

223
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:26,838
Look at you. You're looking good.

224
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:29,048
Though a bald head
is a bit of a shocker.

225
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:30,758
I know it was for me.

226
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:34,554
Oh, you have a good-shaped head.

227
00:20:34,762 --> 00:20:36,138
- May I?
- Oh, sure.

228
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:39,559
- For good luck, right?
- Exactly. Here's hoping.

229
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,394
- We could use some of that.
- Yeah.

230
00:20:41,602 --> 00:20:45,857
Mrs. Schwartz, thank you so much
for what you've done for my dad.

231
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:51,863
- It was a really good thing.
- You're very welcome.

232
00:20:52,071 --> 00:20:55,199
- We're gonna find a way to repay you.
- No, no, no.

233
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:58,536
We don't wanna ever hear that.

234
00:20:59,912 --> 00:21:02,874
You know, I hate to say it...

235
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:06,210
...but I really need to get going.

236
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,045
Oh, that's too bad.

237
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:10,298
- You can't stay for dinner?
- I wish I could...

238
00:21:10,506 --> 00:21:13,843
...but unfortunately,
I have to try to beat the traffic.

239
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:15,052
Okay. Okay.

240
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:20,057
Well, I hope we get a chance
to catch up real soon.

241
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:21,559
Yeah, hopefully.

242
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:24,604
Gretchen, your purse.

243
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:28,691
Well, good to see you.

244
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,654
And you and Elliott
are welcome anytime. Really.

245
00:21:34,697 --> 00:21:38,159
And I, for one, am gonna be
much better about keeping in touch.

246
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:40,495
- It's so good to see you.
- And you.

247
00:21:40,703 --> 00:21:44,624
- Nice meeting you.
- Likewise.

248
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:48,711
- Okay. Bye, now.
- Drive safely.

249
00:21:50,296 --> 00:21:53,341
You know, what am I thinking?
I should walk her to her car. Really.

250
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:55,384
I'll be right back.

251
00:21:59,263 --> 00:22:00,890
Gretchen.

252
00:22:01,891 --> 00:22:02,892
Hey.

253
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:10,441
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

254
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,485
What did you...?

255
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:16,864
We need to talk.

256
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:21,118
Can you not do or say
anything to anyone until then?

257
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,373
Please. Please.

258
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:44,225
Where's my money, bitch?
I ain't gonna keep asking nice!

259
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:48,563
Yo, all right? I want my money
and my dope. Come on!

260
00:22:48,771 --> 00:22:52,108
- I just wanna say, man--
- What? What do you wanna say?

261
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:53,818
I just wanna go on record, man.

262
00:22:54,026 --> 00:22:57,405
You hit me really, really hard, man.
I think I'm seeing double.

263
00:22:57,613 --> 00:22:59,907
- Maybe I need to go see a hospital.
- Shut up!

264
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:01,909
Jesus.

265
00:23:02,118 --> 00:23:05,454
- Serious, I might have a concussion.
- Don't fall asleep, baby.

266
00:23:05,663 --> 00:23:07,582
- Subdural hematoma.
- Don't fall asleep.

267
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,334
Shut up.

268
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:12,670
All right. Empty your pockets.

269
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:15,256
Turn them out,
everything on the table.

270
00:23:15,464 --> 00:23:16,674
Do it!

271
00:23:21,637 --> 00:23:23,181
All right, turn around.

272
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:24,640
Turn around.

273
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:27,435
Turn out your back pockets.
Come on.

274
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:36,194
All right. Shoes. Give them here.

275
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:51,667
I told you, Diesel,
we ain't holding any--

276
00:23:51,876 --> 00:23:53,544
- We shot it all.
- Yeah?

277
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,048
- Shot an ounce in a day and a half?
- Yeah.

278
00:23:57,256 --> 00:23:59,383
All right, tell you what.

279
00:23:59,592 --> 00:24:03,387
Both of you
pull it out of your butts right now...

280
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:07,558
...or I grab a flashlight and
some pliers and go exploring.

281
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:09,685
What's it gonna be, yo? Come on.

282
00:24:13,105 --> 00:24:14,899
There you go.

283
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:20,112
All right, come on.
On the table.

284
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,325
All right, so, what, you hold the
crystal and she holds the H, huh?

285
00:24:24,534 --> 00:24:25,576
Division of labour.

286
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:30,957
All right,
there's maybe an 8 ball here.

287
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:33,251
Where's the rest of my meth?

288
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:35,878
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.

289
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:37,964
- You shut up.
- You shut up, skank.

290
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:41,008
Shut up! Shut up! Stop it!

291
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:44,887
This really isn't getting any better,
man. It's turning cranial.

292
00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:48,599
Oh, yeah? You see this gun?
It's got five bullets.

293
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:51,978
One for each kneecap,
plus an extra round for your cranial...

294
00:24:52,186 --> 00:24:54,981
...for being such a pussy.

295
00:24:57,483 --> 00:25:00,945
Hey. Hey, baby.

296
00:25:01,154 --> 00:25:05,032
Come here, baby.
Come here, baby.

297
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:11,998
All right.

298
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:15,626
You two are never
getting high again.

299
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:18,421
I will make it my life's mission.

300
00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:21,299
Not another needle,
not another ball...

301
00:25:21,507 --> 00:25:25,553
...not one toke,
not till I get what's mine.

302
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,807
Yeah, we got you covered,
man, sure.

303
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:33,186
It just so happens we got
your money, man, plus interest.

304
00:25:33,394 --> 00:25:34,896
You're damn right, plus interest.

305
00:25:35,104 --> 00:25:37,607
- Where?
- Back yard.

306
00:25:37,815 --> 00:25:40,443
Yo, right hand to the man, dog.
Back yard. Go check it out.

307
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:43,821
- Hurting. Painful.
- Hey, hey, hey.

308
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,742
Me and your old man,
we're just playing a game, all right?

309
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,953
Hey, don't move.

310
00:25:54,248 --> 00:25:56,000
Come on.

311
00:25:58,419 --> 00:25:59,670
See?

312
00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:03,132
Me and the slit just boosted it, yo.
She's like a ant, man.

313
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:06,177
She can lift a hundred times
her own weight. For real.

314
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:08,179
What am I supposed to do with this?

315
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:11,349
Help me break it open.
Take out the money, get paid.

316
00:26:11,557 --> 00:26:13,851
Get high.

317
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:19,732
Yo, that's my bank.

318
00:26:19,941 --> 00:26:22,151
So? It's FIDC insured, yo.

319
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,862
It's a victimless crime.

320
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:26,614
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

321
00:26:28,032 --> 00:26:29,116
<i>Bodega. Way across town.</i>

322
00:26:29,325 --> 00:26:31,828
<i>In, out, like, bam.
Went smooth as silk, yo.</i>

323
00:26:32,411 --> 00:26:35,331
<i>What, nobody saw you?
What about witnesses, dumb-ass?</i>

324
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,708
<i>We roll like the breeze, for real.</i>

325
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,253
<i>All we did,
we just walked in all smooth-like.</i>

326
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:42,713
<i>- Nobody even noticed.
- Nobody noticed?</i>

327
00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:47,593
<i>- For real?
- I'm telling you, victimless crime.</i>

328
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,610
Oh, my God.

329
00:27:01,195 --> 00:27:03,697
Jesus. Come on already.

330
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:07,368
- It's about to give, man. I'm sensing it.
- You don't know what you're doing.

331
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:09,995
I thought you told me
you boosted, like, six of these.

332
00:27:10,204 --> 00:27:12,373
Yeah. Boosted.

333
00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:14,541
It's not like he ever got one open.

334
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,543
At least I got persistence.

335
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:19,630
The law of averages,
lucky number seven.

336
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:24,385
- Don't listen to that skank.
- Stop calling me that.

337
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:26,679
I ain't no skank!

338
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:29,223
- Skank, skank, skank--
- Hey, hey, hey.

339
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:30,933
Sit, sit.

340
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:35,229
All right, I swear to God
I will shoot you both in the face.

341
00:27:36,063 --> 00:27:38,023
Now, chill.

342
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:41,527
You, get that thing open.

343
00:27:41,735 --> 00:27:45,906
You sit the hell down,
and no throwing things.

344
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,371
Where's the kid?

345
00:27:53,956 --> 00:27:55,416
The kid. The little kid!

346
00:27:55,624 --> 00:27:58,585
What are you asking me for?

347
00:28:14,852 --> 00:28:18,439
I got you now, bitch. I got you now.

348
00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:19,898
Didn't see that coming, huh?

349
00:28:24,612 --> 00:28:25,904
What kind of mother are you?

350
00:28:27,323 --> 00:28:30,826
How about you feed the kid a decent
meal every now and then, huh?

351
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:33,579
Give him a bath.
Put some baby powder on him.

352
00:28:33,787 --> 00:28:36,457
Get him some decent TV to watch.
I mean, what is this shit?

353
00:28:36,665 --> 00:28:38,125
Are you serious?

354
00:28:38,334 --> 00:28:41,462
You give me one hit, and I'll be
any kind of mother that you want.

355
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,047
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, Diesel...

356
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,133
...this thing would go easier
if we all had a little taste, man.

357
00:28:48,302 --> 00:28:49,720
Get out of the way.

358
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,556
Get out of the way!

359
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:09,782
So you didn't tell anyone.

360
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,369
- You didn't tell Elliott.
- Not yet.

361
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:17,831
- Well, what does that mean?
- That means exactly what it means.

362
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,335
That's a determination
I have yet to make.

363
00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:27,341
All right, fair enough.
I can appreciate that.

364
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:28,676
All right.

365
00:29:28,884 --> 00:29:34,181
First let me say, I very much
regret involving you in this.

366
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,350
This was...

367
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:40,396
This entire thing was unfortunate.

368
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:42,856
Unfortunate?

369
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:47,403
And I apologise deeply.

370
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:49,530
Thank you.

371
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:54,368
Now please tell me why you did it.

372
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,957
That's not really at issue here.

373
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:04,211
Well, you told me your insurance
was covering it. Was that a lie?

374
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,550
If you won't take our money,
and your insurance isn't covering it...

375
00:30:09,758 --> 00:30:11,218
...how are you paying for it?

376
00:30:11,427 --> 00:30:16,181
This is not an issue
that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?

377
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:19,560
Excuse me, Walt. It does concern me.
It concerns me greatly.

378
00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:22,479
You tell your wife and son...

379
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:24,898
...that I am paying
for your cancer treatment.

380
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:27,735
Why are you doing this?

381
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:32,406
I will clear this up with them.

382
00:30:32,615 --> 00:30:35,826
The look on Skyler's face,
she's sitting there, tears in her eyes...

383
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:37,661
...thanking me for saving your life.

384
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,957
- Why would you do that to her?
- As I said, I will clear this up.

385
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:46,879
Just please allow me to do this
in my own way, in my own time.

386
00:30:47,087 --> 00:30:48,088
All right?

387
00:30:48,297 --> 00:30:50,924
I will explain
the whole thing to them.

388
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:53,594
And while you're at it,
explain it to me.

389
00:30:56,513 --> 00:30:58,849
I don't owe you an explanation.

390
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:02,686
I owe you an apology,
and I have apologised.

391
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:05,689
I am very sorry, Gretchen.

392
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:08,859
There. I've apologised twice now.

393
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:11,946
I'm humbly sorry.

394
00:31:12,154 --> 00:31:13,614
Three times.

395
00:31:13,822 --> 00:31:15,783
Let me just get this straight.

396
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:18,369
Elliott and I offer
to pay for your treatment...

397
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:20,037
...no strings attached.

398
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,456
An offer which still stands,
by the way.

399
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:25,334
And you turn us down out of pride,
whatever...

400
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:29,964
...and then you tell your wife that in
fact we are paying for your treatment.

401
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:32,007
Without our knowledge,
against our will...

402
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:34,218
...you involve us in your lie.

403
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:40,307
And you sit here and tell me
that that is none of my business?

404
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:46,272
Yeah.
That's pretty much the size of it.

405
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:51,151
What happened to you?

406
00:31:54,029 --> 00:31:56,156
Really, Walt.

407
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:58,158
What happened?

408
00:31:58,367 --> 00:32:01,161
Because this isn't you.

409
00:32:04,206 --> 00:32:08,085
What would you know about me,
Gretchen?

410
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:12,715
What would your presumption
about me be, exactly?

411
00:32:12,923 --> 00:32:15,259
That I should go begging
for your charity?

412
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:19,305
And you waving
your chequebook around...

413
00:32:19,513 --> 00:32:23,058
...like some magic wand
is gonna make me forget...

414
00:32:23,267 --> 00:32:24,393
...how you and Elliott--

415
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:27,688
How you and Elliott cut me out?

416
00:32:27,896 --> 00:32:29,690
What? That can't be how you see it.

417
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:33,360
It was my hard work, my research,
and you and Elliott make millions off it.

418
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:35,487
That cannot be how you see it.

419
00:32:35,696 --> 00:32:37,615
- Good. That's beautifully done.
- You left--

420
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,617
You are always
the picture of innocence.

421
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,369
- You left me.
- The picture of innocence.

422
00:32:42,578 --> 00:32:46,123
- Just sweetness and light.
- You left me.

423
00:32:46,915 --> 00:32:48,208
Newport, 4th of July weekend.

424
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:51,545
You and my father and my brothers
and I go up to our room...

425
00:32:51,754 --> 00:32:54,340
...and you're packing your bags,
barely talking.

426
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:57,217
What? Did I dream all of that?

427
00:32:57,426 --> 00:32:59,928
That's your excuse...

428
00:33:00,137 --> 00:33:02,931
...to build your little empire
on my work?

429
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,392
How can you say that to me?
You walked away.

430
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:08,646
You abandoned us, me, Elliott.

431
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:11,565
Little rich girl
just adding to your millions.

432
00:33:15,986 --> 00:33:19,573
I don't even know what to say to you.

433
00:33:20,282 --> 00:33:23,327
I don't even know where to begin.

434
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:33,963
I feel so sorry for you, Walt.

435
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,093
Fuck you.

436
00:34:14,712 --> 00:34:16,630
Hey.

437
00:34:19,675 --> 00:34:23,220
Hey, little man, you hungry?

438
00:34:37,026 --> 00:34:38,569
Hey.

439
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:04,261
Man. No, no, what are you doing?

440
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:07,139
No, what are you doing?

441
00:35:09,558 --> 00:35:11,560
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

442
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:13,437
Baby, get up and help me.

443
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:17,191
Call me a bad mother.
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

444
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:19,318
Get up, damn it! Get our dope!

445
00:35:23,197 --> 00:35:24,281
Bedtime.

446
00:35:28,035 --> 00:35:30,579
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

447
00:35:35,376 --> 00:35:38,212
Who's the big tough guy now, huh?
Is that you?

448
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,297
Is that you? You're the big man?

449
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:43,175
Try and hit me now, bitch.
Try and hit me now!

450
00:35:43,384 --> 00:35:46,011
Try and hit me now, bitch.

451
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:19,044
Oh, hey.

452
00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:21,672
Should I ask where you've been?

453
00:36:22,798 --> 00:36:24,508
Never mind.

454
00:36:24,717 --> 00:36:27,720
We're long past that, I suppose.

455
00:36:28,804 --> 00:36:30,639
Skyler.

456
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,190
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

457
00:36:50,618 --> 00:36:52,286
Walt.

458
00:36:53,162 --> 00:36:55,456
We need to talk.

459
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:09,094
Just say it.

460
00:37:18,896 --> 00:37:21,774
They're cutting off the money.

461
00:37:33,535 --> 00:37:36,497
What did she say, exactly?

462
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:43,837
Not much. It was abrupt.

463
00:37:44,046 --> 00:37:47,883
She said something like:

464
00:37:49,385 --> 00:37:53,305
"I'm sorry to have to do this...

465
00:37:53,514 --> 00:37:58,102
...but Elliott and I can no longer
continue to pay for Walt's treatment.

466
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,397
I wish you the very best."

467
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:05,442
And that was it.

468
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:12,700
Yeah.

469
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:17,621
I mean, she sounded apologetic.
I guess.

470
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,748
It was quick.
She got right off the phone.

471
00:38:19,957 --> 00:38:22,459
I was so stunned, but...

472
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:27,589
I called her back
and she didn't pick up.

473
00:38:33,554 --> 00:38:38,809
So, what do you know about this?

474
00:38:41,478 --> 00:38:46,567
I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice
visit this afternoon...

475
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:50,404
...and then you come home
and she's in a big hurry to leave...

476
00:38:50,613 --> 00:38:53,907
...and then the two of you
are talking in the driveway.

477
00:38:57,953 --> 00:38:59,705
Walt.

478
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:02,416
What do you know that I don't?

479
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:09,757
Where were you tonight?

480
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:13,218
I drove up to Santa Fe.

481
00:39:15,888 --> 00:39:17,139
I was with Gretchen.

482
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:20,601
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

483
00:39:21,685 --> 00:39:26,357
She just couldn't bring
herself to tell you today.

484
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:29,443
I mean, she couldn't tell me,
either, really.

485
00:39:29,652 --> 00:39:32,780
I mean, there was
a lot of hemming and hawing...

486
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:34,865
...and beating around the bush--

487
00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:38,953
Okay, what--? Tell us what?

488
00:39:40,704 --> 00:39:42,456
Well...

489
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,459
There was a lot of...

490
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:49,129
...business phraseology
being tossed around.

491
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:54,885
You know, things like "cash-poor"
and "leveraged"...

492
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:57,054
..."quarterly decline,"
yadda, yadda, yadda.

493
00:39:57,262 --> 00:40:01,600
But what they were truly saying,
in my opinion...

494
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:07,064
They're broke.

495
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:10,651
- You are kidding me.
- No.

496
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,238
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
We all know that.

497
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:19,076
And all these big banks
and Fannie Mae and...

498
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:21,954
Well, apparently, Gray Matter...

499
00:40:22,162 --> 00:40:26,000
...is no more immune
than anyone else.

500
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:29,044
That is--

501
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:32,923
Jesus, that's...

502
00:40:36,385 --> 00:40:37,678
Yeah.

503
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:54,028
You know, she could have
just told me herself.

504
00:40:56,614 --> 00:40:59,199
Well, they're prideful people.

505
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:03,454
Listen.

506
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:07,166
Not to sound selfish...

507
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,377
...but as far as we go...

508
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:14,048
...we'll get through this, okay?

509
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:21,013
I mean, they've already paid
for most of my treatment, right?

510
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,723
Hey.

511
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:31,523
We're gonna make it. All right?
I promise.

512
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:33,692
Okay.

513
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,288
And yet...

514
00:41:47,623 --> 00:41:50,626
...she still drives a Bentley.

515
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:59,927
Keeping up appearances.
Who knows?

516
00:42:12,314 --> 00:42:15,276
Baby, that don't make any sense.

517
00:42:15,484 --> 00:42:19,196
Of course it makes sense.
Every safe's got its weak spot, right?

518
00:42:19,405 --> 00:42:22,199
You're designing a safe, where
you gonna put your weak spot?

519
00:42:22,408 --> 00:42:23,867
Nowhere.

520
00:42:24,076 --> 00:42:26,996
I'd make it, like, strong.

521
00:42:27,204 --> 00:42:29,290
Jesus. On the bottom, that's where.

522
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:31,625
You put your weak spot
on the bottom.

523
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:36,547
Oh, baby,
that H is bringing me down.

524
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:39,049
Yeah, you took too much. I told you.

525
00:42:39,258 --> 00:42:42,261
I need to... I need to even out.

526
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:45,681
- Let me get a hit of that crystal.
- Hell, no. You lost your share.

527
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:47,182
Come on, baby.

528
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:50,394
It's all I need, just a little hit.

529
00:42:50,603 --> 00:42:54,523
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
I'm trying to concentrate.

530
00:42:54,732 --> 00:42:56,567
I ain't no skank.

531
00:42:57,401 --> 00:43:01,155
I would appreciate an apology.

532
00:43:04,867 --> 00:43:05,909
What?

533
00:43:06,118 --> 00:43:08,829
I am trying to take
the high road here.

534
00:43:09,038 --> 00:43:10,372
Are you gonna do right?

535
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:11,665
Listen to me, stupid.

536
00:43:11,874 --> 00:43:15,377
I am in the middle
of some very important work.

537
00:43:15,586 --> 00:43:19,340
I am on the verge here, all right?
So shut your skank ass pie hole...

538
00:43:19,548 --> 00:43:23,052
...and assist me and shut up.

539
00:43:26,472 --> 00:43:28,682
I ain't no skank.

540
00:43:28,891 --> 00:43:30,851
Skank, skank, skank ass skank.

541
00:43:31,435 --> 00:43:34,521
Skank ass skank. Skank ass skank.

542
00:43:35,189 --> 00:43:36,523
You listening to me, skank?

543
00:43:37,107 --> 00:43:38,400
You hear me, skank?

544
00:43:38,609 --> 00:43:42,696
You are a skank ass skank. Skank.

545
00:43:42,905 --> 00:43:46,784
Skank, skank, skank. Skank.

546
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:50,162
I ain't no skank.

547
00:43:50,537 --> 00:43:52,957
No, no, no. Don't. No.

548
00:44:09,223 --> 00:44:12,059
I ain't no skank.

549
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:13,120
<i>911.</i>

550
00:45:26,258 --> 00:45:28,886
Hey, hey.
Hey, you remember peekaboo?

551
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:32,306
Can you go peekaboo like this?
Can you keep your eyes closed?

552
00:45:32,514 --> 00:45:35,225
You keep them closed. That's good.
That's good. That's good.

553
00:45:35,434 --> 00:45:37,645
All right.
You keep them closed just like that.

554
00:45:37,853 --> 00:45:41,315
It's a little game
we're gonna play, okay?

555
00:45:53,744 --> 00:45:55,663
Here you go.

556
00:45:55,871 --> 00:46:00,501
Hey. Hey, look at me.
You wait right here. Okay?

557
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:04,338
It's just part of the game.
You wait right here, and...

558
00:46:05,547 --> 00:46:09,343
Look, just...
Just don't go back inside. All right?

559
00:46:09,551 --> 00:46:12,471
You stay right here. Okay?

560
00:46:19,353 --> 00:46:22,982
You have a good
rest of your life, kid.
