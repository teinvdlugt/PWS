1
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,355
Are you okay?

2
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,241
- You are a lifesaver.
- Yeah, man.

3
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,785
Yeah, we can't
thank you enough.

4
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,203
No, hey, mad...
Mad props.

5
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,163
I could have sworn
the guy said south.

6
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,874
But then all of a sudden
we're off the main road

7
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,876
then I'm trying to read the map
while I'm driving,

8
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,252
which is a bonehead maneuver.

9
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,339
And then all of a sudden, bam,
we're... We're in that ditch.

10
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,966
Yeah, bam. I'm like, "What
the hell?" You know?

11
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,929
Yes. Oh, yes, and my coffee mug.
Of coffee? My mug of coffee.

12
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,808
It spills all over my pants,
I mean... Just a nightmare.

13
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,768
There's your Sony GPS,
I mean, for real.

14
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,827
Let's just...

15
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,505
Like I said,
we couldn't be more grateful.

16
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,397
Can't we just
dump them here?

17
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,274
What,
and somebody finds them?

18
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,650
Then what?

19
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,694
People have seen us.

20
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,869
Hey, you're... You're
gonna flood it, man.

21
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,454
I'm not gonna flood it. She's
not going to flood, all right?

22
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,124
We're just gonna stay positive,
right?

23
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:31,711
We're gonna clean up
this mess. And you, start.

24
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,380
Goddamn it. See, you flooded it.

25
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,965
All right.

26
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,594
All right. You know what?
The RV is going to start now.

27
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,512
The RV is going to start
right now.

28
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,390
It's gonna start and we're gonna
drive it over to your house.

29
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,725
My house?
Yes. Your house.

30
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,811
We're gonna drive it over there and
park it overnight. And then tomorrow...

31
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,646
Uh-uh, man, not my house.

32
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,025
Shut up! Shut up!

33
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,957
After we finish
cleaning up this mess,

34
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,959
we will go our separate ways.

35
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,004
Our paths will never cross.

36
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,465
And we will tell this to no one.

37
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,175
Understood?

38
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,846
Oh, what, I can talk now?

39
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:29,352
Fine. That goes double for me.

40
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,191
Okay. Okay.

41
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,109
Be good to me.

42
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,033
Yes!

43
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,332
Yes. Okay. Okay.

44
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,875
Thank you.

45
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,480
Oh, shit.

46
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,717
Walt?

47
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,346
You coming out?

48
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,518
Mm-hm.

49
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,774
Yeah, absolutely.

50
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,527
We got looky-loos
in both directions, Dan.

51
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,113
Better plan on being late if
you're going in that direction.

52
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,865
This is Lisa in the Skycopter,

53
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,118
we'll have more Albuquerque
traffic on the hour.

54
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,289
Hey, um, you wanna hear
something funny?

55
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,960
We had a... A faculty
meeting last Thursday

56
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:21,047
and the topic was
senior-class photos

57
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,592
and how we had instituted
a new rule last year

58
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,636
that seniors are allowed
to have photos taken

59
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,056
by a photographer
of their choice.

60
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,641
You know, not necessarily
the photographer

61
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,934
that the school hires, right?
So...

62
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:36,937
- Um, eh,

63
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,524
so anyway, uh,
some of the senior girls

64
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,487
were going to that, um,
Glamour Shots place

65
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,696
to have their photos taken.

66
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,325
And now they're bringing us
all these photos,

67
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,410
and Joan Everman...
You know Joan.

68
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,662
- Suddenly has to go through
all these photos

69
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,750
and turn them down
because they show cleavage.

70
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,838
Did you get enough
pancakes, sweetie?

71
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,674
Yeah. L... I'm good.

72
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,051
Okay.

73
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,178
You know, even
the small-busted girls

74
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,346
have cleavage.

75
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,766
Apparently there's some new type

76
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,310
of brassiere or something.

77
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,939
The Wonderbra.

78
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,068
It's the Wonderbra.
Yeah?

79
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,570
Okay.

80
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,701
Hey, there.
You've reached Walt,

81
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,537
Skyler and Walter Jr.

82
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,039
We can't come to the phone right
now, so please leave us a message.

83
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,834
Hello, Mr. White.

84
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,669
This is AT&T calling.

85
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,922
Are you happy with your current
long-distance service?

86
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,217
Because if you're not, I would
definitely really, really love

87
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,427
to talk to you
as soon as possible about...

88
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,638
Hello? Hello? Hello, this
is Walter White speaking.

89
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,890
You said he was
practically dead, okay?

90
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,684
You said he would die
any minute.

91
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,061
Listen, uh,
I am having breakfast

92
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,437
with my family right now

93
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,315
and I... I really don't
appreciate these sales calls.

94
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,901
Well, too bad, man,
because guess what.

95
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,820
He's still not dead.

96
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,531
I went and put my ear to the RV.
I can hear him, like,

97
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,408
rolling around in there,
all right?

98
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,034
I... I... I think he's awake, man.

99
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,828
I think he's trying
to get loose.

100
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,913
Where the hell are you?
I'm freaking out over here.

101
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,415
Calm down, damn it.

102
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,083
Are you gonna help me
clean this up?

103
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,918
Huh? We got loose ends here.

104
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,420
Calm down.

105
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,213
I will be there after school.

106
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,424
Huh, after school.
Are you shitting me?

107
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,593
Ditch it, man. Call in sick.

108
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,470
Listen, uh, that
is just not gonna work for me.

109
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,347
I'm... I'm not interested
in that at all.

110
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,851
And, uh, I would appreciate it
if you don't call here anymore.

111
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,854
Damn. They're so
annoying, those people.

112
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,943
You have a good day, sweetie.

113
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,278
Okay, Mom. You too.

114
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,655
Okay.
Bye, honey.

115
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,120
Drive safe.
Okay.

116
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,800
Yo, yo, yo,

117
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,595
1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3
to the 6 to the 9,

118
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,222
representing the ABQ.

119
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,724
What up, beyotch?
Leave it at the tone.

120
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,869
So the term "chiral"

121
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,414
derives from the Greek word
"hand."

122
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,084
Now, the concept here
being that

123
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,754
just as your left hand
and your right hand

124
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,507
are mirror images
of one another, right,

125
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,175
identical and yet opposite,

126
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,262
well, so, too,
organic compounds can exist

127
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,224
as mirror-image forms
of one another

128
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,434
all the way down
at the molecular level.

129
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,188
But although they may
look the same,

130
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,775
they don't always
behave the same.

131
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:16,657
For instance...

132
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,869
Uh, I'm sorry.
Uh, for instance, uh...

133
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,621
Thalidomide.

134
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:27,543
The... The right-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide

135
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,670
is a perfectly fine,
good medicine

136
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,756
to give to a pregnant woman
to prevent morning sickness.

137
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,677
But make the mistake of giving
that same pregnant woman

138
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:41,223
the left-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide

139
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:46,103
and her child will be born
with horrible birth defects.

140
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,608
Which is precisely
what happened in the 1950s.

141
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:55,279
So chiral, chirality,

142
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,990
mirrored images, right?

143
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,744
Active, inactive, good, bad.

144
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,374
Uh, so.

145
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,584
Yes, Ben.

146
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,544
Is this gonna be
on the murder?

147
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,381
What?

148
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,134
Is this gonna be
on the midterm?

149
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,888
Uh, chirality on the midterm?

150
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,725
No, no. Well, maybe.
Maybe. Yes, you know...

151
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,561
But prepare for it
to be on the midterm.

152
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,980
Can't hurt to know it, right?
So...

153
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,149
Knowledge is power.

154
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,811
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. No.

155
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,195
Not good.
Not good, not good.

156
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,423
What the...?

157
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,614
Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

158
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,574
Hey, listen, you.

159
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,867
No, no, no, no!

160
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,165
Oh, God.

161
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,295
Okay.

162
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,606
MILFs?

163
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,650
The hell is a MILF?

164
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,338
Now what?

165
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,927
Lock the other one
out in the RV.

166
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,846
He's, uh:

167
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,514
You're sure?
Yes.

168
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:33,890
You're positive?
Hey, you know what?

169
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,183
Feel free to go
check it yourself.

170
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,019
Hey, yeah, Good idea.
Maybe I should do that

171
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,146
before he, too, wanders off
down the damn street.

172
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,522
Okay, you know what?
I am sick...

173
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,773
Just... All right.
All right!

174
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,358
Just...

175
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,695
The one downstairs,
tell me about him.

176
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,196
Oh, come on. Anything.
Something.

177
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,032
Start with his name,
at least.

178
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,533
Krazy-8.

179
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,244
Krazy-8. What the hell
does that even mean?

180
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,871
I don't know, man, okay?

181
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,041
It means, like... Like,
Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

182
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,210
So you work with him regularly.

183
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,379
No, not him so much.

184
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,215
His cousin, mainly.
Who's his cousin?

185
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,967
The... The guy out in the RV.

186
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,385
All right, all right,
all right.

187
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,055
Krazy-8's one level higher.

188
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,723
One level higher.

189
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:18,560
Yeah, you know.
Not, like, street level. Higher.

190
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,563
You know how there's, like,
a Starbucks on every corner?

191
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,400
Krazy-8 is like the dude
that sells Starbucks' beans.

192
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,361
Okay, so he's a distributor.

193
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,824
Okay, so is he?
I mean, is?

194
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:38,080
In other words, what is his
reputation for violence?

195
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,916
Well, um, he did try

196
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,085
to kill us both yesterday,
so there's that.

197
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,628
Look, what I'm trying to say

198
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,546
is that he's a distributor,
right?

199
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,092
He's a... He's a businessman.
He's a man of business.

200
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,094
It would therefore
seem to follow that he is

201
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:56,556
capable of acting out of
mutual self-interest, yes?

202
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,266
What?

203
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:03,271
Do you think he is capable
of listening to reason?

204
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,149
I mean, what...? What kind
of reason? You mean, like,

205
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,151
"Dear Krazy-8, hey, listen,
if I let you go,

206
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,779
you promise not to come back
and waste my entire family?

207
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,448
No Colombian neckties?"
You mean that kind of reason?

208
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,575
No, man, I can't say as I have
high fucking hopes

209
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,785
where that's concerned.

210
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,919
What was that?

211
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,629
What was what?
Shh!

212
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,593
Come!
What?

213
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,513
We didn't tie him up.

214
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:37,973
Why the hell
didn't we tie him up?

215
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,558
Oh, God.

216
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,143
Because he was out cold.

217
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,437
Yeah, but what...
What if he's faking it?

218
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,730
You know, like,
if it was me,

219
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,983
I'd be all faking
being knocked out, yo.

220
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,152
And then,
when the coast is clear,

221
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,571
I'd be up looking
for weapons and shit.

222
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:53,905
Ready to pounce.

223
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,962
Shh, shh, shh.

224
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,348
No, see. Now, if it was me

225
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,225
and I couldn't find
a decent enough weapon,

226
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:26,271
I would just lie back down
and bide my time.

227
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,536
So now what do we do?

228
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,417
You keep asking me that

229
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,879
like you think I have
some answer.

230
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,590
Well, you gotta
do something.

231
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:36,883
No, we.

232
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,970
We have got to do something,
and I am open to suggestions.

233
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,639
Man, uh, okay,
this whole thing was your deal.

234
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,933
Don't you dare put that on me.

235
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,601
You brought those guys
out there.

236
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,103
This is your responsibility.

237
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,689
Oh, like I came to you,
begging to cook meth.

238
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,774
"Oh, hey, nerdiest old dude
I know,

239
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,277
you wanna come cook crystal?"
Please.

240
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,112
I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny

241
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,531
but her wheelchair
wouldn't fit in the RV.

242
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,374
What about the, uh...
The... The... The phosphate gas?

243
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,751
The phosphine gas.
What about it?

244
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,880
Well, do... I mean, do you think
it still might kill him?

245
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,757
You know, with, like,
a delayed reaction or something?

246
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,344
I... I don't know.

247
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,971
You're supposed
to be a scientist.

248
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,640
Look, this isn't even
the issue

249
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,476
that demands
immediate attention.

250
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,854
We have got a body in that RV.

251
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,314
And it's getting warmer outside.

252
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,648
Understand?

253
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:37,068
And we have got to
do something about that soon.

254
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,529
And in a way that
no one will ever find it.

255
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:44,492
Now, that... That last part
is very, very important.

256
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,831
Therefore, it seems to me

257
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,875
that our best course of action

258
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:55,837
would be chemical
disincorporation.

259
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,843
Dissolving in strong acid.

260
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,644
Oh, man, that's messed up.

261
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,606
I mean, ahem,
you're not serious.

262
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,527
You serious?

263
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,328
Well, who's gonna do that?

264
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,538
And don't look at me.

265
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,834
I guess we'll both do it
together.

266
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,088
No, Mr. White, okay, I'm not...
I'm not good with dead bodies.

267
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:43,051
Look, we are in this
fifty-fifty. Okay?

268
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:51,643
I guess the only other fair way
to go about this would be

269
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:56,856
that one of us deals with
the body situation

270
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:02,404
while the other one of us deals
with the Krazy-8 situation.

271
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:13,915
In a scenario like this,
I don't suppose it is bad form

272
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:18,712
to just flip a coin.

273
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,095
Heads or tails?

274
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,931
No, I'll... I'll do the body
in the acid, okay?

275
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,225
Heads or tails?

276
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,445
Heads. Heads.

277
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:03,465
Best two out of three?

278
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,943
Yo, yo, yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3

279
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,821
to the 6 to the 9,
representing the ABQ.

280
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,324
What up, beyotch?
Leave it at the tone.

281
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,329
Hey, Mr. White, it's me.
Pick up.

282
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,664
I got a container question.

283
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:41,252
Hello, Mr. White.
Pick up the phone, man.

284
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,755
Yes.
Yo, what kind of plastic, man?

285
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,132
Polyethylene.

286
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,344
Well, how the hell am I
supposed to know that?

287
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,179
Because I told you.

288
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,472
Look, just...

289
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,977
Look at the bottom
for a triangle

290
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,396
stamped LDPE.

291
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,607
It should be molded
right into the plastic.

292
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, LDPE.
Right on, got it.

293
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:09,864
I don't know, man.
This feels kind of flimsy.

294
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,367
Any decent acid's
gonna eat right through this.

295
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:15,203
Not hydrofluoric.
Why not?

296
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,709
Look, you skipped,
clowned around

297
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,630
or otherwise jerked off through
every lecture I ever gave.

298
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,008
As far as I'm concerned,
your chemistry education is over.

299
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,761
Oh, okay, be a dick about it.
Jesus.

300
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,517
So, hey, have you, um?

301
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,519
Have you done the...?
The thing?

302
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,733
Yeah, I'm...

303
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,735
I'm working up to it.

304
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,240
You know what?

305
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,367
I bet he doesn't even wake up.

306
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,329
You know, not even if you took
him to the hospital right now.

307
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:00,957
Now, if it was me,

308
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,586
I would just try and think of it
like I was...

309
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,379
I was doing him a favor.

310
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,365
I need a check
approval on checkstand eight.

311
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,827
Approval on checkstand eight,
please. Thank you.

312
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,636
Yeah.

313
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,346
Who's there?

314
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,311
What, you fucking break in?
Show me who's there.

315
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,735
Yeah. I see you.

316
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,197
What you gonna do?

317
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,784
Hey.

318
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,994
Hey...!

319
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:49,584
Hey!

320
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:51,919
I need water.

321
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:57,008
Hey, hello.

322
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,093
Bring me some water,
would you?

323
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,181
Please.

324
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,007
You don't like the crust?

325
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,020
Where's my cousin Emilio?

326
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,110
He dead?

327
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,554
Oh, I'm a coward.

328
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,726
Hey, Mr. White.

329
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,437
Hey, Mr. White?

330
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,565
Oh, fuck.

331
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:48,114
Are you smoking weed?
Oh, my God.

332
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:51,117
Wait a minute, is that...?
Is that my weed?

333
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,537
What the hell, man?

334
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,747
Make yourself at home,
why don't you?

335
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,503
So, what'd you end up buying?

336
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,255
Nothing.

337
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:09,802
No store in town sells a plastic
bin big enough for a body.

338
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:14,640
I don't suppose
you could buy two bins?

339
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,351
And, uh, just:

340
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,522
Legs in one,
torso in the other?

341
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,733
Oh, God.

342
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,695
I don't suppose
you could kiss my ass?

343
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,705
So, uh,

344
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,542
how'd it...? How'd it go?

345
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,384
You didn't do it?

346
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,178
Not... Not yet.

347
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:55,348
Oh, God.

348
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,894
Oh, damn. I gotta go.
Hey, hey.

349
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,480
What? No, no, no.
Come back here.

350
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,691
Sorry. I'll do it tomorrow,
I promise.

351
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:06,901
Tomorrow?

352
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:09,236
I've got a doctor's appointment.
I gotta go.

353
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,865
Look, stay away from him.
He's awake.

354
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,244
Hey, man, we flipped a coin.

355
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,708
We flipped a coin!

356
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,174
We're... We're good?

357
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,928
We're very good.
We're excellent, I'd say.

358
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,806
Oh.

359
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,434
Oh, would you look
at that face?

360
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,437
Smile, peanut.

361
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,859
So who's up for knowing?

362
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,362
Oh...
Uh...

363
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,615
It's... It's...
Uh...

364
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,493
Yeah.

365
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:58,786
Girl.

366
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,538
Girl?

367
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,623
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

368
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:05,543
Wow.

369
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,756
Oh, God. Can I tell you,
that's exactly what I was hoping.

370
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,591
Yeah?
Yeah.

371
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,720
You remember you said that
when she's 16 and starts dating.

372
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,764
Looking fabulous.

373
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,808
Let me see if they're done
with the blood sugar,

374
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:24,437
then we'll get you out of here.
I'll be right back.

375
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,424
Who's Jesse Pinkman?

376
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,348
Jesse?

377
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,351
Jesse Pinkman.

378
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,564
He... He called
just this morning.

379
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:09,774
Walt, please don't deny it.

380
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,233
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

381
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:15,362
It... It says on his MyShout page
he attended Wynne.

382
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,198
What, was he one
of your students?

383
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,407
Yeah.

384
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:21,285
He was nobody.

385
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,707
Who...? Who is he to you?
Why...? Why is he calling?

386
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,083
What is this big secret

387
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:32,046
you seem to be discussing
with some druggie burnout?

388
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:39,345
You don't come home last night
until 2 in the morning.

389
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:40,888
You don't tell me
where you've been.

390
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:45,017
You spent the entire night
in the bathroom, Walt.

391
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,562
Tell me what's going on
with you.

392
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,190
Don't you think
you owe me that?

393
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:57,822
Who is this Jesse Pinkman
to you?

394
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,578
He sells me pot.

395
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,875
He sells you pot?

396
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,919
Marijuana, yeah.

397
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:16,173
Not a lot.
I mean, I don't know.

398
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,344
I kind of like it.

399
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,472
Are you out of your mind?

400
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,432
What...? What are you, like,
16 years old?

401
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,102
Your brother-in-law
is a DEA agent.

402
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,771
What...?
What is wrong with you?

403
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,983
Look, Skyler,

404
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:42,908
I just haven't
quite been myself lately.

405
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,661
Yeah. No shit.
Thanks for noticing.

406
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,080
I haven't been myself lately,

407
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,207
but I love you.

408
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,794
Nothing about that
has changed.

409
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,171
Nothing ever will.

410
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,508
So right now, what I need

411
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:03,846
is for you to climb down
out of my ass.

412
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,059
Can you do that?

413
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,020
Will you do that for me, honey?

414
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,857
Will you please, just once,

415
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,525
get off my ass?

416
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,569
You know.

417
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:23,240
I'd appreciate it.
I really would.

418
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,721
Stop.

419
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,485
Stop in... In 15 minutes.

420
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,555
Your face is too sharp.

421
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,188
Powder. Powder!

422
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,065
Take a powder, go on.

423
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:44,321
Nice. Beautiful talcum powder.

424
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,657
Lucky you, number eight.

425
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,663
Just meat, it's all just...
Just a bunch of meat.

426
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:01,130
Oh, Jesus.

427
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,344
You're cool,
you're cool.

428
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:11,890
You're all good, you're all...
You're all good. You know it.

429
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,143
It's fine.
It's just a bunch of meat.

430
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,478
Come on. You're good.

431
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,753
Excuse me.

432
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,965
Excuse me. You. Yes, you.

433
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,092
May I talk to you?

434
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,388
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, hey, hey.

435
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:52,639
This is private property.

436
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,475
Just a minute.
I... I wanna talk to you.

437
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,144
- No, no, not interested. Come on.
- Hey, don't touch me.

438
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,897
Do not touch me.

439
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,483
All right, all right, look, not touching, okay?
Not touching here.

440
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,319
Look, lady, whatever you're
selling, I ain't buying, yo.

441
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:08,238
Well, my name
is Skyler White, yo.

442
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,532
My husband
is Walter White, yo.

443
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,285
Uh-huh.

444
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:14,995
He told me everything.

445
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,747
Seriously?

446
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,290
That's right.

447
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,210
And just so you know,

448
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,838
my brother-in-law
is a DEA agent

449
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,341
and I will not hesitate
to call him.

450
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,928
Not if I have to.
Understood?

451
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,099
This is your one
and only warning.

452
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,478
Do not sell marijuana
to my husband.

453
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,315
Okay.
I mean it.

454
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,526
Don't call our house again.

455
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:49,404
You stay away from him, or
you will be one sorry individual.

456
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:52,366
You get me?

457
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,285
L... I, uh, think so, yeah.

458
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,871
Um, no more marijuana.
Mm-hm.

459
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,665
I can... I can dig it.

460
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:03,335
You can dig it. Wonderful.

461
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,055
Not that it's any
of my business,

462
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:19,226
but you might wanna consider
a different line of work.

463
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,436
Okay.

464
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,242
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

465
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,119
Let's go to your house,
you know.

466
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,996
Makes perfect sense.

467
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,206
Let's, uh...

468
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,501
Let's completely screw up
your house

469
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,795
so you never wanna spend
another night in it.

470
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,423
Sure. You know, why not?

471
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,806
Yeah, and how's about I send
over my psycho-bitch wife

472
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,643
to, uh, you know, break your
balls and threaten you?

473
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,895
God, that would be hilarious,
you know.

474
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,397
And then, you know,
the killer in the basement,

475
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,692
the one who's completely
my responsibility,

476
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,154
hell, let's just
let him live down there.

477
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,616
Just, I don't know, make sure
to feed him, like,

478
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,952
three times a day.

479
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,414
Sure, why not?
It's been really amazing.

480
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,083
Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

481
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:10,003
I always dreamt about,
I don't know, melting bodies.

482
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,738
You got a brother
in the goddamn DEA?

483
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,451
What?

484
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,370
You said you were just doing
some ride-along.

485
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:46,498
Yes or no, do you have a brother
in the DEA?

486
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:48,834
He's a brother-in-law.

487
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,837
Oh, well, there's a load
off my mind.

488
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:53,213
Where did you hear that?

489
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,048
Your freaking wife told me

490
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,301
when she was here
all up in my shit.

491
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,844
Yeah, that's right.

492
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,388
She almost caught me
moving Emilio.

493
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:04,683
Good job on wearing
the pants in the family.

494
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,894
And why'd you go and tell her
I was selling you weed?

495
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:11,982
Because somehow
it seemed preferable

496
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,069
to admitting that I cook
crystal meth and killed a man.

497
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,580
Is that what I think it is?

498
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:28,123
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
I smoked a bowl.

499
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,500
So what?
My house, my rules.

500
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,919
Hey, no, no.
Hey, don't give me that, okay?

501
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,504
I held up my end.

502
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,131
I already took care
of Emilio.

503
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,508
You're still diddling around
trying to get your nut up.

504
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,427
Yeah, well, boo-hoo.

505
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,387
I have the truly awful job here.

506
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,806
Oh, you wanna... You wanna talk
awful? You wanna go there?

507
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:49,144
Try dragging 200 pounds of stink
up a flight of stairs.

508
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:51,521
I barely got him in the bathtub.

509
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:55,233
Bathtub, what?
What do you mean, bathtub?

510
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,443
You know,
and that's another thing.

511
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,986
Why you got me
running around town

512
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,489
trying to find
some stupid piece of plastic

513
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,949
when I have a perfectly good tub
I can use?

514
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,164
Oh, God.

515
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,708
Hey. Hey.

516
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:10,058
I'm sorry, what were you
asking me? Oh, yes.

517
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:14,521
That stupid plastic container
I asked you to buy.

518
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:18,316
You see, hydrofluoric acid
won't eat through plastic.

519
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:24,823
It will, however, dissolve
metal, rock, glass, ceramic.

520
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,117
So there's that.

521
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,068
Here I go.
