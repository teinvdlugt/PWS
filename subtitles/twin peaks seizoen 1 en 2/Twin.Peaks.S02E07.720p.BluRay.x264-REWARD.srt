1
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,557
Everything's set. They're waiting for us
at the Great Northern.

2
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:47,314
Yeah, a large house made of wood,
surrounded by trees.

3
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:52,027
The house is filled with many rooms
each alike,

4
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:58,492
but occupied by different souls
night after night.

5
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:04,206
- The guests will be in the lobby?
- Full cooperation.

6
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:08,085
Hawk, you got that warrant
for Harold Smith's apartment?

7
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,088
On my way
as soon as I finish my coffee.

8
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,049
Hawk,
Gordon has mentioned pages...

9
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,302
What I mentioned were pages
found near the bloody towel

10
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,555
down the train tracks
from the crime site

11
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,057
were from a diary.

12
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,226
Donna Hayward
spoke of Harold Smith

13
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,979
having a secret diary
of Laura Palmer's.

14
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:30,732
Could be important.
Let me know what you dig up.

15
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,193
Gordon, I understand you're...?

16
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,612
Gordon, I understand
you're on your way to Bend, Oregon?

17
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,409
I'm over to Bend, Oregon,
official business, real hush-hush.

18
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,870
Good luck to all of you.

19
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,376
- Coop.
- Gordon.

20
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,255
Take good care of Mike.

21
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,467
It was real nice meeting you fellas.

22
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,761
- Sheriff.
- Safe journey, chief.

23
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,471
Thanks.

24
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,864
No.

25
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:29,124
No.

26
00:03:47,393 --> 00:04:09,373
No.

27
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,463
Sheriff? Sheriff!

28
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:21,426
Sheriff, what's the meaning of this?
What the hell is going on here?

29
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,685
Will somebody please tell me
what the hell is happening here?

30
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,232
What in the hell is going on?

31
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,841
Mr. Smith.

32
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,219
Harold Smith?

33
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,343
Morning.

34
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,681
- Good morning, dear.
- Good morning, Maddy.

35
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,672
Uncle Leland.

36
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,425
Aunt Sarah.

37
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:31,556
Sit. Oh, good, you got some coffee.
Good.

38
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:36,728
- Did you sleep well?
- Very well. Thanks.

39
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,317
I've been thinking.

40
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,654
I've really enjoyed my stay
and everything.

41
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,239
Aw.

42
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:53,370
But I really feel like it's time
for me to go home now.

43
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,750
To Missoula.

44
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,130
I've got my job and my apartment.

45
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,340
And I just...

46
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,262
...miss having a life of my own.
Uh-huh.

47
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:17,644
So I think I'll probably be driving
back home tomorrow.

48
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,854
Tomorrow?

49
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:23,942
Well, we are going to miss you
very much.

50
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,029
- But we also understand completely.
- You do?

51
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,074
- We do.
- We do. Yes, we do.

52
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,956
You have been
such a wonderful help.

53
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,710
Yes, but now she has to think
about herself, honey.

54
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,004
She's got her own life.

55
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,840
Besides, you'll come back and visit,
won't you?

56
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,009
Oh, of course.

57
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,512
- I'll come galloping back often.
- Heh, heh, heh.

58
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,557
It's not like Missoula
was at the far end of the universe.

59
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,184
- No.
- Hardly.

60
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,436
Well, good then.

61
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,563
It's all right.

62
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,819
Just know that we love you
very much.

63
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,615
I love you too.

64
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,388
- Hey, what's that, a note?
- Yeah.

65
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,068
"I'm a lonely soul."

66
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,487
Poor guy.

67
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,782
It's a good thing
Andy didn't see this one.

68
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,991
Oh, yeah.

69
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,540
Take a look at this.

70
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,926
"This is the diary of Laura Palmer."

71
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,971
Pay dirt.

72
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:42,581
Well, we have bills here
that total $1,014.

73
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,584
Including the insurance money

74
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,711
that leaves you with...

75
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,299
Forty-two dollars.

76
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,053
- Forty-two dollars.
- That's a good start.

77
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,515
Forty-two dollars for the month?

78
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,851
How am I gonna make it?

79
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,854
How are we supposed to survive
on $42 a month?

80
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,733
We? Shelly, I can't keep telling
my mom and dad

81
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,860
that I'm spending the night
at Mike's.

82
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,154
What time is it?
I'm missing Economics as it is.

83
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,449
"We" meant me and Leo.

84
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,577
Bobby, you said
you were gonna take care of us.

85
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,913
I am, Shelly. I am.

86
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,251
I want you
to take the necklace back.

87
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,465
We don't have to do that.

88
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,595
I want you to take the necklace back.
We need the money.

89
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,806
Shelly, you're gonna
keep this necklace.

90
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,101
When am I ever gonna feel
glamorous enough to wear it?

91
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,938
Giving Leo a bath?
Feeding him his oatmeal?

92
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,361
What about his truck?

93
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,072
He's not gonna be cannonballing
down the highway anytime soon.

94
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,867
- The police impounded it.
- We can get it back.

95
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,244
They said if it was used
in the commission of a crime

96
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,997
it becomes property of the state.

97
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:10,168
- He wasn't charged with anything.
- I didn't make the rules.

98
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,170
Okay, okay.

99
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,005
It's like you're blaming me
for something.

100
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:18,218
I'm not blaming you. Come on.
Take it easy.

101
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:24,015
Leo was into a lot of different stuff
with a lot of different people.

102
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,435
He was in it for the money.

103
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,606
Bobby, look around you.
You really think that Leo had money?

104
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,901
Yes, I do.
Having a look at this checkbook,

105
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,113
I don't think he ever stepped foot
into a bank.

106
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,031
He must have been hiding it
somewhere.

107
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,664
He's alive.

108
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,459
New shoes.

109
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,588
Bobby, he's alive.

110
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,902
- He ain't alive, Shelly.
- But he talked.

111
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,156
It's only... That was a burp.
He probably has gas.

112
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,159
You call that a burp?

113
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,829
New shoes.

114
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:37,088
Did he buy any shoes lately
by any chance?

115
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,632
No.

116
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,011
He had me take in a pair of boots
for repair.

117
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,639
- When?
- Last week.

118
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,185
- Have you got a receipt?
- Yeah, why?

119
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,354
I don't know.
Shelly, go get that receipt.

120
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,403
New shoes.

121
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,741
Want some new shoes, Leo?

122
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,703
Give us what we want,
I'll buy you the whole damn shoe store.

123
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,545
New shoes.

124
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,012
Daddy, I know about
One-Eyed Jack's.

125
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,602
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

126
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,855
I know about Blackie,
I know about Emory Battis,

127
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,692
I know about Ronette,
and I know about Laura.

128
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,657
Okay.

129
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,701
I was there. I saw you.

130
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,247
Uh-huh.

131
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,416
You remember Prudence?

132
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,920
I wore a little white mask.

133
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,850
I need to ask you some questions.

134
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,395
Ask away.

135
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,440
How long have you owned
One-Eyed Jack's?

136
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,655
Five years.

137
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,493
Did you know Laura worked there?

138
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,996
She was only there for a brief time.

139
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,331
- Did you know?
- Yes.

140
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,293
Did you in any way encourage her
to work there?

141
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,255
No. I had no idea.

142
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,049
She asked if she could work
in the department store.

143
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,844
Battis sent her without my knowing.

144
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,975
Did you sleep with her?

145
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,238
Did you?

146
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,998
Yes.

147
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,220
Did you kill her?

148
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,692
I loved her.

149
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,805
Norma, can I talk to you
for a second?

150
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,350
Sure. What's up?

151
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,143
Um...

152
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,314
With Leo coming home and all...

153
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,651
...I'm supposed to be there
to watch him.

154
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,072
And it looks like
it's gonna be a full-time thing.

155
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:38,079
So I was thinking

156
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,915
that I have to quit my job.

157
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,378
Just for a little while anyway.

158
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,589
I'm sorry.

159
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,720
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna do this.

160
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,851
It's all right, sweetheart.

161
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,731
I just feel so bad.

162
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,611
I love you. I love working here.

163
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,032
I don't wanna let you down.

164
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,827
You're not gonna let me down.

165
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,039
I'm not?

166
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:26,878
Look, Shelly, you've got your own life
to worry about.

167
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,213
I'll be fine here.

168
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:33,217
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

169
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,888
Now, you look after yourself.

170
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,640
When you're ready,
you can come right back.

171
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,019
It'll be like you haven't even
missed a day.

172
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,607
You'll let me come back?

173
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,402
You just try to take a job someplace
else and see what happens.

174
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,368
I don't know what to say.

175
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,332
Don't say anything.

176
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,681
And I told him I'd been traveling
with my parents,

177
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,268
but now I wanted to register
for spring semester.

178
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,271
Oh, Eddie, let's sit at the counter.

179
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,234
I'm just dying for a chocolate shake,
aren't you?

180
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,153
Hi, Norma.

181
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:38,783
Say, how long have you
been working here?

182
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,120
Well, it's 20 years this April.

183
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, you kidder.

184
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,919
What a kidder. Heh, heh, heh.

185
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:55,383
Well, it's been about, uh, six weeks,
isn't that right, Norma?

186
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,719
- Huh?
- About six weeks.

187
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:04,016
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
- Well, you see?

188
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,062
When your parents drag you off
to Europe or someplace for a month,

189
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,525
then when you get back,
it's like you've been away forever.

190
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,822
Two chocolate shakes,
please, Norma.

191
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,994
- Coffee for me.
- Extra whipped cream on mine.

192
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,495
Hi.

193
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,792
- What's your name?
- Shelly.

194
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,005
Are you in our class at school?

195
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,800
I don't think so.

196
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,178
Oh.

197
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,433
I'll get the shake and coffee.

198
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,983
- Europe?
- Yeah.

199
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,777
My parents loved it so much
they're still there.

200
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,030
Can you believe it?

201
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:03,910
And they said it was okay
for me to stay over at Eddie's.

202
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,997
Is it your parents' house
or mine, Eddie?

203
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,582
That's right.

204
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:16,005
Oh, say, Norma,
you're not mad or anything

205
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:21,260
because Eddie's sort of taking me out,
are you?

206
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:25,765
You and Ed? No. No.
Why should I be?

207
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:29,810
Oh, no reason.
Eddie told me you broke up.

208
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,564
It's just that...

209
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,485
...I'm just so sweet on him.

210
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,910
- Isn't he just the dreamiest?
- Nadine.

211
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,290
I can't wait
for the start of football season.

212
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,753
- Can you?
- No. Can't wait.

213
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,922
Me neither.

214
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:01,384
I am just so happy.

215
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,637
- Oh, Nadine.
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

216
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,224
- How'd you do that?
- There goes another one.

217
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,061
There must've been a crack
in this glass from before.

218
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,772
- Golly.
- Don't count on it.

219
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,775
I'm so clumsy lately.

220
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,362
I can hardly believe it.

221
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,323
Shelly, get those Band-Aids,
and I'll get a towel.

222
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,122
Oh, Eddie.

223
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,835
I am so happy

224
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:42,049
I could just kiss you to death.

225
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,401
Oh, boy, Nadine.

226
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,710
I think she's at the diner. Shelly.

227
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,838
Shelly.

228
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:29,764
There he is, Mike.
The late Leo Johnson.

229
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,071
- Hank did this?
- He sure as hell did.

230
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,032
He shot him through that window
right there.

231
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,454
Leo, I went to the shoe shop.

232
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:58,000
I showed them the ticket,
and look what they gave me.

233
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:04,673
- New shoes.
- No, you knucklehead, old shoes.

234
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,426
Leo, he gets pretty fixated.

235
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,513
I hope he gets permanently fixated.

236
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,225
I know you too damn well, Leo.

237
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:18,813
Something about these shoes,
isn't there? Huh?

238
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,607
There's something
with these shoes.

239
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,615
I heard about people, you know,
muling stuff in their boot.

240
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,867
What, do you think
I didn't check these out?

241
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,994
Would you get a hammer?

242
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,706
Don't go anywhere, Leo.

243
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,518
Oh, my God.

244
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,241
- What is that, a tape?
- Don't.

245
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,620
Quit spitting, man.

246
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,042
Well, it's not money.

247
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,422
But who knows?

248
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,648
Diane, it's 2:47 p.m.

249
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,026
I'm in the conference room
at the sheriff's station

250
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,070
with the remains
of Laura Palmer's secret diary.

251
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,448
A great deal of it
has been mutilated.

252
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,325
Much of what I've been able
to decipher

253
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,827
supports the contention
of the one-armed man.

254
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,206
There are repeated references
to a Bob.

255
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,334
He was a threatening presence
in her life from early adolescence.

256
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:09,215
There are intimations of abuse
and molestation on a regular basis.

257
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:13,260
He is referred to,
on more than one occasion,

258
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,930
as a friend of her father's.

259
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,681
And I just uncovered this entry

260
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,643
dated less than two weeks
before her death:

261
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:25,397
"Someday I'm gonna tell the world
about Ben Horne.

262
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,984
I'm gonna tell them
who Ben Horne really is."

263
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:32,988
Yes?

264
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,744
- Audrey.
- I had to see you.

265
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,081
- I'm sorry if I'm interrupting you.
- How are you feeling?

266
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,251
- I spoke with my father.
- Yeah?

267
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,587
He was sleeping with her.

268
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,798
With Laura.

269
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,260
I don't know for how long,
maybe quite a while.

270
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,845
Holy smokes.

271
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,890
She was up at One-Eyed Jack's,
working there.

272
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,018
And he owns the place,
that's what I found out.

273
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,188
- He told you this?
- Yes.

274
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,109
What are you gonna do?

275
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,778
Harry.

276
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,906
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna arrest him?

277
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,828
Audrey, I don't want you
to say a word about this to anyone.

278
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:26,417
- Okay.
- Okay. Now, go on home.

279
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,719
What's going on?

280
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,888
Without chemicals he points.

281
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,434
This morning at the Great Northern,
Mike reached for his arm and fainted

282
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,563
just when a certain person
walked into the room.

283
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,317
Harry, we need a warrant.

284
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,862
A warrant for the arrest
of Benjamin Horne.

285
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,334
Good news, Mr. Tojamura.

286
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,253
My brother, Jerry,
spoke to your people in Osaka,

287
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,922
checked your references
at the Tokyo bank,

288
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,176
and the answer to your proposal,
my good friend,

289
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,012
is a big thumbs up.

290
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:24,224
We appreciate your promptness.

291
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,311
Speaking for the entire community
of Twin Peaks,

292
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,938
I cannot tell you how pleased we are

293
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,525
to welcome you
into the Ghostwood fold.

294
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:36,028
Thank you so much.

295
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:41,450
- Contract. For your perusal.
- And a fast approval I...

296
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,787
Sheriff.

297
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,250
- What is this?
- This is police business.

298
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,002
We'd like you to come with us.

299
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,090
Fine. I happen to be in a meeting.

300
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:59,176
Could you be a little more specific?

301
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:05,307
You're wanted for questioning
in the murder of Laura Palmer.

302
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,810
Is that specific enough for you?

303
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,777
You're insane. Insane.

304
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,446
Mr. Tojamura, I'm sure that this
is some dreadful mistake.

305
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,490
You can come quietly

306
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,576
or we can drag you through your lobby
in handcuffs.

307
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,664
Cooper, is this some sort
of sick joke?

308
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,792
Because if it is,
I know people in high places.

309
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,378
You'd better do what he says.

310
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,969
Go away.

311
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,305
Get out of here. Go on, go on.

312
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,350
I'm gonna go out for a sandwich.

313
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,062
No! No! No!

314
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:58,736
No! No!

315
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,531
You...

316
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,745
No! You can't do this to me.

317
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:12,082
- It's already done.
- You...

318
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,103
Leland.

319
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,550
Take him down to the holding cell.

320
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:20,002
We don't know what will happen
or when,

321
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:24,673
but there are owls
in the Roadhouse.

322
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,176
The Roadhouse.

323
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:35,309
Something is happening,
isn't it, Margaret?

324
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,729
Yes.

325
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,980
Oh!

326
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,907
Say, look here, buster,
you just watch it.

327
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:36,078
Since the moment we met,
I have been strangely attracted to you.

328
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,206
You just better get the hell out of here,
mister.

329
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,794
There's
something about your eyes, so warm...

330
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,712
...and deep.

331
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,800
And blue as the sky.

332
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:57,474
Dummy, it's me. It's me.

333
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,352
Catherine?

334
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,733
You look terrible.

335
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:18,996
Just terrible. Ha, ha, ha.

336
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:56,927
Tell your heart that I'm the one

337
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:07,104
Tell your heart it's me

338
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,662
- You heard about Harold Smith?
- Yeah.

339
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,126
It's not anybody's fault.

340
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,669
He was a sick man.

341
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,881
I think he was hurt inside
in a way I couldn't figure out.

342
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,970
Everybody's hurt inside.

343
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:47,519
His whole life was in that house,
and I violated that.

344
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,314
You were just trying to find out
about Laura.

345
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:58,488
James, he's dead.

346
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,242
He didn't deserve that.

347
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:08,665
Shadow in my house

348
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:14,254
The man, he has brown eyes

349
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,340
Sheriff Truman.

350
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,600
Love moves me

351
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:39,446
I want you
Rockin' back inside my heart

352
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,740
Maddy's leaving.

353
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,243
She is?

354
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,080
Yeah, she's gonna go home.

355
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,462
That's weird.
She never said anything to me.

356
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:14,898
Tell your heart you make me cry

357
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:26,576
Tell your heart don't let me die

358
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:41,216
I want you
Rockin' back inside my heart

359
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:47,097
Rockin' back inside my heart

360
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:55,855
Shadow in my house

361
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:08,994
Dust is dancing in the space

362
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:20,797
A dog and bird are far away

363
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,561
The sun comes up and down
Each day

364
00:38:50,411 --> 00:39:01,254
It is happening again.

365
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,068
Hm.

366
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,313
Aunt Sarah?

367
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,609
Uncle Leland?

368
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,571
Aunt Sarah, Uncle Leland,
what is that smell?

369
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,824
It smells like something's burning.

370
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,618
Oh, my gosh. Aunt Sarah?

371
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,061
Shh! Shh!

372
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:56,703
Somebody, help me!

373
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,936
Help me!

374
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,132
Laura. Laura.

375
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,512
Laura. Laura. Laura.

376
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:01,392
Laura, my baby.

377
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,021
Laura. Laura.

378
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,282
Laura.

379
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,786
Laura.

380
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,754
Leland says...

381
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:16,801
...you're going back to Missoula,
Montana!

382
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:41,427
Dust is dancing in the space

383
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,978
I'm so sorry.

384
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:05,702
The sun comes up and down
Each day

385
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:20,967
The river flows out to the sea

386
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:31,352
Love, don't go away

387
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:36,065
Come back this way

388
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:40,445
Come back and stay

389
00:45:40,612 --> 00:47:28,135
Forever and ever
