1
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:29,018
These people.

2
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:30,603
Pathetic.

3
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,774
I already read that one anyway.

4
00:00:34,982 --> 00:00:36,942
Kleinman has better magazines.

5
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:40,362
You know, you guys
really don't need to hang around.

6
00:00:40,571 --> 00:00:42,990
We won't even get the results
till next week.

7
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:45,785
Buddy, we're gonna be here.
You kidding me?

8
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:48,704
<i>It is a full PETICT, correct?</i>

9
00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:53,000
<i>You definitely want the PETICT
and not just the PET.</i>

10
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:56,670
<i>Yeah, it's a PETICT.</i>

11
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,340
Good. That's what you want.

12
00:00:59,548 --> 00:01:02,885
Some places skimp
and they only do the PET.

13
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:05,930
I'm not naming any names.

14
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:10,184
I just still don't understand
why you don't go to Kleinman.

15
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:12,061
This is where Walt's doctor is.

16
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:14,939
Well, with us, you wouldn't
have to wait until next week...

17
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:16,899
...to get the results.

18
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:20,069
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.

19
00:01:20,277 --> 00:01:21,862
I could take one look at Walt's...

20
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:24,407
...and tell you immediately
how he's doing.

21
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:27,410
- Really.
- Doctors like people to think...

22
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:31,080
...that they're so much smarter
than the technicians...

23
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:35,418
...but you would be surprised
how much they come to us for input.

24
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,925
Well, never turn down a chance
to hit the bathroom, huh?

25
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:45,177
Excuse me.

26
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:58,315
You all right in there?

27
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:01,360
Yeah.

28
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:06,741
Hey, you okay?

29
00:02:06,949 --> 00:02:08,451
Yes.

30
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:12,872
I'm fine, thank you.

31
00:02:37,146 --> 00:02:40,232
Sir, you can go back to your
changing room and get dressed.

32
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:45,488
- So how'd we do?
- You did fine.

33
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,826
- See anything?
- I'm just a technician, Mr. White.

34
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:53,871
Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results
with you next week.

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,498
Sorry.

36
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:37,331
Actually, the money-laundering aspect
is fairly straightforward.

37
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,127
But I gotta tell you,
the not-telling-your-wife aspect?

38
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:44,004
Most people wanna know
why they suddenly got rich.

39
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:48,175
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.

40
00:03:48,384 --> 00:03:50,386
How much time they giving you?

41
00:03:51,345 --> 00:03:52,930
Weeks.

42
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,724
Maybe.

43
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:56,392
Sorry to hear it.

44
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,229
I was hoping we could
make some real money together.

45
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:03,232
Oh, well.
Look, let's crunch some numbers.

46
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:06,152
How much money
are we laundering?

47
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,489
At this time, $16,000.

48
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:13,909
How long you been doing this?

49
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:17,413
We've had some
extenuating circumstances.

50
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:19,081
Yeah, apparently.

51
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,628
All right, 16,000 laundered
at 75 cents on the dollar...

52
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:28,382
...minus my fee,
which is 17 percent...

53
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:31,761
...comes to $9960.

54
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:35,598
Congratulations, you just left
your family a secondhand Subaru.

55
00:04:35,806 --> 00:04:39,351
Well, we'll just have to cook more.
A lot more.

56
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,937
Yeah, that's my legal opinion.

57
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:45,399
Make hay
while the sun is still shining.

58
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,700
You know, we should do something
this weekend.

59
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:58,204
You know,
get our minds off the test results.

60
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:02,917
Actually, I...

61
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:08,589
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

62
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:15,763
- Really?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,392
You know, I never did call her.

64
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:26,565
You're expecting the news
from the scan to be bad.

65
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:33,322
God, Walt.

66
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:37,410
I need you to stay positive
with me here.

67
00:05:37,618 --> 00:05:40,996
I am. Positive is good.

68
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:42,415
I'm all for positive...

69
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:47,086
...but positive doesn't change facts,
all right?

70
00:05:47,294 --> 00:05:48,671
It...

71
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:51,757
It doesn't change the need
to be prepared.

72
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:53,342
I know.

73
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:56,929
Walt, I'm just trying
to be hopeful, okay?

74
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:59,223
You know, forgive me.

75
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:03,561
Look...

76
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:06,689
...I need to know Mom's
going to leave you something if--

77
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:08,482
If...

78
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,693
...I'm no longer around.

79
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:15,156
I just need to get that straight,
that's all.

80
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:21,704
And believe me,
I'm gonna earn every penny of it too.

81
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:26,834
Complaining about her nurses
the entire time.

82
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:31,797
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."

83
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,552
A 30-minute discourse...

84
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:40,222
...about how the sugar packets
are suddenly disappearing.

85
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:43,726
And, oh, she's counting
every one of them, you know.

86
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:50,232
I'll be lucky
if I get a word in edgewise.

87
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:09,043
I actually think the news from the scan
is gonna be good.

88
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:13,589
Perhaps you should prepare for that.

89
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:16,884
Yeah.

90
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:29,939
- We should do something.
- Yeah, we should.

91
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:32,608
No, something else.

92
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:35,611
We should go somewhere.

93
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:38,614
Have you been
to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?

94
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:40,950
Is that the one with the A-bombs?

95
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:45,705
Georgia O'Keeffe.

96
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:47,832
She's a painter.

97
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:50,418
You've never heard
of Georgia O'Keeffe?

98
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:52,503
No, is that bad?

99
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:57,466
- Boy, you need some educating.
- Yes, yes, I do. Come here.

100
00:07:57,675 --> 00:08:00,803
Why don't we go up to Santa Fe?
We'll make a day of it.

101
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:04,598
You wanna go all the way to Santa Fe
for a museum?

102
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:07,393
So romantic.

103
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:10,271
Yup, we're going. Get up.

104
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:15,317
Why can't we just go to the movies
or putt-putt?

105
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:17,820
It's the shit.

106
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:20,114
A little culture won't kill you.

107
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:23,909
Besides, you might like it.
A lot of her paintings look like vaginae.

108
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:26,412
Really?

109
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,752
- Is there still cereal?
- Yeah.

110
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:42,887
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

111
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:45,848
<i>Where the hell are you?
Pick up the phone.</i>

112
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:49,268
<i>- Hello? Jesse, pick up--
- Hold on, hold on.</i>

113
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:51,520
Sorry, one sec.

114
00:08:56,692 --> 00:08:59,278
<i>- What?
- I've been trying to reach you.</i>

115
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:00,654
Where's your drop phone?

116
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:05,451
<i>- I've been busy.
- Well, clear your social calendar.</i>

117
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:09,205
<i>- We have to cook.
- What? Today?</i>

118
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:11,832
<i>No, you'll need today at least
to gather supplies.</i>

119
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,293
<i>Now, we're going to need
all new glassware...</i>

120
00:09:14,502 --> 00:09:17,004
...heating mantles,
about a hundred pounds of ice.

121
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:20,091
Do you have a paper and pencil?
You should be writing this down.

122
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:23,260
You wanna go shopping,
go do it yourself, all right? I got plans.

123
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:26,222
<i>Smoking marijuana,
eating Cheetos and masturbating...</i>

124
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,933
...do not constitute plans
in my book.

125
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:31,227
<i>Well, screw you and your book, man,
all right?</i>

126
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:34,397
I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe,
not like you need to know.

127
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:38,818
- You're going to a museum, huh?
- Yeah. Georgia O'Keeffe.

128
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:42,071
<i>- Georgia O'Keeffe?
- She's a painter, duh.</i>

129
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,739
She does these vagina pictures.

130
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:47,076
Or paintings, or just painted.
I don't know.

131
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:48,703
What are you even talking about?

132
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:52,081
Look, man, why am I even
explaining myself to you, all right?

133
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:54,375
It's none of your damn business
what I'm doing.

134
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,920
All you need to know is I ain't cooking
or shopping or whatever the hell.

135
00:09:58,129 --> 00:09:59,588
Let me explain something to you.

136
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:02,842
You and I need to cook
through to next Tuesday.

137
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,263
- Tuesday? Four days straight?
- Like it or not, we have no choice.

138
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:10,766
<i>Yeah? And why exactly is that?</i>

139
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:14,937
Our methylamine. It's going bad.

140
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:17,398
<i>- What?
- It's losing its chemical potency.</i>

141
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:20,735
Now, unless stealing another barrel
sounds good to you...

142
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,236
<i>Hell, no.</i>

143
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:25,072
All right, we have to act fast,
before it goes to waste.

144
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:27,491
<i>You have a paper and pencil?</i>

145
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:32,788
<i>- Come on.
- All right, all right. Go.</i>

146
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,875
Okay, six mantles. Mantle? Mantle?

147
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,294
What do you mean, mantle?
You mean like Mickey?

148
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:40,546
I really wish
you didn't have to do this.

149
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:43,174
Me too.

150
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:45,134
But I'll be back before you know it...

151
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:48,054
...and you can always call
if you need me.

152
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:52,850
What, and risk talking to your mother?
Have to be some emergency.

153
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:04,779
Love you.

154
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:09,617
- Fly safe, okay?
- Okay.

155
00:11:32,556 --> 00:11:35,142
<i>The white zone is for immediate
loading and unloading...</i>

156
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:36,727
<i>...of passengers only.</i>

157
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:38,813
<i>No parking.</i>

158
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:50,199
<i>Attention, passengers.:
Please maintain visual contact...</i>

159
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:52,743
<i>...with your personal belongings

<i>Any bags left unattended
will be confiscated...</i>

161
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:57,540
<i>...by airport personnel.</i>

162
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:08,134
You brought a meth lab
to the airport?

163
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:10,970
What? You said we were in a hurry.
I saved us a trip.

164
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:13,347
Yeah. Did you get everything?
All six?

165
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:15,891
- Yeah.
- With reflux condensers?

166
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,685
Yes. Like I said, yes.

167
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:22,565
- Just go. Drive. Go, go.
- Okay.

168
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:26,819
Good morning to you too, man.

169
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:26,629
- Stupid--
- Three entire bags of Funyuns?

170
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:29,173
What? Funyuns are awesome.

171
00:13:29,382 --> 00:13:31,425
- God.
- Hey, more for me.

172
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:34,512
How about something
with some protein maybe?

173
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,014
Something green, huh?

174
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:41,644
Man, I'm getting no service.

175
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:45,272
How are you even alive?

176
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:49,902
Hey, yo, check your phone.
You get any bars?

177
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:51,821
Yeah, I've got a signal.

178
00:13:54,782 --> 00:13:58,577
- Hey, let me use yours, would you?
- Absolutely not.

179
00:13:58,786 --> 00:14:00,955
I have to assume
Skyler checks my phone records.

180
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:03,207
- You know that.
- It's not business, all right?

181
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,709
- It's personal.
- Oh, personal.

182
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:07,712
- What, female?
- Maybe.

183
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,755
Absolutely. That's all I need.

184
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:12,258
Skyler hits redial
and some stripper answers.

185
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:16,178
Look, she's not a stripper, okay?
Dickwad.

186
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:19,181
Sorry. My wife checks.

187
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:23,352
- Drinking water?
- Yup.

188
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:25,229
Is that all we've got?

189
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:29,358
Ten gallons?
What, you plan on taking a bath in it?

190
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,532
Oh, God.

191
00:14:42,621 --> 00:14:46,375
No, not there.
That is our workstation.

192
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:49,879
- Oh, our "workstation."
- That's right.

193
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:54,300
Why don't you try to find a place
where it won't get lost?

194
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:56,052
Considering it's our only set...

195
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,221
...and we are a million miles
from nowhere.

196
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:08,397
Why don't you try
sticking them up your ass sideways?

197
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,522
Two-point-three-five pounds.

198
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:16,484
Two-point-three-five.

199
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:18,361
That's the last of it.

200
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:24,367
- How many total?
- Nineteen.

201
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:27,578
So dollar-wise?

202
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:29,413
How much?

203
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:32,750
Well, median weight 2.2 pounds...

204
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:37,713
...that's 41.8,
call that 42 pounds, at...

205
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:40,299
- What are we selling for these days?
- Forty a pound.

206
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:43,302
- Forty thousand dollars?
- Hey, you said raise the prices.

207
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:46,389
All right, that's 40 times 42...

208
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:49,642
...minus distribution charges...

209
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:53,062
What?

210
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:55,981
What?

211
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:59,068
Six hundred seventy-two
thousand dollars.

212
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:01,904
- All in?
- No.

213
00:18:03,197 --> 00:18:04,740
Each.

214
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:06,367
Each?

215
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:10,246
- Each.
- Six hundred and--?

216
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:12,915
Seventy-two thousand dollars each.

217
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:16,585
Each. Yes! Hell, yeah!

218
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:21,507
Hey, come high, baby.
Come on. Yes. Come on.

219
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:25,553
Yes! Yes!

220
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:32,435
Well, there goes the generator.

221
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:34,979
I think that's it for the gas.

222
00:18:35,187 --> 00:18:36,689
Perfect timing, yo.

223
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:39,775
- How do you figure that?
- What do you mean?

224
00:18:39,984 --> 00:18:40,985
We're done cooking.

225
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:44,113
I am not done
until this barrel is empty.

226
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:45,489
Look at this.

227
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:48,951
I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons
of methylamine.

228
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,288
- Come on, where's your ambition?
- Jesus. Seriously?

229
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:54,790
We are way ahead of schedule, man,
all right?

230
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:57,960
Plus the genny needs gas,
we're almost out of propane...

231
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:01,088
...and my back is killing me
from that piece-of-crap cot.

232
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:03,883
Come on, can we at least
just take the night off?

233
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:06,635
Look, I don't have to take you back
till Tuesday, right?

234
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:09,388
So we come back tomorrow,
strap on the sizzle...

235
00:19:09,597 --> 00:19:11,098
...and glass up the rest.

236
00:19:11,307 --> 00:19:12,308
Come on.

237
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:15,394
There's gotta be a Denny's
out there someplace.

238
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:17,271
Grand Slam?

239
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,648
Hot shower?

240
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:20,983
A bed?

241
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,700
- Separate rooms.
- Yeah, that's a given.

242
00:19:32,536 --> 00:19:34,288
What the hell?

243
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:38,042
What the...? The battery's dead.

244
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:44,799
Jesse, back when I asked you
to put the keys in a safe place...

245
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:46,634
...where did you put them?

246
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:51,597
- I left them right here in the ignition.
- Son of a bitch.

247
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:53,974
Whoa, whoa, no,
this is not my fault, all right?

248
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:55,726
- The buzzer didn't buzz.
- The what?

249
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:58,187
The buzzer that buzzes
when you put the keys in...

250
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:00,022
...to let you know the battery's on.

251
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:01,899
I know that. It didn't buzz.

252
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:04,402
Look, I didn't turn the key
or anything, all right?

253
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,530
I'm not stupid.
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

254
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:09,865
I did not. It's faulty.
It's a faulty mechanism.

255
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:12,702
Is this just a genetic thing with you?
Is it congenital?

256
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,538
Did your mother drop you
on your head when you were a baby?

257
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:16,831
The buzzer did not buzz.

258
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,208
And you're the one
that made me move the keys.

259
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,043
Yes, I see your point.

260
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:23,879
Your imbecility being what it is,
I should've known to say:

261
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:27,299
"Jesse, don't leave the keys
in the ignition the entire two days."

262
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:30,136
I wanted to leave them
on the counter, bitch.

263
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:32,722
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.

264
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,849
- Jesus.
- Okay, just...

265
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:42,982
All right, so we need
to jump the battery somehow.

266
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,817
Okay.

267
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:46,235
How?

268
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:57,621
You gonna be okay?

269
00:20:58,122 --> 00:20:59,999
Oh, damn it.

270
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:03,377
What's it taste like?

271
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,046
Bad, huh?

272
00:21:12,344 --> 00:21:14,555
This is good.
This is good. Right here.

273
00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:17,808
Okay. There.

274
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:21,771
Here. Red to red, black to black.

275
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:31,405
Positive, negative.
All right. Start it up.

276
00:21:35,034 --> 00:21:37,286
What the hell's wrong
with this thing?

277
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:40,414
- You have to really pull.
- I am.

278
00:21:40,623 --> 00:21:42,416
No, really pull, not like a girl.

279
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,294
You know what? Pull this.
I am pulling.

280
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:48,964
It just needs to warm up a little.
All right.

281
00:21:51,342 --> 00:21:52,468
Oh, my God.

282
00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:55,805
Oh, jeez.

283
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:23,791
Well done, Jesse, as always. Just...

284
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:26,627
Well done.

285
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:29,755
God.

286
00:22:51,318 --> 00:22:54,739
Come on, you bitches.

287
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:57,033
Hear me now.

288
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:00,619
Damn it.

289
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:09,462
Stupid.

290
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:15,801
Okay, now we have to use
your phone.

291
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,137
This is ruined. Do you understand?
Just ruined.

292
00:23:18,637 --> 00:23:20,347
You hooked it up wrong
and blew it up.

293
00:23:20,556 --> 00:23:23,309
No, no, no.
That is not what happened.

294
00:23:23,517 --> 00:23:24,643
How do you know?

295
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:28,230
What I know is that I wasn't the one
who dumped out the last of our water.

296
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,191
- That's what I know.
- There was a fire.

297
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:32,234
Excuse me for thinking on my feet.

298
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:34,528
Is that what you were--?
You were thinking?

299
00:23:34,737 --> 00:23:36,572
Now that we have
identified the problem--

300
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:38,991
You and thinking,
that's the problem.

301
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,246
Look, somebody is going to
have to pick us up, all right?

302
00:23:44,455 --> 00:23:46,707
Your wife is not gonna notice
one little call.

303
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:50,586
Mr. White, come on.

304
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:52,254
God.

305
00:23:52,463 --> 00:23:57,551
All right, look, just make it snappy.

306
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,846
- Roaming drains the battery.
- All right.

307
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,851
Yo, Skinny, hey.

308
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,230
Yeah, yeah. Listen, man,
I need you to come pick us up.

309
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:13,901
Now, all right? We're stuck out here.
You got a pen for directions?

310
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,945
Look, pencil's fine, retard.

311
00:24:16,153 --> 00:24:18,614
Just something to write with.
It doesn't matter.

312
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:20,157
All right, so you ready?

313
00:24:20,366 --> 00:24:24,453
All right, so you're gonna head west
on the 40 for like, what, 30 miles?

314
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:29,291
And you're gonna go past the casino
with the big arrows in the parking lot.

315
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,335
All right--
No, big arrows, giant arrows.

316
00:24:31,544 --> 00:24:33,754
They light up and blink.
You can't miss them.

317
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:37,216
Then you're gonna wanna take it slow,
because there's this dirt road.

318
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:40,302
It's right before the white sign
with a 3 on it, okay?

319
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:43,264
Now you're gonna be way, way out
in the boonies, okay?

320
00:24:43,472 --> 00:24:47,727
Like crazy far, so just keep heading
down that dirt road for like what?

321
00:24:47,935 --> 00:24:49,729
About another 15 miles.

322
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:52,690
- Really? That far?
- Yeah. Hurry up. The battery.

323
00:24:52,898 --> 00:24:55,985
All right, just go down that road
for like 15 more miles, all right?

324
00:24:56,193 --> 00:24:59,905
I mean, we're way the hell out here.
All right?

325
00:25:00,114 --> 00:25:03,617
Oh, and, yo, hey, listen.
Bring water.

326
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:05,453
Leave now.

327
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,496
Here.

328
00:25:07,705 --> 00:25:09,331
He's coming.

329
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:18,174
There was this guy
on the Discovery Channel...

330
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:20,801
...who broke his leg
mountain biking...

331
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,679
...and he had to drink urine for...

332
00:25:23,888 --> 00:25:26,766
You know,
just until the forest ranger found him.

333
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:33,105
He said it tasted like really hot,
really old soda.

334
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:39,028
Look, we should just call, you know?

335
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:43,032
I'll be quick, just be like,
"Yo, where are you?"

336
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:46,869
All right.

337
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,006
Come on.

338
00:26:00,883 --> 00:26:03,177
Yo. Yo, where are you?

339
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,679
Oh, so you saw the white sign?

340
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:08,432
Yes, he's almost here.

341
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:12,436
Oh, man.
We're getting really freaked out.

342
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:15,106
All right, so you're on the dirt road?

343
00:26:15,314 --> 00:26:17,316
He's on the dirt road. Good. Good.

344
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:20,611
You just crossed the river?
Yeah. Have you seen anything?

345
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,905
Wait, wait. What river?

346
00:26:24,073 --> 00:26:25,491
Yeah, hey, yo, what river?

347
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,244
What the hell river you talking about?
There's no river.

348
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:30,663
Hey, yo, Pete. Yo, Pete, can you--?

349
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:34,583
Phone's dead.

350
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,132
Now what?

351
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:47,179
Mr. White, what now?

352
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:52,017
Oh, come on. Seriously?

353
00:27:25,551 --> 00:27:27,303
What's this?

354
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,599
I'm trying to...

355
00:27:32,058 --> 00:27:34,560
...trickle-charge the battery.

356
00:27:35,394 --> 00:27:37,355
Seriously?

357
00:27:37,772 --> 00:27:39,815
Just by turning that thing?

358
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:41,817
The commutator.

359
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:44,987
It's the part
which generates the electricity.

360
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:50,159
Usually this little piston engine
turns it...

361
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:54,455
...but considering that it's lying here
completely totalled...

362
00:27:59,043 --> 00:28:00,795
Anyway.

363
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:05,841
Apply a little elbow grease.

364
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:10,429
It'll take longer, a lot longer...

365
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:13,516
...but theoretically...

366
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:16,644
...it should work.

367
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,147
Theoretically.

368
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,862
It has to work.

369
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:29,573
You understand?

370
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,960
Can I try?

371
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:47,216
Yeah.

372
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:24,170
How much longer?

373
00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:28,007
I don't know.

374
00:29:43,356 --> 00:29:45,107
Now?

375
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,942
Hey.

376
00:29:47,777 --> 00:29:49,570
Mr. White.

377
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,293
Hey.

378
00:30:05,795 --> 00:30:07,171
Yeah?

379
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,802
Yo, man, you hanging in?

380
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:15,513
Yeah, I'm good.

381
00:30:17,848 --> 00:30:21,394
It's gotta be ready by now, right?

382
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,941
No, give it a little longer...

383
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:29,235
...just to make sure we're--

384
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,377
Methylamine doesn't spoil...

385
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:48,045
...does it?

386
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:54,844
No. That's not why we're here.

387
00:31:06,856 --> 00:31:08,399
Yo.

388
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:10,443
Lie much?

389
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,161
Here, push.

390
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,678
Okay, okay, okay.

391
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:40,556
Now.

392
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:43,684
Go on.

393
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,148
Please, please, please.

394
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,043
Yes. Yes.

395
00:32:12,338 --> 00:32:15,841
Come on. Damn. No, please, God.

396
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,552
No. God.

397
00:32:20,554 --> 00:32:23,682
Please. Please.

398
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:44,036
Why couldn't I have just gone
to Santa Fe?

399
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:47,206
Why? Why?

400
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,922
Mr. White.

401
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:56,757
Mr. White!

402
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,975
What are you doing?

403
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:09,311
Mr. White?

404
00:33:10,604 --> 00:33:12,523
Oh, God.

405
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:32,126
I have this coming.

406
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,172
What?

407
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:40,968
I have it coming.

408
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:45,097
I deserve this.

409
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:47,516
Hey, snap out of it.

410
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:51,687
All right, first off, everything you did,
you did for your family.

411
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,397
Right?

412
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:58,235
All I ever managed to do...

413
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:01,781
...was worry and disappoint them...

414
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,325
...and lie.

415
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,119
Oh, God.

416
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,247
All the lies.

417
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:13,959
I can't even...

418
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:17,171
I can't even keep them straight
in my head anymore.

419
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:21,050
You know what? Screw this.

420
00:34:21,258 --> 00:34:24,845
I'm walking. You can come or not.

421
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,350
Where's my other shoe?

422
00:34:30,893 --> 00:34:33,813
Jesse. Jesse.

423
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,859
Your body...

424
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:42,905
...is running dangerously low
on electrolytes.

425
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:48,202
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

426
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:50,871
And when they're gone...

427
00:34:51,414 --> 00:34:54,875
...your brain ceases to communicate
with your muscles.

428
00:34:55,584 --> 00:35:01,173
Your lungs stop breathing,
your heart stops pumping.

429
00:35:01,382 --> 00:35:05,386
You go marching out there...

430
00:35:05,594 --> 00:35:09,473
...and within an hour,
you will be dead.

431
00:35:09,682 --> 00:35:13,769
Okay, you need to cut out
all your loser crybaby crap right now...

432
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,896
...and think of something scientific.

433
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:19,358
Something--
Something scientific, right.

434
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:22,528
What? Come on, man.
You're smart, all right?

435
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:25,406
You made poison out of beans, yo.

436
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:28,868
All right, look. We got--

437
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:34,206
We got an entire lab right here,
all right?

438
00:35:34,415 --> 00:35:36,459
How about you take
some of these chemicals...

439
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,253
...and mix up some rocket fuel?

440
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:42,381
And we can just send up
a signal flare.

441
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,885
Or you make some kind of robot
to get us help...

442
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:48,804
...or a homing device...

443
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,848
...or build a new battery or...

444
00:35:51,057 --> 00:35:52,892
Or wait, no.

445
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,353
What if we just take some stuff
off of the RV...

446
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:59,023
...and build it into something
completely different?

447
00:35:59,231 --> 00:36:02,109
You know, like a...
Like a dune buggy.

448
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:05,780
And that way,
we can just dune-buggy or...

449
00:36:06,655 --> 00:36:10,951
What? Hey. What is it?

450
00:36:12,078 --> 00:36:13,496
What?

451
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:17,291
Do you have any money?

452
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,626
Change, I mean. Coins.

453
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:21,629
- Yeah, I got a bunch from the--
- Okay.

454
00:36:21,837 --> 00:36:23,672
- Yes.
- Gather them.

455
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,760
And washers and nuts and bolts
and screws...

456
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:31,347
...and whatever little pieces of metal
we can think of that is galvanized.

457
00:36:31,555 --> 00:36:35,142
It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.

458
00:36:35,351 --> 00:36:37,561
- Solid zinc, okay.
- And-- And bring me--

459
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,147
Bring me brake pads.

460
00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:43,943
The front wheels should have discs.
Take them off and bring them to me.

461
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:46,904
- Okay. Brake pads, okay.
- Brake pads.

462
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:52,493
What are we building?

463
00:36:53,285 --> 00:36:56,247
- You said it yourself.
- A robot?

464
00:36:57,206 --> 00:36:58,582
- A battery.
- Yes.

465
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,668
Move!

466
00:37:12,054 --> 00:37:16,100
This doesn't look like any battery
I ever saw.

467
00:37:16,308 --> 00:37:18,477
Well, trust me, it is a battery.

468
00:37:19,228 --> 00:37:22,440
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

469
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:26,569
Here. Cut up the last two sponges.

470
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,446
Remember the electrolytes?

471
00:37:29,822 --> 00:37:30,990
Well, think about it.

472
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,869
A battery is a galvanic cell.

473
00:37:35,077 --> 00:37:37,830
It's no more than an anode
and a cathode...

474
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,166
...separated by an electrolyte, right?

475
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,960
- Right.
- Yeah, well, anyway.

476
00:37:43,169 --> 00:37:46,797
Here. On one side,
you have mercuric oxide...

477
00:37:47,006 --> 00:37:49,216
...and graphite
from your brake pads.

478
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:53,596
This is the cathode.
This is the positive terminal.

479
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:58,059
This is where the supply of current
flows out from, you see?

480
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:00,895
Then... Here, I'll show you.

481
00:38:01,103 --> 00:38:03,647
On the opposite side is our anode.

482
00:38:04,106 --> 00:38:05,691
This.

483
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:08,652
It's zinc.

484
00:38:08,861 --> 00:38:13,949
It's what we find in our coins
and anything galvanized.

485
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:17,578
- So the sponge is the electrolyte?
- Yeah.

486
00:38:17,787 --> 00:38:21,665
Well, no, the potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte.

487
00:38:21,874 --> 00:38:25,961
But, yes, that's what I'm soaking
the sponges in.

488
00:38:26,962 --> 00:38:28,422
Good.

489
00:38:29,298 --> 00:38:34,220
Good. And now, what shall we use...

490
00:38:34,428 --> 00:38:37,098
...to conduct
this beautiful current with?

491
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:42,645
What one particular element
comes to mind?

492
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:50,319
Wire.

493
00:38:52,488 --> 00:38:53,989
Copper.

494
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,242
- Oh, I mean--
- Copper.

495
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,868
Right.

496
00:38:58,452 --> 00:39:02,957
The only question now is
will this supply enough current?

497
00:39:03,165 --> 00:39:06,085
And how many cells will we need?

498
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:09,171
We've only got material enough
for six.

499
00:39:14,593 --> 00:39:16,262
Okay.

500
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:22,309
Put the lid on. Wait. Positive.

501
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:23,978
All right.

502
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,940
Cathode.

503
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,655
Anode.

504
00:39:34,864 --> 00:39:37,867
Damn. That is good.

505
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:41,370
That is very good.
Okay. Here we go.

506
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:02,350
Come on.

507
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:49,021
<i>Attention, passengers.:
Please maintain visual contact...</i>

508
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,524
<i>...with your personal belongings
at all times.</i>

00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:54,235
<i>Any bags left unattended

510
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:56,195
How's the...?

511
00:40:58,447 --> 00:40:59,949
It's fine.

512
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:14,255
I know I can trust you to...

513
00:41:15,798 --> 00:41:17,591
Yeah.

514
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:22,221
Hey, whatever happens...

515
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,099
...your family will get your share.

516
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,520
Thank you.

517
00:41:38,487 --> 00:41:40,114
So...

518
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:47,121
...I'll be hearing from you, yeah?

519
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,460
Yeah.

520
00:42:11,187 --> 00:42:13,147
<i>How's everyone doing?</i>

521
00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:19,070
Is that baby ever gonna come out,
you think?

522
00:42:20,321 --> 00:42:24,325
- I know. I know, enough already. It's--
- I'm teasing.

523
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:26,494
Everything in its time.

524
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,956
Walt, I have your scan results.

525
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:35,878
- Yeah.
- You're showing signs of remission.

526
00:42:39,507 --> 00:42:42,093
- Oh, my God.
- I wanna clarify.

527
00:42:42,301 --> 00:42:45,012
There are misconceptions
about what remission signifies.

528
00:42:45,221 --> 00:42:47,598
It does not mean
that the patient is cured.

529
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,850
To classify someone
as in remission...

530
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:52,770
...we only need to determine
that the tumour hasn't grown.

531
00:42:52,978 --> 00:42:55,356
That it hasn't grown? Jesus.

532
00:42:56,065 --> 00:42:57,108
Technically speaking...

533
00:42:57,316 --> 00:43:00,361
...a tumour can remain
the exact same size it was before...

534
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:03,030
...and the patient
could still be in remission.

535
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:06,784
Now, in Walt's case,
with a stage lll adenocarcinoma...

536
00:43:06,992 --> 00:43:08,994
...I'd like to see, I hope to see...

537
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:12,832
...at least a 25- to 35-percent
reduction in tumour mass...

538
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,546
...something to tell me that the cancer
has responded to the therapy.

539
00:43:18,754 --> 00:43:20,548
Everybody still with me?

540
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:25,720
And how has my cancer responded?

541
00:43:25,928 --> 00:43:29,306
Walt, your tumour has shrunk
by 80 percent.

542
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:37,064
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

543
00:43:37,273 --> 00:43:39,525
Wait, I'm really... I'm confused.

544
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:42,153
Is--? Isn't 80 percent a lot?

545
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:47,408
- Mom, yeah.
- Yes, 80 percent is a lot.

546
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:50,745
- Okay, but, I'm-- Wait--
- Sweetheart, you were right.

547
00:43:50,953 --> 00:43:53,706
- It's very good news.
- It's very good news.

548
00:43:53,914 --> 00:43:56,959
- Oh, my God.
- My God, are you kidding me?

549
00:43:57,168 --> 00:44:01,380
Just when I try to get out,
they pull me back in.

550
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:11,807
That's great.

551
00:44:13,476 --> 00:44:16,687
Now, that cough is the other thing
we need to discuss.

552
00:44:16,896 --> 00:44:20,775
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

553
00:44:20,983 --> 00:44:24,111
It's okay. This is fairly common.

554
00:44:24,987 --> 00:44:26,697
See that scary-looking thing there?

555
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,743
That's tissue inflammation.
It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.

556
00:44:31,327 --> 00:44:34,205
It's usually not serious,
but it can produce a cough like that.

557
00:44:34,413 --> 00:44:36,499
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

558
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:39,627
Tissue inflammation? I...

559
00:44:39,835 --> 00:44:41,796
Are you sure about that? I mean, I--

560
00:44:42,004 --> 00:44:47,802
Because the other day,
I was coughing up some blood.

561
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,013
- What?
- You probably have a tear...

562
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:52,807
...in your oesophagus
from coughing.

563
00:44:53,015 --> 00:44:55,810
That can be serious.
You could rupture and bleed to death.

564
00:44:56,185 --> 00:44:59,397
This is something we're gonna have to
deal with before you leave today.

565
00:44:59,605 --> 00:45:02,483
Wait a minute. When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

566
00:45:02,692 --> 00:45:05,236
- I'm sorry, I just--
- No more secrets, Walt.

567
00:45:05,444 --> 00:45:09,156
With something like this,
you have to call me immediately.

568
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,536
Now, with these results,
we're not completely out of the woods.

569
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,663
But now at least
we have some options...

570
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:18,749
...the most important of which
is time.

571
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,253
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

572
00:45:22,461 --> 00:45:26,257
But for now, I'd say that you folks
have earned some celebrating.

573
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:31,595
- Yes.
- Yeah.

574
00:45:31,804 --> 00:45:32,972
Oh, my God.
