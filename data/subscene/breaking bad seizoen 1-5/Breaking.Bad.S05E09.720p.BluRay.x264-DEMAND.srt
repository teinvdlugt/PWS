1
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,677
That was nasty, man.

2
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,630
Hello, Carol.

3
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,556
- She's so cute.
- I know, isn't she?

4
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,189
She takes after her mother.

5
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,758
Well, thank goodness for that.

6
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,074
Okay, everybody,
since you were so good

7
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,355
and you ate all your dinner,
everybody.

8
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,357
Is sweetie hungry? Sweetie, pumpkin pie,
this one's for you. That one's for you.

9
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,554
She's got a lot more hair
than you do.

10
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,990
Yes. You wear that so well.
You do.

11
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,551
Look at what I have.
Special one for you.

12
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,070
Oh, my God, Skyler.
I'll take the pink one.

13
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,469
It's a pink one.

14
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,871
- Oh, Skyler.
- I know, right?

15
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,511
Well, actually, they were my idea.
You are all welcome.

16
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,558
- You are the devil.
- Oh, my gosh.

17
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,835
Hey, buddy.
Ready for a cold one?

18
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,480
No, no.

19
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,073
Not feeling 100 percent.
Oh, I hope it's not something you ate.

20
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,953
No, no. I just--

21
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,157
We have Pepto,
Uncle Hank.

22
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,919
Yeah.

23
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,919
Uh, no, I'm good, I, uh--
I think we need to shove off.

24
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,237
Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah.
Oh. Okay.

25
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,959
Sorry, Skyler, I hate to leave--

26
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,316
No, no. Don't worry
about it. I have help.

27
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,358
And by that, she means me.
Ha, ha.

28
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,080
- That is correct.
- Holly can help.

29
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,550
- Let's go send them on their way.
- Yeah.

30
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,558
Let's say goodbye
to auntie and uncle.

31
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,830
Been too long.

32
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,435
Say, "Bye, auntie."
Bye, sweetie, bye-bye.

33
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,712
You know, it's been about 100 years
since we've been bowling.

34
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,554
- Then how about Thursday?
- Oh, that sounds great.

35
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,393
Thank you for having us.

36
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,434
Absolutely. Take care of him.
Hey. You okay to drive?

37
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah.

38
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,072
All right, well, feel better.

39
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,157
Say, "Bye, Uncle Hank.
Bye-bye."

40
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,029
"Bye, Uncle Hank.
Bye, Aunt Marie."

41
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,079
All right, let's get started on
those dishes. Come on.

42
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,276
You.
You.

43
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,794
No, you.
You.

44
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,475
Washing, okay?
I'll dry. You wash.

45
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,313
You're a good washer.
Hello, Carol.

46
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,949
Oh, hi, Walt.

47
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,640
Europe.

48
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,440
I can't believe it. Were you
there when she said that?

49
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,074
Yeah.

50
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,232
You okay? Your stomach okay?

51
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Okay.

52
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,073
God, Jesus, Europe.

53
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,840
I just--

54
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,152
And, you know, where they were
three or four months ago.

55
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,631
She was talking about it
like it was a second honeymoon.

56
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,514
We need to go to Europe. We could go.
Yeah.

57
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,149
Have it be like a business trip,
you know?

58
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,554
It could, um, be Italy.
To Lake Como...

59
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,509
Hank? Hank?

60
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,275
Hank? You okay?

61
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,753
Hank!

62
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,796
Oh, my God. Hank?

63
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,997
Hank? Hank?

64
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,352
Oh, my God. Hank?

65
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,439
No. Are you okay?
I'm good.

66
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,672
Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance!

67
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,509
Okay. You okay?

68
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,040
Just take a breath.
Yeah.

69
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,078
Oh, God, sweetie.

70
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,749
- An accident. It happens.
- I'll make the appointment.

71
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,276
All you have to do is show up.
For what?

72
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,558
Three hours in the emergency room,
all for nothing.

73
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,672
All they did was rule out
a heart attack.

74
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,116
What if it happens again?
It won't happen again.

75
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,590
How can you know that?
You can't say what it was.

76
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,789
Marie, baby. I'm okay. I'm fine, trust me.
Discussion over.

77
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,916
And do not tell Skyler.
What? Why?

78
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,594
Just don't.

79
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,756
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about. Hank?

80
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,790
Luis.

81
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,229
Enrique. Ooh.

82
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,115
Hi.

83
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,029
Hi.

84
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,476
Okay.

85
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,197
Here you go. There's complimentary
coffee inside. Have an A-1 day.

86
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,670
Air fresheners are high-margin, right?

87
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,399
At 30 cents wholesale?
Yeah.

88
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,553
Right. So I'm thinking
we reorganize the display.

89
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,916
Separate the food scents
from the nature scents.

90
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,597
I mean, does bubble gum belong
anywhere near ocean spray? No.

91
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,474
And pine is still
our biggest seller, right?

92
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,835
So maybe we move that over to the cash
register, by the 5-hour Energy drink.

93
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,720
Sure. That'd be fine.
Yeah, yeah.

94
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,474
Come here.

95
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,996
Speaking of the business,

96
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,436
the story comes first.

97
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,911
The story is is that we are car
wash owners, pure and simple.

98
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,869
But if our story is that
the car wash is successful,

99
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,159
then what do successful
car wash owners do?

100
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,320
They buy more car washes.

101
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,074
Listen.

102
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,550
Skyler, you'll be laundering
that money for years.

103
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,513
Decades.

104
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,480
Wouldn't two be better than one?

105
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,115
Well, there's Gentle Hands over by Kirtland.
I do love that location.

106
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,074
I'll think about it.

107
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,069
Yeah. Right, right.
To be continued.

108
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,274
Okay.

109
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,473
Good morning.
Welcome to A-1.

110
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,279
Just the regular, please.

111
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,194
Well, we're having a special
on hand wax, 21.99

112
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,194
if you're interested
in getting rid of those water spots.

113
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,953
Just the regular is fine.

114
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,875
Okay. Well, there's complimentary
coffee inside while you're waiting.

115
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,350
Have an A-1 day.

116
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,394
Please give this to your car wash
professional, and have an A-1 day.

117
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,759
Sixty-eight percent.
And falling.

118
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,957
Good morning.
May I have your ticket, please?

119
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,592
I knew there would be a drop
in quality, but 68 percent?

120
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,832
This is not what I agreed to.

121
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,830
I left a viable operation.
The rest was up to you.

122
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,235
May I have your ticket, please?

123
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,676
I'm only asking for a few days,

124
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,309
a week at most.
Call it a tutorial.

125
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,472
That's the standard wash.

126
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,840
Fix this. Get the ship back on course.
We'll make it worth your while.

127
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,275
That'll be 14.95, please.

128
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,680
Listen, this is a complicated situation.
There are a lot of moving parts.

129
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,152
None of which are my concern.

130
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,994
You're putting me in a box here.

131
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,356
You know what could happen.

132
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,352
Again, none of my concern.

133
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,991
There's your change, and if you'll hand
this to your car wash professional...

134
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,992
And have an A-1 day.

135
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,240
Listen--
It'll only be a few more minutes.

136
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,875
There's some complimentary
coffee, if you like.

137
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,474
What's up?

138
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,994
Just wondering
who washes a rental car.

139
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,277
Walt, who was that?

140
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,359
She's a former business associate

141
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,557
who wants me to go back.

142
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,278
And I won't.

143
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,471
Enrique, this one's finished.

144
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,432
Get out of here.

145
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,636
Now.

146
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,435
Excuse me?

147
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,916
Never come back here.

148
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,400
Do you understand me?

149
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,232
I--
Go.

150
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,756
Hey.
Hey.

151
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,194
Oh, thanks.

152
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,318
You going in today?

153
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,834
Uh, no. No, no.

154
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,118
Good. You know, stay out of there
till you're sure you're better.

155
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,754
Yeah.
Stay home, rest,

156
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,718
don't even think about work.
Okay.

157
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,395
All right? I'll see you later.
All right.

158
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,234
Morning, Mrs. Schrader.
Hey, guys. What's going on?

159
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,193
Dropping these off.
Where'd you like them?

160
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,671
Bring them around to the garage, guys.
I got it.

161
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,513
Have a good day.

162
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,239
You too.

163
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,678
Boss, Janice said to tell you a few
of them might not have indexes.

164
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,911
We could give you a hand
sorting through them.

165
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,719
No, I got it, thanks.

166
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,600
All right.

167
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,077
- Well, see you, boss.
- Okay.

168
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,353
Okay, uh...

169
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,156
Dude, you are tripping. I'm not dead.

170
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,319
I'm on the starship <i>Enterprise,</i>
macking on Yeoman Rand

171
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,997
while the Andorian with the disruptor
is back on Talos IV, or whatever.

172
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,436
What do you think
all those sparkles and shit are?

173
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,478
Transporters
are breaking you apart, man.

174
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,997
Down to your molecules and bones.
They're making a copy.

175
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,712
That dude who comes out on the other
side? He's not you. He's a color Xerox.

176
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,233
So you're telling me every time Kirk went
into the transporter he was killing himself?

177
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,956
So over the whole series,
there's, like, 147 Kirks?

178
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,957
At least. Dude, why do you think
McCoy never likes to beam nowhere?

179
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,439
Because he's a doctor, bitch.
Look it up. It's science.

180
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,399
I ever tell you about
my <i>Star Trek</i> script?

181
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,076
<i>Star Trek</i> script?
Yeah. I gotta write it down, is all.

182
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,719
The <i>Enterprise</i>
is five parsecs out of Rigel XII.

183
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,395
Nothing's going on.
Neutral zone is quiet.

184
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,634
The crew is bored,
so they put on a pie-eating contest.

185
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,634
The whole crew's in the galley.
They're eating tulaberry pies.

186
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,599
Tulaberry?
Tulaberries, from Gamma Quadrant, yo.

187
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,440
That's <i>Voyager,</i> dude.
Okay, blueberries, then.

188
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,592
They're eating blueberry pies
Better.

189
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,276
-as fast as the replicator
can churn them out:

190
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,753
Finally it's down to just three:
Kirk, Spock and Chekov.

191
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,355
Okay, Spock always wins
these things.

192
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,678
How is Spock gonna beat Kirk, yo?
Spock's like a toothbrush.

193
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,553
Look at Kirk. He's got room to spare.

194
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,277
Spock has total Vulcan control over his digestion.
You wanna hear this or not?

195
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,319
Yeah. Yeah, go.
Okay. Finally, Kirk,

196
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,200
he can't take it anymore.
He yorks.

197
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,114
Now it's just down
to Chekov and Spock.

198
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,912
But Chekov, you see, he's got a whole
fat stack of quatloos riding on this

199
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,834
and he has figured out a way to win.

200
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,040
He's got Scotty back in the Transporter
Room locked in on Chekov's stomach.

201
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,358
Every time Chekov eats a pie,
Scotty beams it right out of him.

202
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,075
Where's he sending them? The toilet?
Space.

203
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,119
Oh!
There's blueberries just floating out there,

204
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,158
frozen, because it's in space.

205
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,994
And Chekov is just
shoveling them into his mouth

206
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,637
and Spock's like, "I can't believe
this Russian is defeating me."

207
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,190
Meanwhile,
Scotty's in the Transporter Room

208
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,632
fiddling with levers
when Lieutenant Uhura comes in.

209
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,591
She's got, you know, her big pointies,
and Scotty's fingers are all sweaty.

210
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,592
No.
Chekov screams.

211
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,355
He sprays blood out of his mouth.

212
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,479
Scotty beamed his guts
into space.

213
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,716
No way!

214
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,912
Hey, man, where you going?
You're missing the best part.

215
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,715
Just fill this out, bring it back to me.

216
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,476
Yo.

217
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,274
Yo!

218
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,239
You know you can't
smoke that up in here.

219
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,595
Yeah, Jesse Pinkman's
out here smoking pot.

220
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,797
Give me a break, man.

221
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,314
Pinkman. He'll see you now.

222
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,274
Woody Harrelson, live and in person.
Pull up a bong and take a seat.

223
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,638
Hey, I'm kidding about the bong.
Don't be doing that.

224
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,077
Uh, sorry to keep you on ice out there, kid.
If I'd known it was you...

225
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,994
Well, that Francesca,
I've warned her before.

226
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,392
One more time
and it's back to the DMV.

227
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,918
So, uh,
are we on our own today?

228
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,836
Barn door open.

229
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,959
Barn door?

230
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,350
Oh.

231
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,193
So how is the maestro? Things
have been quiet on this end.

232
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,920
I haven't seen him.

233
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,511
Just as well, probably.

234
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,354
That whole thing in the jails.
I mean,

235
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,632
when they start to whack lawyers,
that's when I draw the line.

236
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,436
This goes to Kaylee Ehrmantraut

237
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,153
and that goes to
Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sharp.

238
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,229
315 East Pueblo.
It's up in White Horse.

239
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,679
It's 2 and a half million each.
Total of 5.

240
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,433
Mr. and Mrs. who?

241
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,876
Drew Sharp's parents.

242
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,635
Drew Sharp?
Uh, that's the kid on TV?

243
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,474
The missing--?
So but why would you--?

244
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,720
Scratch that. Heh. I don't know,
and I don't wanna know. Uh...

245
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,197
The thing is, what those folks want is
to know what happened to their boy.

246
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,479
A sack full of cash on their doorstep?
That's just gonna raise more questions.

247
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,952
Kaylee Ehrmantraut?
That's Mike's granddaughter?

248
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,792
So this is Mike's money?
It's mine.

249
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,200
It's your money. Okay. And you're
giving it to Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

250
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,238
It's what Mike wanted.

251
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,399
So you and Mike, uh,
you've been in touch?

252
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,479
So we're just talking about charity?

253
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,314
Yeah.

254
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,757
Okay, look, you know, um, shelling out
money to the ex and her little boy,

255
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,915
I kind of get it. I mean, kind of. But
this, ha, ha, this is a bridge too far.

256
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,034
I'm sorry to say, kid, but you're still
gonna be two miracles short of sainthood.

257
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,034
Brass tacks.
Okay, my job is to advise,

258
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,752
and my advice is,
come on, already.

259
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,196
Mike left one step ahead
of the boys in blue.

260
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,511
You better believe
his family's on the radar.

261
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,554
A couple million bucks shows up,
they're gonna snatch it.

262
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,036
The feds have already taken
Kaylee's money twice.

263
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,591
What, are you going for a hat trick?
I'll freaking do it myself, Saul.

264
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,752
No, no, no!
I was just thinking out loud.

265
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,719
Enough bullshit, Saul.
Are you gonna do this or not?

266
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,072
Yes, yes. Absolutely. I live to serve.

267
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,200
And, kid, you might wanna think about
cleaning up a little, getting some rest.

268
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,000
You've looked better.
Just get it done.

269
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,797
You know who this is?
Don't hang up on me.

270
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,200
Yeah, there's a problem.

271
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,159
There's 5 million of them
here in my office.

272
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,070
No, no, don't. Just hold on to it.

273
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,950
Yes.

274
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,600
Ye--

275
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,280
Yes.

276
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,513
Calm down.

277
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,473
I'll handle it.

278
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,397
Déjà vu, huh?

279
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,079
Jesus.

280
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,519
All right, look,

281
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,239
you wanna talk me
through this?

282
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,637
What you were thinking?

283
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,231
What you asked Saul to do.
I mean, come on.

284
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,517
It's just nonsensical.

285
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,599
Do you--?

286
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,392
Do you have any explanation
at all?

287
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,439
Blood money.
What?

288
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,998
It's like you said.

289
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,876
It's blood money.

290
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,480
I sa--?

291
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,990
Jesus. Okay, yes, all right.
I said that.

292
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,920
I did.

293
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,231
But it was in the heat of the moment.
I was trying to win an argument.

294
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,915
All right? And I was wrong.

295
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,117
This is your money.

296
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,636
Come on, you've earned it.

297
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,473
Drew Sharp.

298
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,472
That is a terrible memory,
no doubt about it.

299
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,353
But, son,

300
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,469
you need to stop focusing
on the darkness behind you.

301
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,236
The past is the past.

302
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,832
Look, nothing can change
what we've done.

303
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,956
But now that's over.

304
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,633
You're out.

305
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,593
And so am I.

306
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,559
That's right. I'm done.

307
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,278
I've been out for about a month.

308
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,156
But there is nothing left
for us to do except to try

309
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,079
to live...

310
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,199
ordinary, decent lives.

311
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,234
Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

312
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,840
She needs someone
looking after her.

313
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,039
Mike is perfectly capable of looking
after his own granddaughter.

314
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,558
I don't think so.

315
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,355
I don't think he is capable.

316
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,111
I don't think he's coming back.

317
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,436
What--?
What are you saying?

318
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,955
You doing what you did,

319
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,994
offing Mike's guys?

320
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,750
If he was out there, you'd have to look over
your shoulder for the rest of your life.

321
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,836
And that's not how you do things.
So I think he's dead,

322
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,591
and I think you know that.

323
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,877
I don't know that.

324
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,078
I don't.

325
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,353
Listen to me.

326
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,273
I did not kill Mike.

327
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,840
The last time that I saw him, he had
his bag, the one that I brought him.

328
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,117
And he got into his car,
and he drove away.

329
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,318
And for all I know,
he's alive and well.

330
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,349
And if...

331
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,595
If he does come back and he doesn't
understand why I had to do what I did...

332
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,679
well, then, that's on me.

333
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,839
Jesse?

334
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,596
I need you to believe this.

335
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,633
It's not true. It's just not.

336
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,633
So he's out there?

337
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,149
He's okay?

338
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,800
Yes.

339
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,075
Mike is fine,
wherever he is.

340
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,352
We both know
that he can take care of himself.

341
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,955
And he's certainly capable
to provide for his own family. Okay?

342
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,753
Jesse.

343
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,520
I need you to believe me.

344
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,040
Yeah.

345
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,278
Like you said.

346
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,993
He's alive.

347
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,160
Yeah.

348
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,039
Mike's alive.

349
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,998
Absolutely.

350
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,238
You've got to have a counselor.
Are they bringing in someone new?

351
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,353
I don't know.
Um, maybe she'll be back.

352
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,639
What if she's not? What are you supposed to do?
What's Louis gonna do?

353
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,359
He's not worried.

354
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,309
Oh, yeah, sure. What's there to worry about?
It's only college, right?

355
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,834
Right.

356
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,560
College.
Nothing more important.

357
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,838
Oh, you know,
Uncle Hank's still not feeling well,

358
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,798
so bowling's off tomorrow night.

359
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,440
- Really?
- Really.

360
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
So you're spared
a night out with the family.

361
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,832
You do not have to look
so happy about it.

362
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,878
I'll be right back.

363
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,800
Um...

364
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,430
So if bowling's off,

365
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,397
can I get a late curfew?

366
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,476
Are you gonna
turn off the light?

367
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,036
Have you seen
<i>Leaves of Grass?</i>

368
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,555
Hm?

369
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,639
My book.

370
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,951
Walt Whitman.
Dark green hardcover.

371
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,516
I didn't even know
we had that.

372
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,350
Hm.

373
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,596
You don't think Junior...?

374
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,792
You're kidding, right?

375
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,474
Well,

376
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,879
it'll show up.

377
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,990
What's wrong with Hank?
Mm...

378
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,519
It's a stomach bug, sounds like.

379
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,116
He hasn't been to work all week.

380
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,993
Well, good night.

381
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,080
Night.

382
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,595
Mister.
Can you help me out?

383
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,592
Spare some change?

384
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,360
Hey.

385
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,910
Come back.

386
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,313
Yeah. You. Come here,
I got something for you.

387
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,359
Here.

388
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,074
Take it.

389
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,910
Go ahead.

390
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,159
Just take it.

391
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,069
Take it.

392
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,160
Yeah.

393
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,471
Anything you want us
to tell Steve Gomez?

394
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,199
Says he's worried about you.

395
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,750
Yeah. Tell him I already
got two grandmas.

396
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,079
Listen, tell everybody
more work and less worry.

397
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,669
Guess we better hit it.
Yeah.

398
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,880
Yeah.

399
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,998
- Hey, guys.
- Walt.

400
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,560
How are you?
Good to see you.

401
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,120
How you doing?

402
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,237
Well, you know,
I can't complain. Heh, heh.

403
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,796
How's your son's arm?
I was thinking about that.

404
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,792
Back to 100 percent. Going to district.

405
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,474
Gonna be exciting.
This Saturday?

406
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,951
This Saturday morning.
I think first pitch is at 10 a.m.

407
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,949
Yeah, yeah. It'll be fun.
Should be a big crowd.

408
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,790
Guys, you're still on the clock here!
Let's go.

409
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,519
- See you, Walt.
- See you, Artie.

410
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,399
All right, Scott.
Be well.

411
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,277
They're good guys, huh?
Yeah, they're good guys.

412
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,114
Well, it's good to see you up and about.
Yeah.

413
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,115
How are you feeling?
Well, you know. I've been better, but...

414
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,434
Yeah.
Have you--?

415
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,518
Did you get to see a doctor?
I mean,

416
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,275
when one of these things
lasts more than three days,

417
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,918
you really should get that checked.
Yeah, no, I did, and I'm fine.

418
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,719
I'm, what they say,
on the upswing, you know?

419
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,520
Mm. Good. Good to hear.
Yeah.

420
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,110
When I heard you weren't
going in to work, I-- Well...

421
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,879
Looks like you have the work
coming to you.

422
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,390
Perks of being the boss,
huh?

423
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,796
Eh, you know...

424
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,319
How's, uh--?

425
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,470
How's things at the car wash?

426
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,313
Good.
Yeah?

427
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,796
Yeah, really good.

428
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,634
Hey, did you have
any of that potato salad?

429
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,752
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe.
Yeah, I mean, no one else got sick,

430
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,196
so I probably
shouldn't worry about it.

431
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,718
Well, Skyler will be very happy
to hear that you're feeling better.

432
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,470
Which reminds me,
I better get back to it.

433
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,516
If there's anything I can do...

434
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,800
Feel better.

435
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,914
You know...

436
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,918
you're gonna laugh,
but I have to ask you about this.

437
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,237
Believe it or not,
I found this on my car.

438
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,031
I mean, it looks just like the GPS tracker
that we used on Gus Fring, doesn't it?

439
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,719
Back when we were tracking him,
just the two of us.

440
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,559
You wouldn't know anything
about this, would you, Hank?

441
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,399
You okay?

442
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,480
I gotta say, I don't like the way
you're looking at me right now.

443
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,913
It was you.

444
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,311
All along, it was you!

445
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,196
You son of a bitch.

446
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,750
You drove into traffic
to keep me from that laundry.

447
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,434
Calm down.

448
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,915
That call I got, telling me Marie
was in the hospital,

449
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,038
that wasn't Pinkman.

450
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,919
You had my cell number.

451
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,272
You killed 10 witnesses
to save your sorry ass.

452
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,154
Listen to me.
You bombed a nursing home.

453
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,791
Heisenberg. Heisenberg.

454
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,270
You lying,
two-faced sack of shit.

455
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,874
Hank.

456
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,119
Look, I don't know where this is
coming from, Hank, but just--

457
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,152
I swear to Christ,

458
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,870
I will put you under the jail.
Take a breath, okay? Listen to yourself.

459
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,232
These wild accusations, they could
destroy our family. And for what?

460
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,750
You don't give a shit
about family!

461
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,160
Hank, my cancer is back.

462
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,200
Good.

463
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,670
Rot, you son of a bitch.

464
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,877
I'm sorry you feel that way.

465
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,430
I wanna beat this thing, I do.

466
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,957
I'm back on chemo,
and I am fighting like hell.

467
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:53,117
But the truth is, in six months, you
won't have someone to prosecute.

468
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,679
But even--

469
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,239
Even if somehow you were
able to convince anyone

470
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,239
that I was capable
of doing these things,

471
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,472
you and I both know I would
never see the inside of a jail cell.

472
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,957
I'm a dying man

473
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,153
who runs a car wash.

474
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,071
My right hand to God,
that is all that I am.

475
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,399
What's the point?

476
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,995
Have Skyler bring the kids here.

477
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,832
And then we'll talk.

478
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,509
That is not going to happen.

479
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,671
I don't know who you are.

480
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,754
I don't even know who I'm talking to.

481
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,599
If that's true...

482
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,436
if you don't know who I am...

483
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,630
then maybe your best course...

484
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,834
would be to tread lightly.
