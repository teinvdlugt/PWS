8
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:08,234
In here.

9
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:38,389
Hey! Hey! Hey! What about him?

10
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,350
What about him?

11
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,161
Hey. Someone.

12
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,707
Help. Ugh. Assistance.

13
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,794
This man needs help.

14
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,046
This man pays my salary.

15
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,493
Forty-point-two-three pounds.

16
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,210
Are they back yet?

17
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,712
Have you heard from anyone?

18
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,591
If Pinkman is gone,

19
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,470
I'm done. Do you understand?
I quit.

20
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,941
I just told you, 40.23 pounds.

21
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:19,073
Forty-point-two-one.

22
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:46,058
My brother-in-law, he keeps
talking about driving out
to the factory farm.

23
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,687
And I have-- l have stalled him
as long as I possibly can.

24
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,814
It's really at the point now

25
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,067
where he's gonna find someone else
to take him there.

26
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,487
So I don't know
if it's been made presentable yet.

27
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,617
But l should be the one
to take him out there, right?

28
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,374
Can you just run it up
the chain of command then?

29
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,515
Anything suspicious?

30
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,728
Still no, Walt. Heh.

31
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,401
Well, then should we go?

32
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,615
Got some place to be?
Because it's, like, the third time
you asked me that.

33
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:46,827
No, I'm just curious
what the next move is.

34
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,206
Our next three moves
is sitting here and waiting.

35
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,624
This here's the job, buddy.

36
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:56,587
Ain't all supermodels
and speedboats, you know.

37
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,345
Any, uh, cartel news
these days?

38
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:09,183
Seems like l'm always reading
something or other in the paper.

39
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,145
Yeah, well,
not a lot happening stateside.

40
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,482
Hearing rumblings
about some big play down south.

41
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,193
Lots of bodies, apparently. Tsk.

42
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,029
You know, even by cartel standards.

43
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,951
We'll know more
when the buzzards leave the bones.

44
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,625
So when we gonna talk
about your face?

45
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,424
I don't wanna get into it, okay?
No, it's not okay.

46
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,635
My brother-in-law shows up
looking like Macho Camacho,

47
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,179
and he thinks
we're not gonna discuss it?

48
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,682
If you're in over your head
on something,

49
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,893
don't you think I might be
the guy to come to?

50
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,316
You know, one of my old,
uh, buddies from Glynco
had a gambling problem,

51
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:05,197
except his thing was scratch cards
instead of blackjack. Heh.

52
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:10,953
Dumb Okie bastard
had his car repo'd playing
scratch-and-wins. Heh-heh.

53
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:16,459
He's fine now, you know.
He got help and all.

54
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:22,339
But l know he got on a ride
that was rough to get off of.

55
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,468
I'm just saying l'm here, you know.

56
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,887
If you want to talk about it.

57
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:36,520
I don't want to talk about it,
to you or to anyone else.

58
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,398
I'm done explaining myself.

59
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,554
Hey, uh... Yo, you think
he needs more blood?

60
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,723
It's in the refrigerator.

61
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,519
What, you--? You want me to, uh...?

62
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,201
A-negative, yes?

63
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:34,870
Your blood type?

64
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,957
Um... I don't know, maybe.

65
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,087
A-negative, 25 years old,

66
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,924
seventy kilo, 1 80 centimeters.

67
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:51,595
You smoke, you drink,
you, uh, puff, puff, puff.

68
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:52,930
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

69
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,516
But no disease, no condition.

70
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,645
No complication
other than an allergy to...

71
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,105
Oh, wait, don't say.

72
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,691
Erythromycin.

73
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:07,945
But l have cefazolin here,
so no problem.

74
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,114
How do you know all that?

75
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,997
Jesus.

76
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,499
He thought of everything.

77
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,424
O-negative.

78
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,176
That's what he needs.

79
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,309
It's time to go.

80
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,102
What about Mike?

81
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:45,441
With this injury? No travel.
At least a week.

82
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,612
I'll send for him.

83
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,206
You need protection, Gustavo?

84
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,295
I wouldn't have guessed.

85
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,222
Water and rest.

86
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,296
What happened to the plane?

87
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,884
There are many
good ways south.

88
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,096
But, unfortunately,
only one way north.

89
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,976
Six miles to Texas.

90
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,604
I've got a man there
who'll drive us
the rest of the way.

91
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,318
I kind of liked the plane.

92
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,658
So you gonna make it?
Six miles is pretty far.

93
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,702
I'll make it.

94
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,374
You did well down here.

95
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,876
And you also proved a point.

96
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:33,340
I think you can run the lab
by yourself now.

97
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,175
Don't you?

98
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,184
Let Mr. White go.

99
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,939
Pay him off or fire him.

100
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,899
Don't kill him.

101
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,781
You know that won't work.
Then you got a problem.

102
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,054
Hi. We're home.

103
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,683
Are you doing your homework?

104
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,185
Yeah.

105
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:30,856
Mm-hm. Well, dinner is in about 30.

106
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,862
Hey, sorry to call you at home,

107
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,907
but I think maybe
you're not getting my messages.

108
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,368
That or you just
don't feel like talking to me.

109
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:47,331
Anyway, why l've been calling
is because that thing we discussed?

110
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,500
Well, I've been thinking,

111
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:54,671
and, uh, I decided l can't do it.
That's probably not
what you wanted to hear.

112
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,049
But hopefully you'll understand,

113
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,344
and if you want to talk
more about it, that's fine.

114
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,763
So call me. l'm around.

115
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,489
Hey. Come on in.
Hi.

116
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:30,707
Ahem. First, l wanna tell you
that I get it.

117
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:36,380
From what you've told me,
this situation with Walt's
gambling sounds...

118
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,799
intense.

119
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,761
Yeah, it definitely was.

120
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,014
And continues to be.

121
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:53,689
So I would greatly appreciate it
if you would just...

122
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,649
help me out here.

123
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:59,027
Well, I've thought
long and hard
about this...

124
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,700
and, uh, here's
what I want to do.
Ahem.

125
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,290
So is, uh, Walt gonna be okay?

126
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,167
Are you in contact with him?

127
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,252
Um, he's fine.

128
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,921
Good. That's good.

129
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,385
He doesn't know about you offering--?
No. Absolutely not.

130
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,347
And I mean to keep it
that way, so...

131
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:34,480
Six hundred and seventeen
thousand dollars written out to me.

132
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:39,193
Uh... What is this?

133
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,487
I can't take your money.
Oh?

134
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,531
And why is that?
Because, at the end of the day,

135
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:49,661
paying my debt
with illicit gambling winnings, uh...

136
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,706
I don't know, it feels wrong.

137
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,708
"lt feels wrong"?

138
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,668
To me it does.
Uh-huh.

139
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:01,173
I'm not judging you or Walt.
I'm just saying
I feel uncomfortable with it.

140
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,135
Well, um, Ted,
the whole reason
we're in this mess

141
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,263
is because you had me
cooking your books.

142
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:13,227
So when did wrong suddenly
become a problem for you?

143
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,896
Now, hold on,
that was a one-time measure

144
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,607
in an honest attempt
to protect my employees

145
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,359
and save my dad's company.

146
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:24,696
It might've been a mistake,
but that's no reason
to go out and make another.

147
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,534
No, Ted, this is the big mistake,
right here.

148
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:34,498
You owe the federal government
$61 7,000. If you do not pay them,

149
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,168
they will come after you
and then they will come after me.

150
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:43,382
And if they audit my business,
find out that Walt and l paid for it

151
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,511
with close to a million dollars
in untaxed gambling winnings,

152
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,224
we will go to prison, where you will
already be. Do you understand?

153
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:56,520
I understand you're upset, but I think
you're overstating things too.

154
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,063
No one's going to prison.

155
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,732
Oh, my God.
How are you not following me here?

156
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,071
Okay, fine,
let's say l take your advice.

157
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,824
I pay the IRS. Then what?

158
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,326
Then you don't owe them.

159
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,621
Okay, but l still owe
the bank, Skyler.

160
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,625
I'm still going to go bankrupt
and lose my business
and my home.

161
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,503
I still have to pull my girls
out of school.

162
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:26,508
Just because I pay some
stupid fine doesn't make
my life any less ruined.

163
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:33,432
So if l'm understanding you
correctly,

164
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,144
you're saying you can't take
the money I gave you...

165
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,939
but you can take a larger amount.

166
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,817
No. I'm just saying,

167
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,154
as much as l appreciate the gesture,

168
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,365
the money you gave me
doesn't really change anything.

169
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,495
Because it's not enough?
No, no, don't twist my words.

170
00:15:55,663 --> 00:16:00,292
This isn't about amounts,
this is about me doing the right thing.

171
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,757
Ted, are you blackmailing me?
What? No. Blackmailing?

172
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,717
God.

173
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,931
I feel I'm not explaining things right.
I think you're explaining it fine.

174
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:26,610
I notice that, uh, this is for less
than what I gave you, by the way.

175
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,280
That's the Mercedes. I leased it before
I knew where the money came from.

176
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,824
Mm. Now that you know,
you will be returning it.

177
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,244
The leases are ironclad,
so I have to see what's possible,

178
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,914
but, yeah, I'm gonna do my best.

179
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,667
And I will pay you back
as soon as I can.

180
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:48,006
I don't want you to pay me, Ted.
I want you to pay them.

181
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,097
Try it again.

182
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,807
Write a new check.

183
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,142
Skyler.
Same amount.

184
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,229
This time, made payable--
What happened to us?

185
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:06,400
Make it payable
to the Internal Revenue Service.

186
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,905
I can't.
You have to.

187
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:16,576
Actually, no I don't.
Write it.

188
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,181
Saul Goodman, please.

189
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,935
Tell him it's important.

190
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,146
Yeah.

191
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,443
What have I done?

192
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,207
Hello, Hector.

193
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,830
All of them, Hector.

194
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,541
Don Eladio.

195
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,169
Don Paco. Cesar.

196
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,088
Renaldo. Artuno.

197
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,341
Cisco and Luis.

198
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,718
Escalada.

199
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,680
All dead.

200
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,726
As is your grandson, Joaquin.

201
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,901
Do you know who killed Joaquin?

202
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,240
Would you like to see?

203
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,123
This young man.

204
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,918
Do you remember him?

205
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:35,298
That young man
shot Joaquin to death...

206
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,593
while I made my escape.

207
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,225
I believe you have met him before.

208
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,776
It was just you and Joaquin.

209
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,071
He was the only family you had left.

210
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:05,287
Now the Salamanca name
dies with you.

211
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,043
Will you look at me now?

212
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,756
Look at me, Hector.

213
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,512
Look at me.

214
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,620
I really appreciate you doing this.

215
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,415
You guys must have your hands filled
with the car wash and all.

216
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,376
No, no. No worries.

217
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,795
Happy to do it.

218
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:42,425
Besides, it gives me a chance
to see how you work a case. Ha-ha.

219
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,886
It's, uh, interesting.
Yeah.

220
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,263
Like watching
weeds grow, huh? Heh.

221
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,976
Ah, this job can be boring as hell.

222
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,227
Until it's not.

223
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,900
So, um...

224
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,820
Any more news on that thing
in Mexico?

225
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:07,867
No, same old, same old.
Bunch of animals clawing
each other's eyes out over turf.

226
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:12,288
So you think all the victims
were cartel members?

227
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:16,292
Not in the loop enough to know.
Take a right on this street, will you?

228
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,585
Right?

229
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,339
But, uh, we're going
to the chicken farm,
that's straight ahead.

230
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,800
No, we're taking a little detour.

231
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,303
All right.

232
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:32,308
Yeah, there's this, uh,
industrial laundry
I wanna check out.

233
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,520
It's not far.
Just, yeah, turn right here.

234
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,861
What, uh--?
What laundry? What about it?

235
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,072
It's owned by this company,
this Madrigal Electromotive.

236
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,118
It's this big German conglomerate
right into everything.

237
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:55,874
It turns out it's the same company
that owns Fring's chicken joints.

238
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:04,382
Sounds like a real shot
in the dark there.

239
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,551
I mean, you said it yourself.

240
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,595
If this Madrigal, is it?

241
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:11,139
If this is such a big conglomerate,

242
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:15,560
then, you know, they must own
all kinds of businesses.

243
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:21,066
No, it just--
It just sounds kind of thin.

244
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,652
Well, look at you.
You lose your hair,
go on a couple stakeouts,

245
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,363
all of a sudden you're,
what, Kojak? He-he-he.

246
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,865
I'm just saying.

247
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:35,246
Now, the chicken farm, however,
boy, that place seems ripe

248
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:39,084
for some kind
of clandestine activities.

249
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,087
I just don't want us to miss anything,
you know?

250
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,672
You wanna talk about
clandestine activities?

251
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,509
Madrigal Electromotive
also owns a subsidiary

252
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,805
that manufactures this
state-of-the-art air-filtration system.

253
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,810
And none other than
Gale Boetticher took delivery
of one of these systems.

254
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,938
A chemist
who was in possession
of hand-drawn plans

255
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:05,068
for a meth super-lab and was visited
by none other than Gus Fring

256
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:08,071
just days before he was capped
in the face, okay?

257
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,448
This shit is starting to feel like--

258
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,951
Like Three Days Of The Condor,
you know?

259
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:18,706
Anyway, an industrial laundry
would be one hell of a place
to hide a meth lab.

260
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,251
There it is right up there.
Just turn in there.

261
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,715
Walt, slow down.
You gotta turn in there, Walt.

262
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,594
What are you doing? You missed it.
Sorry.

263
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,931
It looked like a dirt road.
I thought you meant further up.

264
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,144
Just-- Just bang
a U-ie over here.

265
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,692
Whoa!

266
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,535
- Mm. Hits the spot.
- Thanks, guys.

267
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,455
Heh-heh. l said to Mom
"ice cream," but, um, she was like:

268
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,665
"lt tastes the same

269
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,376
and it's healthier."
So, heh, sorry.

270
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,919
I tried.

271
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,131
Frozen yogurt does taste the same.
Tastes exactly the same.

272
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,175
Wow. l feel, like,
sorry for your taste buds.

273
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:15,013
Heh-heh. Weigh in here, Uncle Hank.
Hey, it's free food. Ahem.

274
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:18,433
Free food always tastes good.
Free drinks even better.

275
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,101
Hey, hon.

276
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,271
Can you handle another visitor?

277
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,316
Ho-ho! Mr. Magoo. Yeah, sure.
- Hey, watch out.

278
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,444
- Don't run into any walls or anything.
Ha-ha. Okay.

279
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:32,864
Hey, Dad.

280
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,782
Hey, son.

281
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,951
So how you feeling, Hank?

282
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,954
It feels like one of those cones
they put on dogs,

283
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:44,876
so they don't lick their own balls.
Nice. Thank you. Stay classy.

284
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,713
Anyway, hanging in there.
Glad you stopped by.

285
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,008
Listen, I'm sorry about all this.

286
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,761
I mean, that guy
just came out of nowhere.

287
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,846
Yeah, actually, he didn't.

288
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,848
I saw him coming a mile away.

289
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,185
Hey, just mark it down
as a brain fart

290
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,605
and, uh, be thankful
no one got killed.

291
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:09,484
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
Your Hardy Boys routine is over.

292
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:12,070
No more asking him
to drive you on stakeouts.

293
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,697
It's too dangerous. You hear me?

294
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,699
I'll do it.
No, you won't.

295
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:20,245
No, Marie's right.
It was a bit short-sighted of me.

296
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,456
- That's why l, uh, caved.
- Caved?

297
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:27,335
Yeah, I broke down.
I, uh, ordered me a gimp-mobile.

298
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,381
I wish you would stop calling it that.

299
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,509
What do you mean?
Like a handi-van with a lift?

300
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:38,930
No, no, it's a regular Tahoe.
It's got hand controls. l ordered it.

301
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:43,434
Should be here in about a week.
I don't expect to be in it long,

302
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,855
but, uh, gotta get around
on my own. Stop being
such a damn burden to everyone.

303
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,944
Oh.

304
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:58,908
Oh. Sorry. Car wash business.

305
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,536
Hey, it's me. Can you talk?

306
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:02,996
I can listen.

307
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,290
Fair enough.
He doesn't own a gun,

308
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,250
at least not one
that he bought legally.

309
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:12,088
Nor does his home security system
have any panic-button arrangement.

310
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,509
So way I see it, we're good to go.
If this is still how
you want to handle it.

311
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,805
Like l said, l don't want anyone hurt.

312
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,142
All l want
is for him to write a check.

313
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,687
Yeah. It's gonna be fine.
I've got my A-team on it.

314
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:48,458
Can l help you?
Yeah, thanks.

315
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,793
What--? You just can't--

316
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,674
What's this about?
I'll tell you what this is about.

317
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:00,261
This is about you and me
doing our best to keep Huell happy.

318
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,639
Huell? Who's Huell?
This is Huell.

319
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:07,185
Huell, you happy?
Reasonably.

320
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,103
What would make you unhappy?

321
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,773
This motherfucker
not doing what he's told.

322
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:15,276
If you were unhappy,
Mr. Beneke wouldn't care for that?

323
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,945
I'm gonna say no.

324
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,616
Well, there you have it.
Let's go find your checkbook.
Ready?

325
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:25,244
Here we go. All right?
We're walking,
we're swinging our feet.

326
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,539
There you go. Very nice.
Beautiful place you have here.

327
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:34,796
This way. So the amount's
gonna be for $61 7,226--

328
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:38,466
Whoa. l don't have that kind of money.
Hold that thought.

329
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:42,804
Forgot to mention we know
exactly how much money
is in your account, okay?

330
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,682
Understand? You still want to say
that stuff from before? Maybe not.

331
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:53,689
So $61 7,226 and 31 cents,

332
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,693
made payable
to the Internal Revenue Service.

333
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,113
What?

334
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,782
Wait, this is, uh...?

335
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,827
Skyler? Skyler White sent you?
It doesn't matter.

336
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,371
For now, all you have to do
is worry about that.

337
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,456
My God, this is a misunderstanding.

338
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,251
Skyler is a dear friend of mine,
all right?

339
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,045
Let me call her. We'll, uh...

340
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:20,842
No, you're misunderstanding,
Mr. Beneke. Phone-call time is over.

341
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,053
Check-writing time.
Skyler would never do this to me.

342
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,763
Sit down and write!

343
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,684
There you go.

344
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:37,108
Six hundred seventeen thousand,
two hundred twenty-six dollars

345
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,943
and thirty-one...

346
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,112
Yeah, right.

347
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,575
You got it.

348
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:56,836
Huell, you happy?
Ha-ha. Huell's happy.

349
00:29:57,004 --> 00:30:01,007
All right. Everything else
has been filled out for you.

350
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:03,342
All's we need...

351
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,597
is a signature

352
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,140
right there.

353
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,230
Great.

354
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,857
Hard part is over.

355
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:21,611
Here's what happens next.
Huell is gonna hang here with you.

356
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,323
I'm gonna make sure I get this down
to UPS before 5:00.

357
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,700
Way back,
I'm gonna grab some sandwiches.

358
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:31,037
The three of us can hang out
and play cards or watch TV

359
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,748
for the next couple of days
until the check clears.

360
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,125
Painless, right?

361
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,003
Unless you don't have cable,

362
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,173
in which case it's gonna suck, so...

363
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:30,596
Does the laundry have to be dirty?

364
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,642
Nope.

365
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,146
Someone cooked here.

366
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,233
You've been out of commission
four days.

367
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:28,779
You think we're gonna shut down
the whole operation just for you?

368
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,699
Who cooked? Who was here?

369
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,210
I don't know how you're doing
the flips. Tell me.

370
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,629
Keep cool.

371
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:48,466
Oh. Oh, I'm gonna get you.
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

372
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,179
Jump.

373
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,477
You're pressing buttons,
and it makes you do magical stuff.

374
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,562
No.
Yes. Cheater.

375
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,564
Hey.
Who's winning?

376
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,609
I am.
Well-- Yeah. Look at you.

377
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,235
Look at--
Ooh. Yeah.

378
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:15,326
A hundred and one back flips, l did.
Oh, you. Hey, keep it going.

379
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,286
Hey, hey, hey.
Relax.

380
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,413
- Ooh. You're in trouble.
- Good luck.

381
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,540
Mama is in the house.

382
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,336
Jesse.

383
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:31,175
What do you want? l'm busy.
We need to talk.

384
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,470
I got nothing to say to you, man.

385
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,642
Jesse, please. I'm sorry.

386
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,895
Just one minute. That's all I ask.

387
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,064
Get the hell out of my house.

388
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,774
Come on. Come on.

389
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,110
Hey. Just give me one minute.

390
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,987
Let me just explain.
Okay.

391
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,531
Let me--
Shh! Shh!

392
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:57,993
All right. All right.
Okay, okay.
All right, I'm sorry.

393
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:02,081
I know that you have been
cooking without me.

394
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:05,167
That's right. So what?

395
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,796
So what?

396
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:12,842
Isn't it obvious to you
what Gus is planning?

397
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,886
He's going to use you
to replace me.

398
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,806
He doesn't think
you need me anymore.

399
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:24,562
Jesse. Jesse, if you agree

400
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,814
to replace me,

401
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,774
he will kill me.

402
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,321
You brought your brother-in-law
to our lab. What the hell
is wrong with you?

403
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,616
That's not my fault, Jesse.
Get off.

404
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:41,120
You've got to help me. Please.

405
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,957
The last time I asked for your help,
you said:

406
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:50,379
"l hope you end up buried in a barrel
in the Mexican desert."

407
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,523
You are done.

408
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,401
Fired.

409
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,863
Do not show your face
at the laundry again.

410
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,991
Stay away from Pinkman.

411
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,286
Do not go near him.

412
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,413
Ever.

413
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,416
Are you listening to me?

414
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,464
Or else you'll do what?

415
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,426
What did you say?

416
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:03,262
Stay away from Pinkman...

417
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,142
or else you'll do...

418
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,020
what?

419
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,355
Kill me?

420
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,485
If you could kill me...

421
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,532
I'd already be dead.

422
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,662
But you can't.

423
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,790
You can't kill me,

424
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:37,630
because Jesse wouldn't
cook for you if you did.

425
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,259
That's it, isn't it?

426
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:51,477
No matter how hard you try

427
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,812
to turn him against me,

428
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,315
to screw with his head,

429
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:59,485
so that he would hate my guts,

430
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:05,449
and he still won't let you do it.

431
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,119
For now.

432
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,288
But he'll come around.

433
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,251
In the meantime, there's the matter
of your brother-in-law.

434
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:21,507
He is a problem
you promised to resolve.

435
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:23,509
You have failed.

436
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:28,055
Now it's left to me to deal with him.

437
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,890
You can't--

438
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,810
If you try to interfere...

439
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,523
this becomes
a much simpler matter.

440
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:41,110
I will kill your wife.

441
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,529
I will kill your son.

442
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:48,158
I will kill your infant daughter.

443
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:41,670
Great. Perfect.
You know, this is just...

444
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,133
I told her you were my A-team.

445
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,218
It was an act of God.

446
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,805
Ain't no accounting
for no act of God.

447
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,891
Check is in the mail, at least.

448
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,726
"Hello, Mrs. White.

449
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,936
The good news is the IRS
has been paid off.

450
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,856
The bad news is..."
Ugh! Jesus!

451
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,109
Well, here goes nothing.

452
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,695
- Hey! Hey!
- Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

453
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,280
- What the--?
- Saul.

454
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,700
How did you hear?
What? Hear what?

455
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,579
Guys, go, go, go. Scram.

456
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,290
What the hell happened to you?
Saul. Saul.

457
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,292
This man that we spoke of before.

458
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,378
This person that you said
could disappear me.

459
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,005
Give me a new life.
Yeah.

460
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,174
Make sure I'm never found.
Yeah.

461
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,385
Yeah, I need him, Saul.

462
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,679
Gus is gonna murder
my whole family.

463
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,640
Christ.

464
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:37,476
I need this man now.

465
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,978
Saul. Now, Saul!
Yeah, yeah.

466
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,982
There's no coming back.
You're gonna get new Socials,
new identities.

467
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,152
You can't contact your friends
or relatives ever again.

468
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,405
All right. I understand.
How are you gonna sell this

469
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:54,159
to that wife of yours and your son?
I have got no choice.

470
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:57,412
You're wanted by scary individuals,
not to mention the law.

471
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,125
You're high-risk. You'll need
the deluxe service. lt'll cost you.

472
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,543
How much?

473
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,296
Last quote l got on the deluxe
was 125 grand.

474
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,007
But you got four people.
It'll be at least half a million.

475
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,593
He accepts cash only.
I've got the money.

476
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,095
Please!
Here.

477
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:14,680
Okay.

478
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,225
This is a vacuum cleaner
repair company.

479
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:21,895
Did you expect Haji's Quick-Vanish?
I don't even know his name.

480
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,022
You just call and leave a message.

481
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,359
You tell them
that you need a new dust filter

482
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,529
for a Hoover MaxExtract
Pressure Pro, Model 60.

483
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,240
I wrote it right on there.
He'll call you back.

484
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,368
Okay, fine. How long does it take
for him to arrange?

485
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,537
The guy works fast. That's the game.

486
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:42,499
You gotta have your family packed
and ready before you make the call.

487
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,086
He'll tell you where to meet,
he'll put you up in a safe house.

488
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,798
You gotta bring money.
He doesn't lift a finger
unless he's paid.

489
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,341
Okay.

490
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,094
Saul.
Can't say it's been a pleasure--

491
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,597
I need you to do
one more thing for me.

492
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,348
You need to call the DEA.

493
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,101
You need to tell them
Gus has a hit out on Hank.

494
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,188
You have to do it for me.
I gotta go on living here.

495
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,691
I'm way too comfortable in my--
Just call anonymously.

496
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,818
You call anonymously!
I can't!

497
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,862
I'm practically in the DEA family.

498
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,616
I go to their Christmas parties.
They know me. They know my voice.

499
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,368
They'll know me.
Please, you gotta do it for me.

500
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,871
Please. Please.
No.

501
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,499
My brother-in-law
doesn't deserve to die
because of this.

502
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,044
There's no way I'm mentioning Gus.

503
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:30,005
Okay.
The most I'll go--

504
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,716
I'll say it's the cartel.
They're back to finish the job.

505
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:37,095
You say whatever you have to say.
You just give me an hour to...

506
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,557
I need to collect my wife and kids.
Okay?

507
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:45,354
Give me an hour and then you make
the phone call. Don't forget. Please.

508
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,272
Yeah.

509
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,317
Thank you, Saul.

510
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,311
No, no, no.

511
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,022
Where's the rest?

512
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,485
That's not enough.
That's not enough.

513
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,490
- Walt?
- Down here!

514
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:45,163
Walt, what did that phone call mean?

515
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,541
Where is it?

516
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,419
Where's the rest?

517
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,797
The money, Skyler.
Where is the rest?

518
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,676
Skyler, where is the money?

519
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,935
I gave it to Ted.

520
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,562
What?

521
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,150
You did what?
Walt, I had to.

522
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,943
For us, for the family.

523
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,778
I swear, Walt--

524
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,323
You gave our money to Beneke?

525
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,786
Walt, please.
Please just hear me out. Please.

526
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:39,593
Walt.

527
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:47,309
Walt.

528
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:02,240
- Hi, you've reached the White family.
- Please leave a message.

529
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,368
Skyler.

530
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,037
It's happening again.

531
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:11,708
The DEA called, they got some tip
from an informant.

532
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,378
The cartel, they want to kill Hank.

533
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,422
Oh, God.

534
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:24,179
They're sending agents
to our house right now to guard us.

535
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,264
Oh, God.

536
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,558
When is this going to end?

537
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:34,189
Marie, I'm here.

538
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,982
I'm here.

539
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,985
Tell me exactly what happened.
