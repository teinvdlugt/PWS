1
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:09,419
Diane, 6:18 a.m., Room 315.

2
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,214
Great Northern Hotel
up here in Twin Peaks.

3
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:15,425
Slept pretty well. Non-smoking room.
There's no tobacco smell.

4
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,512
That's a nice consideration
for the business traveler.

5
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,599
A hint of Douglas fir needles
in the air.

6
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,351
As Sheriff Truman
indicated they would,

7
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,728
everything this hotel promised,
they've delivered.

8
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,023
Clean, reasonably priced
accommodations.

9
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,901
Telephone works.
Bathroom in really tiptop shape.

10
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,320
No drips, plenty of hot water
and good, steady pressure.

11
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,074
That could be a side benefit
of the waterfall outside my window.

12
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,868
Mattress firm, but not too firm.

13
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,662
And no lumps like that time
I told you about down in El Paso.

14
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,873
What a nightmare that was.

15
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,041
But you've heard me
tell that story once or twice,

16
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,376
haven't you, Diane?

17
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,378
Haven't tried the television set yet.

18
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,173
Looks like cable,
probably no reception problems.

19
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,885
But the true test of any hotel,
as you well know, Diane,

20
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,386
is that morning cup of coffee,

21
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,097
which I'll be getting back to you
about within a half hour.

22
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,360
Diane, it struck me again
earlier this morning.

23
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,404
There are two things
that continue to trouble me

24
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,781
and I'm speaking now
not only as an agent of the Bureau,

25
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,409
but also as a human being.

26
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,705
What really went on between
Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys?

27
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,083
And who really pulled the trigger
on JFK?

28
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,049
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

29
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:53,523
You know, this is, excuse me,
a damn fine cup of coffee.

30
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,818
I've had I can't tell you how many cups
of coffee in my life and this...

31
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,987
This is one of the best.

32
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,240
Now, I'd like two eggs, over hard.

33
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,825
I know, don't tell me,
it's hard on the arteries.

34
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,202
But old habits die hard.

35
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,079
Just about as hard
as I want those eggs.

36
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:11,917
Bacon, super crispy, almost burned.
Cremate it.

37
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,169
That's great.

38
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,797
And I'll have the grapefruit juice.

39
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,757
Just as long as those grapefruits...

40
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,469
...are freshly squeezed.

41
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,848
My name's Audrey Horne.

42
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,189
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

43
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,319
Can I sit here?

44
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,863
Well, Miss Horne,
unless I miss my guess,

45
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,075
your father is Benjamin Horne,
the owner of this fine establishment.

46
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,744
So I imagine you can sit
anywhere you'd like.

47
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,080
I'd also like to add
it would be my pleasure.

48
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,124
Thank you.

49
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,213
You're here investigating
the murder of Laura Palmer?

50
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,215
Were you friends with Laura Palmer?

51
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,803
Not exactly.

52
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,348
See, Laura tutored my older brother,
Johnny, three times a week.

53
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,977
Johnny's 27
and he's in the third grade.

54
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,854
He's got emotional problems.

55
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,231
Runs in the family.

56
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,066
Do you like my ring?

57
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,945
Very nice.

58
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,662
You know, sometimes
I get so flushed, it's interesting.

59
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,207
Do your palms ever itch?

60
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,556
Morning, deputy. Hey, Lucy.

61
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,391
Good morning, Agent Cooper.

62
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,145
Agent Cooper,
I got jelly for you special.

63
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,648
The sheriff's in the conference room.
It's the door across from the...

64
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,109
I'll look for him
in the conference room.

65
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,907
Hey, three for three.

66
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,869
Sheriff, let's get James Hurley up
from cell 4 and talk to him straight.

67
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,830
He was in love with Laura Palmer.
My bet is she told him whatever dirt

68
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,124
she knew about Mike and Bobby
and who knows what else.

69
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,543
Then let's have a little chat
with those two perpetrators.

70
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,463
Let's run a top-to-bottom on Bobby's
vehicle, see what that brings us.

71
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,256
Also check on the autopsy
on Laura Palmer

72
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,758
and see what that brings in.

73
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,094
We're also gonna wanna talk
to Mr. and Mrs. Palmer,

74
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,304
let's give them a few days
to deal with their grief.

75
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,599
I've got the rest of our day mapped out,
let's meet back here in three minutes.

76
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,559
Harry, I really have to urinate.

77
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,021
Oh. By the way,
coffee at the Great Northern?

78
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,481
Incredible.

79
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,534
Harry, as you know,
I delivered Laura.

80
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,162
I've known her all her life.
She was my daughter's best friend.

81
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,249
I couldn't bring myself
to do the postmortem,

82
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,586
so I called Joe Fielding in
from Fairvale.

83
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,506
He did the work, I assisted.

84
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,008
Well, this is what he found.

85
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,971
Time of death estimated
to be between midnight and 4 a.m.

86
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,640
What killed her is loss of blood.

87
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,975
Numerous shallow wounds,

88
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,645
no single one serious enough
to have caused death.

89
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,941
Bite marks on her shoulders,
also on her tongue.

90
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,695
Probably self-inflicted.

91
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:31,741
Lesions on wrists, ankles, upper arms,
where she was bound.

92
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:36,997
We're waiting on the toxological tests
for drug use.

93
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,834
Within the last 12 hours,

94
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:45,422
she'd had sexual relations
with at least three men.

95
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,800
You've examined
Ronnette Pulaski as well?

96
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,304
Yes, sir.
There's no question in my mind.

97
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:57,017
The same perpetrator attacked
both of them in that train car.

98
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:02,272
Doc, when, if ever,
will Ronnette be able to talk to us?

99
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:07,486
She had a severe head injury,
it's still early to tell.

100
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:13,575
Add to that
the psychological impact of the fear,

101
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,957
probably witnessing what was
happening to Laura before she...

102
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,380
So beautiful.

103
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,679
Who would do a thing like that?

104
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,017
Leo.

105
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:45,607
Leo, honey, I have to go to work now
and Norma should be here any sec.

106
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,735
Leo?

107
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,279
Did you finish cleaning my boots?

108
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,950
Yeah, I did them
and I did the laundry too.

109
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,118
All of it?

110
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,579
Well, yeah.

111
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,291
No, you didn't.

112
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,923
Okay, Leo, when I get home,
I'll do it.

113
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,092
Now, Shelly.

114
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,638
Okay.

115
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,538
Blood.

116
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,624
Shelly? Norma's here.

117
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,507
Shelly, did you hear me say
Norma's here?

118
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,176
Yeah, I heard you, Leo.

119
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,975
I'm gonna come by the diner
sometime today.

120
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,316
Be a good girl
and save me a piece of pie.

121
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,154
Sure, Leo.

122
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,125
James, you were placed under arrest
for suspicion of murder.

123
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,501
The murder of Laura Palmer.

124
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,296
Now, you have no previous
criminal record, is that correct?

125
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,964
None. No, sir.

126
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,308
Did you shoot this video?

127
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,653
That's your cycle, isn't it?

128
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,909
Yes, sir.

129
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,578
The three of us went up there
two Sundays ago.

130
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,792
James, you were in love with Laura.

131
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,087
The two of you
were seeing each other secretly.

132
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,591
No one else at school
or any of her friends knew about it.

133
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,677
She was the homecoming queen,

134
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,471
she was dating the captain
of the football team.

135
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,889
How much longer did you think

136
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,849
you could keep this relationship
a secret?

137
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,688
Yeah, well, it was secret
because that's the way she wanted it.

138
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,066
Why? Was she afraid of Bobby?

139
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,445
I think so.

140
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,699
Did you know
she was using cocaine?

141
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,910
Yes.

142
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,413
Did you ever use cocaine with her?

143
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,164
No, I tried to get her to stop.

144
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,419
- And she did for a while.
- Why did she start using again?

145
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,381
Something happened
a couple of days ago.

146
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,550
What? What happened?

147
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,803
I don't know.

148
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,265
I think something scared her
because she wouldn't see me.

149
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,891
She wouldn't even talk to me.

150
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,942
When was the last time you saw her?

151
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,321
The night she died.

152
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,451
She snuck out of her house
about 9:30.

153
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,038
About 12:30, I stopped the bike
at the light at Sparkwood and 21.

154
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,792
And she jumped off and ran away.

155
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,840
I didn't see her again.

156
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,138
Did you and Laura have a fight?

157
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,266
Not exactly.

158
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,352
But she said
she couldn't see me anymore.

159
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,812
Why?

160
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,858
She didn't say.

161
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,115
You recognize this necklace?

162
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,370
Yes, sir.

163
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,008
James, what happened
on February 5th?

164
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:26,054
And who has the other half
of this heart?

165
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,522
James, guess why
I'm so happy today.

166
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:40,026
Because your skin is so soft
and you smell so good?

167
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,404
- No.
- Why?

168
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,913
Because I really believe
that you love me.

169
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:59,254
Now my heart belongs to you.

170
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,635
I don't know.

171
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,100
Damn it.

172
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,813
Where's that shirt?

173
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,278
No!

174
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,123
Hey, Bopper.

175
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:39,085
Since when does Leo Johnson
call me at my parents' house?

176
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,713
Leo called you?

177
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,924
Yeah, yesterday.
He was looking for you.

178
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,386
He wanted to know where
the other half of the money was.

179
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,223
What did you tell him, Snake?

180
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,475
Well, as far as I knew,
he didn't have any of it yet.

181
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,852
Because I thought the deal was

182
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,021
we were supposed to give it to him
today.

183
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,523
Yeah, well,

184
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,651
I gave him half already.

185
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,782
When did you see him?

186
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:14,203
- Hey, I saw him the other night, okay?
- What night?

187
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,290
The night Laura died.

188
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,958
I went to see Leo

189
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:24,213
because I had this money burning
a $10,000 hole in my pocket.

190
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,091
What about the other half?

191
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:33,222
- It's in Laura's safe-deposit box.
- So you didn't get it back from her?

192
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,850
She was supposed
to hand it over today.

193
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,435
Then she went
and checked out on us.

194
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,688
So how are we supposed to get
10 grand for Leo?

195
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,940
I don't know, Snake.

196
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,900
Maybe we could sell light bulbs
door to door.

197
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,069
Oh, that's great, that's just...
That's just great.

198
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,364
- This isn't funny, Bobby.
- I'm not laughing.

199
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,199
We're lucky.
We're lucky we're in jail.

200
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,868
Because you know what's gonna go
down with Leo when we get out.

201
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,119
Shut up, man.

202
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,913
Don't mention one word
about Leo Johnson.

203
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,625
You do not know Leo Johnson.

204
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,721
Help me.

205
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,685
Mom.

206
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,146
Hi, honey.

207
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,981
Mom, it's 10:30.
Why didn't you wake me?

208
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,733
I was supposed to go
to the sheriff's office.

209
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,026
They called this morning

210
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,820
and said they could wait
until tomorrow to see you.

211
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,406
Your father and I thought
you needed your rest.

212
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,616
You woke us crying in your sleep
last night.

213
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,454
- Do you remember?
- No.

214
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,164
Really?

215
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,958
We feel so badly for you.

216
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,752
We're so sorry.

217
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,547
Mom, it's so strange.

218
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:36,512
I know I should be sad, and I am.
Part of me is.

219
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,016
But it's like...

220
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,687
It's like I'm having
the most beautiful dream

221
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,566
and the most terrible nightmare
all at once.

222
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,693
Your father said
you went out last night

223
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,570
to meet a boy named James Hurley.

224
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,447
Does this have anything to do
with him?

225
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,407
Can this be between you and me?

226
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,201
Of course it can.

227
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:03,289
James and Laura were seeing
each other the last two months.

228
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,958
I was the only one
who knew about it.

229
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,836
Mom, James was so good for her.

230
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,047
You don't know how troubled
Laura was.

231
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,424
Last night, I had to see him.

232
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,220
We were the two closest people
in the world to her.

233
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,349
But I feel so bad now.

234
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,434
Why, angel?

235
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,023
Because we realized...

236
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,402
...that all this time...

237
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,824
...we were the ones falling in love.

238
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,414
So I feel like
I've betrayed my best friend.

239
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,461
And if it's true,

240
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,341
then why am I so happy?

241
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,635
Oh, honey.

242
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,270
Now, you tell me what you wanna do.

243
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,231
Should we see these guys
separately or together?

244
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,275
- No, no, we can see them together.
- Okay.

245
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,278
Hey, Ed.

246
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,739
- How's that coconut?
- Well, it's kind of tender.

247
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,616
But my pride hurts worse.

248
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,078
Ed, this is Special Agent Dale Cooper.

249
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,247
- Pleasure.
- Any relation to James?

250
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,125
I'm his uncle
and he works in my garage.

251
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,878
His mother's out of town
and I look after him when she's away.

252
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,921
You fellas plan on holding him?

253
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,258
No, we can, uh,
release him into your custody.

254
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,677
Well, let me understand.
Is James being charged?

255
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,305
Well, I had one small doubt
which he cleared up for me.

256
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,931
He didn't kill anybody.

257
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,308
But you tell him to be careful

258
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,269
because we're gonna have to release
Mike and Bobby today as well.

259
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,021
- Will do.
- Agent Cooper,

260
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,191
I've got a call for you
from a Mr. Albert Rosenfield.

261
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,942
Sounds like long distance.

262
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,195
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

263
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:01,449
It has that open air sound, you know,
where it sounds like wind blowing?

264
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,993
- Like wind blowing through trees.
- Yes, Albert.

265
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,246
Harry, I've been thinking
about last night at the Roadhouse.

266
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,748
And something's not right.

267
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,374
Yeah, when I first saw that bandage,

268
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,628
I thought maybe old Nadine
caught wind of you and Norma.

269
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,463
Harry, if Nadine got wind of me
and Norma,

270
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,632
I'd be playing harp
for the Heavenly All-Stars.

271
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,883
Ain't that the truth?

272
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,386
I was there seeing Norma,
but I was also on my stakeout.

273
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,805
And I can remember Mike and Bobby
grabbing Donna

274
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,809
and I got up to walk over
and I got all lightheaded.

275
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,020
I was out on my feet
before I got there.

276
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,813
I don't even remember getting hit.

277
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,649
What do you mean
you don't remember?

278
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,651
Well, I'm pretty sure
my beer was drugged.

279
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,486
Jacques Renault was tending bar.

280
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,241
All right, Albert, bring the boys.

281
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,493
You can have the body
all day tomorrow.

282
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,746
No, I can't do it, they're gonna put her
in the ground on Monday.

283
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,040
Albert, listen.

284
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,002
If you come up through Lewis Fork,
I can recommend a place for lunch.

285
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,338
The Lamplighter Inn.

286
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:02,301
They got a cherry pie there
that'll kill you.

287
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,571
- Hi, Nadine.
- What are you doing here, Norma?

288
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,907
I might ask you the same question.

289
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,826
And I will tell you.

290
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,996
I've gotten all new drapes
for my house.

291
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,623
Ed bought them for me yesterday
at Gentleman Jim's.

292
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,042
And we installed them together.

293
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,794
They're a beige sheer.

294
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,549
I was up all last night.
Do you know what I was doing?

295
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,759
No, I don't.

296
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:49,181
I was inventing a noiseless,
completely silent drape runner.

297
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,436
And do you know how it works?
Do you know what makes it work?

298
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,604
The thing I thought of
at 4 this morning

299
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:59,775
when I was waiting for my husband
to be released from intensive care?

300
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,323
Cotton balls.

301
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:11,704
By God,
those things will be quiet now.

302
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,552
Did you have to post bail?

303
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,847
No, I had a talk with Harry.
There's no charge.

304
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,433
Mom still out of town?

305
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:36,103
Yeah, she's still out of town.
Let's get out of here.

306
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,022
Gonna need a hand
from the Bookhouse Boys.

307
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:42,693
- Somebody's gotta watch my back.
- Already got it covered.

308
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,656
Hi, Mike.

309
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,492
Bobby.

310
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,287
Well, before we get started, have you
two fellas got your stories straight?

311
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:59,251
If we tell the truth, we don't have
to get our stories straight.

312
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,837
Besides, the sheriff told us
we're just in here for fighting.

313
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,964
And, uh, it was self-defense.

314
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,175
Right.

315
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,844
Well, I guess you can go, then.

316
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,598
- Now?
Mm-hm.

317
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,438
Oh, fellas, one more thing.

318
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,440
Pray for the health and safety
of James Hurley

319
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,528
because if anything happens to him,
we're coming for you.

320
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,159
Sheriff,
what are you sitting around for?

321
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,869
We got places to go
and people to see.

322
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,913
Yeah, I think I better start
studying medicine.

323
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,164
Why's that?

324
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:41,127
Because I'm beginning to feel
a bit like Dr. Watson.

325
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,888
On top of the morning to you, Pete.

326
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:59,562
Uh, no, Josie, the expression
is "top of the morning."

327
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,815
And it's just barely morning.

328
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,653
Pete,

329
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:13,284
I want to thank you for yesterday.
For standing up to me with Catherine.

330
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:18,873
Forget it.
Catherine was wrong yesterday.

331
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,293
- Period.
- Well, thank you anyway.

332
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,756
- Hello.
- Pete, it's Harry.

333
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,718
I got Agent Cooper with me.
We're here to see Mrs. Packard.

334
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:38,767
Um, I will make a fresh pot of coffee.

335
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,611
- Hi, sheriff.
- Mrs. Packard.

336
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,529
Dale Cooper, FBI.

337
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,073
You remember him from
the town meeting last night, I'm sure.

338
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,575
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

339
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,368
Agent Cooper,
you remember Pete Martell.

340
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,370
- Sure, Pete.
- You bet.

341
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,207
Uh, can we offer you gentlemen
a cup of joe?

342
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,167
Mrs. Packard,
you said the magic word.

343
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:07,546
- I'd love a cup, thanks.
- Sure, I'll pour that for you.

344
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,675
Uh, Mr. Cooper, uh,
how do you take it?

345
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:15,179
Black as midnight
on a moonless night.

346
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,388
Pretty black.

347
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:20,351
- Um, please sit down.
- Thank you.

348
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,856
Mrs. Packard,
I'll come straight to the point.

349
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,192
Mrs. Packard, I understand
that you hired Laura Palmer

350
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,445
to come visit you twice a week to help
you with your English, is that correct?

351
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,113
Yes.

352
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,116
When was the last time
that you saw her?

353
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:40,037
Thursday afternoon,
about the time the mill blew 5.

354
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,207
- That would be 5:00?
- Yes.

355
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,458
And when did she leave?

356
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,711
In an hour,
when the lesson was finished.

357
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,047
I didn't see her again.

358
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,758
How did she seem to you
on Thursday afternoon?

359
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,843
Something was bothering her.

360
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,556
But we didn't have
a heart-to-heart on it.

361
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:03,602
Something she said though,
that stuck on my mind.

362
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,272
She said,

363
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:10,651
"I think now I understand how you feel
about your husband's death."

364
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,238
Did she say
what that was in reference to?

365
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,574
No.

366
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:22,371
But after what happened to her,
I can't help hearing it in my head.

367
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,456
Like some haunting melody.

368
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,626
Hmm.

369
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,005
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

370
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,802
So, Harry,
how long you been seeing her?

371
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,099
How did you know?

372
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,143
Body language.

373
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,605
Jeez Louise.

374
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,735
Not long. Six weeks.

375
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,864
Andrew died a year and a half ago.

376
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,953
Fellas, don't drink that coffee.

377
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:10,002
You'd never guess.
There was a fish in the percolator.

378
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,757
Sorry.

379
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,728
Yes, Catherine, I'm listening.

380
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,355
I just thought you ought to know

381
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:33,150
what your sentimental, goodwill
shenanigans cost us yesterday.

382
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,402
You do know what shenanigans are,
don't you?

383
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:42,409
Shutting down the mill
cost us $87,000 and change.

384
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,872
You really think that would have made
brother Andrew happy.

385
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,071
Jocelyn? Mrs. Packard?

386
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:23,200
Uh, what is "shenanigans?"

387
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:28,539
Nonsense, mischief,
often a deceitful or treacherous trick.

388
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,421
Why do you always have
to rush off?

389
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,090
It's been over an hour.

390
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,550
I remember there was a time

391
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,970
when we used to take
the whole afternoon.

392
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:49,143
In the sweetness of passing time,
this hour will soon seem like a day.

393
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,814
Sing it to somebody else.
I'm no peabrain chambermaid

394
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,191
looking for a tumble
in the broom closet.

395
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,235
I'm sorry.

396
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,821
Didn't mean to offend
your delicate sensibilities.

397
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,656
Oh, no. My mistake.

398
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,034
I'd gotten used to our
conducting business and pleasure.

399
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,370
Sweetheart,

400
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,206
it's all the same to me.

401
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,544
Don't "sweetheart" me, you old dog.

402
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,756
I'm no schoolgirl either.

403
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,925
What's the next step?

404
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,844
Do we escalate?

405
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,263
We may not have to do anything.

406
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,475
A few more, uh, local tragedies

407
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:33,896
and Josie might just run the old mill
into the ground all by herself.

408
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:39,193
The rate we're going, it's gonna be
years before the mill's bankrupt.

409
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,611
I don't wanna wait any longer.

410
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,032
Besides, my knothead husband
may peek in the ledger

411
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:48,035
and sniff out the creative arithmetic.

412
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:53,582
Maybe it's time to, uh,
start a little fire.

413
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,543
Are you talking about business
or pleasure?

414
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:02,424
I'm talking about
the Packard sawmill.

415
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:11,892
All that dry timber lying around.

416
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,436
A stray spark.

417
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,772
One night.

418
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:21,777
Some night when Pete's off on a toot
with Smokey the Bear.

419
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,239
Now I remember...

420
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:32,287
...how all those hours
turned into days.

421
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,803
Sarah, darling.

422
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,431
I'm sorry to disturb you, sweetheart,

423
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,767
but, uh, Donna Hayward is here.

424
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,562
Take this now.

425
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,606
I'll send her in.

426
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,613
- Try not to upset her.
- Okay.

427
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,380
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

428
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:29,678
I miss her so much.

429
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,848
Do you miss her?

430
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,685
Yes, I miss her so much.

431
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:49,489
I miss her so much.

432
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,961
Laura.

433
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:08,508
Oh, Laura, my baby.

434
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,553
Oh. Oh.

435
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,358
Leland, Leland.

436
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:45,170
So neither of you saw Ronnette
after school that day?

437
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,423
That's right.

438
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,218
And as far as you know,
she went to her after-school job?

439
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,930
Yes, Horne's Department Store
downtown.

440
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,933
What did she do
at the department store?

441
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:05,273
She was, uh, a salesgirl.

442
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,901
At perfume counter.

443
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:13,490
She used to joke it was the
sweetest smelling job she'd ever had.

444
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,003
Excuse me.

445
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,747
How many times have I asked you

446
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:48,627
not to disturb the guests
with this racket?

447
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,463
About 4000.

448
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,182
Audrey,

449
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:12,025
Julie tells me that, uh,
you were in with the Norwegians

450
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:16,696
just before they all suddenly decided,
en masse,

451
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,407
to return to the old country...

452
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:25,163
...without signing the contracts.

453
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,082
Is that true?

454
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,001
- Yes.
- Ah.

455
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,713
You wouldn't have, uh,
done or said anything

456
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:39,219
that, uh, might have precipitated
their evacuation, would you?

457
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:43,974
I mean, I'm assuming
that this was just a coincidence.

458
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,893
- Huh?
- Daddy.

459
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:52,190
I did go in there to check out
that ridiculous smorgasbord.

460
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:57,154
And while I was in there,
I happened to mention that I was sad.

461
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,868
About what?

462
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:09,291
About my dear, close friend Laura
being brutally murdered.

463
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,716
Do you realize

464
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:22,470
the kind of money that your
little performance just cost this family?

465
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:28,518
If you ever pull
another stunt like that,

466
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,479
you are going to be scrubbing bidets
in a Bulgarian convent.

467
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,983
Oh, Daddy, I'm so afraid.

468
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,699
Laura died two days ago.

469
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,495
I lost you years ago.

470
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,892
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

471
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,101
Amen.

472
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:14,314
Robert, uh, I was hoping
we'd have the chance

473
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,650
to discuss the events
of the past few days.

474
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,527
Not necessarily
the physical events themselves,

475
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,406
but rather, the thoughts
and feelings surrounding it.

476
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:29,579
Rebellion in a young man your age
is a necessary fact of life.

477
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,082
Candidly, a sign of strength.

478
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,084
In other words, Robert,

479
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,003
I respect your rebellious nature.

480
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,047
However, being your father,

481
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,342
I am obligated to contain
that fire of contrariness

482
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,386
within the bounds
established by society

483
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,722
as well as those
within our own family structure.

484
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:54,896
Robert, I note your reluctance to enter
into a dialogue with me, your father.

485
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,109
There are times
when silence is golden.

486
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,862
Silence can be taken many ways,
as a sign of intelligence.

487
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:07,784
The quieter we become,
the more we hear.

488
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,411
Ah!

489
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:15,709
Now, I am a tolerant man.
My patience has its limits.

490
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,878
To have his path made clear
is the aspiration of every human being

491
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:22,716
in our beclouded
and tempestuous existence.

492
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:26,219
Robert, you and I are going to work
to make yours real clear.

493
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,395
We're here for you, Bobby.

494
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,281
Can I get you anything
to go with that, sheriff?

495
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,826
Agent Cooper here might wanna try
a slice of that pie.

496
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,912
- Cherry pie?
- Best in the tri-counties.

497
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,748
Hmm.

498
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,667
And could you ask Norma
to stop by a second, Shelly?

499
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,253
- Sure thing.
- Nothing's a sure thing, Shelly.

500
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,967
Man, I still can't get the taste
of that fish-filtered coffee

501
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,970
- out of my mouth.
- Me neither.

502
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:13,558
- That's Shelly Johnson, with a J?
- Mm-hm.

503
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,269
Husband's a trucker, Leo.

504
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,229
Minor rap sheet.

505
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,780
Log Lady?

506
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,449
- Right.
- Hi.

507
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,162
Can I ask her about her log?

508
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,831
Many have.

509
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,668
Evening, Harry.

510
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,381
Norma, like to have you meet
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

511
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,840
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

512
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,592
Norma Jennings.

513
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,844
Miss Jennings, is it true
that Laura used to help you

514
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,262
with the Meals on Wheels program,

515
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,139
delivering hot dinners
to elderly shut-ins?

516
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,891
Yeah, Laura helped organize
that program.

517
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,561
Do you have the names of the people
on her route?

518
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,314
- I can get them for you.
- Mm. Would you, please?

519
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,692
And, uh, two more pieces
of this incredible pie.

520
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,196
Okay.

521
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:13,618
Man, oh, man, you must have
the metabolism of a bumblebee.

522
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,123
For your information,

523
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:21,126
I heard you speaking
about Laura Palmer.

524
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,919
Yes.

525
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:27,757
One day, my log will have
something to say about this.

526
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,677
My log saw something that night.

527
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,930
Really? What did it see?

528
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,016
Ask it.

529
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,440
I thought so.

530
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,244
Thanks, Norma. See you tomorrow.

531
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,508
Hi, Leo.

532
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,386
Brought you some pie.

533
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,059
Where's my shirt?

534
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,729
What shirt?

535
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,523
My favorite blue shirt.

536
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,862
It's the second one
you lost this year.

537
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,490
I'm gonna teach you a lesson now,
Shelly,

538
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,033
about taking care of my property.

539
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,327
That means making sure
things aren't lost or damaged.

540
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,870
Oh, God, please, Leo.

541
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,413
- This is gonna hurt you.
- No.

542
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,374
No!

543
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,843
I'll get it.

544
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,142
Come on.

545
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,815
Uh, Mom, Dad, this is James.
James Hurley.

546
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,485
- How do you do, James?
- Nice to see you, sir, Mrs. Hayward.

547
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,154
Very nice to meet you, James.

548
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,115
Well, I hope you're hungry.

549
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:20,161
- Eileen's been cooking up a storm.
- Yes, sir.

550
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,205
Would you like something to drink?

551
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:25,083
We have some soft drinks
and some fruit punch,

552
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,543
some sparkling cider.

553
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,546
Uh, fruit punch.
That'd be good, thank you.

554
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,881
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

555
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,133
Uh, why don't you fellas
sit down at the table

556
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,970
and I'll go check on the roast.

557
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,111
- Here's your fruit punch.
- Thanks, Donna.

558
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,822
I don't believe
I know your parents, James.

559
00:42:56,031 --> 00:43:00,326
No, sir. My dad died when I was 10
and my mom travels a lot.

560
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,912
- She writes for the paper sometimes.
- Oh.

561
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,207
Ed Hurley down at the Gas Farm
is James' uncle.

562
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,502
His, uh,
wife's the lady with the patch.

563
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,797
Yes, sir, that's my Aunt Nadine.
She's a real character.

564
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,302
Will? Could you come
give me a hand, please?

565
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,388
Uh, excuse me.

566
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,185
We can talk after dinner.

567
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,271
It's good to see you.

568
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,565
It's good to see you too.

569
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,668
That bastard.

570
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,713
First your girlfriend, then mine.

571
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:59,302
Too bad we can only kill him once.

572
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,226
Hey, what's up, doc?

573
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,896
It's Laura Palmer
in case you haven't guessed.

574
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,899
I'm making you
another one of these tapes,

575
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,942
which, as you already know,

576
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:19,280
I've mailed to you
in one of the envelopes you gave me.

577
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:24,619
It's Thursday the 23rd
and I'm so bored.

578
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:28,081
Actually,
I'm in kind of a weird mood.

579
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:37,632
God, James is sweet,
but he's so dumb.

580
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,302
I should have met you
a long time ago, Dr. Jacoby,

581
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:46,140
because right now,
I can take just so much of sweet.

582
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,603
I just know I'm gonna get lost
in those woods again tonight.

583
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,980
I just know it.

584
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,735
Remember me telling you
about that mystery man?

585
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,654
Well...
