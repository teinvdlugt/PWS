1
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,512
You can come on out.

2
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,232
It's an actual store.
Mm-hm.

3
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,071
I guess I figured "vacuum cleaner
repair" was a term of art.

4
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,555
If you would step right here
on this blue spot.

5
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,599
Leave your luggage
where it is for the moment.

6
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,433
That good?

7
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,233
Sure.
What about this?

8
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,995
I'll Photoshop that out.

9
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,755
Oh, Nebraska.
What's in Nebraska?

10
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,754
You. From now on.

11
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,672
It's gonna take me some time
to get your new situation fixed.

12
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,153
Until then, you're gonna be staying here.
I got a place downstairs, out of sight.

13
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,553
It's not the Ritz-Carlton, but it's
comfortable enough for short-term.

14
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,040
How short-term?

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,114
Considering you got your face up
on buses and billboards all over town,

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,559
I'm thinking, uh, two days.

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,433
Maybe three.

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,638
Only thing is,

19
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,712
and I don't like to do this,

20
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,351
but, uh,
you'll have a bunk mate.

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,558
Oh, yeah? He's still here?

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,154
For the moment.

23
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,910
He's a special case.
Gonna take some doing.

24
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,318
How's he holding up?

25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,752
You be the judge.

26
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,191
We will find Hank.

27
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,359
Steve too.

28
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,235
They're out there,
and we're gonna find them.

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,437
You have my word.

30
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,240
Sir.

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,954
Call it in, get her out of here. Move.

32
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,752
<i>I, uh, get to his door,</i>

33
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,357
<i>and I could hear music inside.</i>

34
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,876
<i>Like squeaky voices.</i>

35
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,596
<i>And I thought, you know, maybe, uh...</i>

36
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,510
<i>I knocked on his door.</i>

37
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,078
<i>The music stopped,
and then he was right there.</i>

38
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,995
<i>When he saw the gun, he thought...</i>

39
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,594
Hey, Kenny.

40
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,355
Does this pussy cry
through the entire thing?

41
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,194
Just watch.

42
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,910
<i>He kept saying that, you know,
"You don't have to do this."</i>

43
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,639
<i>His eyes were so big.</i>

44
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,677
<i>They high-fived because it worked.</i>
Such a bitch. He won't quit.

45
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,957
<i>Then, you know, we turn around</i>

46
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,280
<i>and there is this kid on a dirt bike</i>

47
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,193
<i>looking at us.</i>

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,753
<i>Drew Sharp.</i>

49
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,873
<i>That kid that went missing
up in White Horse.</i>

50
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,520
<i>It's him.</i>

51
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,359
<i>And then out of nowhere,</i>

52
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,594
<i>Todd, that Opie,
dead-eyed piece of shit,</i>

53
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,993
<i>pulls out a gun and shoots the kid.</i>

54
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,516
<i>This is Todd Alquist
we're talking about?</i>

55
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,478
<i>He killed Drew Sharp?</i>

56
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,597
<i>Boom. Like it was nothing.</i>

57
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,553
Hey, Uncle Jack. Hold up.

58
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,636
We should keep him for a while,
get a couple of cooks under our belt.

59
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,514
You seriously giving me
this turn-the-other-cheek crap?

60
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,350
He ratted you out, personally.
We still got 600 gallons of methylamine.

61
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,638
Meth? Who gives a shit about meth?
We won the lottery here.

62
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,636
We've got all the money in the world.
You're talking to me about selling crank?

63
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,792
I mean, this is millions,
Uncle Jack.

64
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,192
No matter how much you got,
how do you turn your back on more?

65
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,240
You little...

66
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,551
son of a bitch.

67
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,920
It's that Lydia woman.

68
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,959
You're sweet on her, you little bastard.
Ha, ha, ha.

69
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,916
Hey, Kenny, you believe this?
Hey, it's all about this right here, huh?

70
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,598
Come on.

71
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,276
You can do better.

72
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,913
That one's so uptight, probably
got a wood chipper for a coochie.

73
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,958
Stick it in down there,
you're pulling back a stump.

74
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,436
Oh, what the hell?

75
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,069
Heart wants what
the heart wants, right?

76
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,070
Let's go back and watch some
more of that crybaby rat, huh?

77
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,036
How thick is it?

78
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,354
This is mild steel?

79
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,874
Uh-huh.

80
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,631
No, this would be cash.

81
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,794
What?

82
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,796
Nothing.

83
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,753
Hey, you know what?

84
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,479
Make yourself useful.

85
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,677
Give me a list of hitters,
mercenaries.

86
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,714
Yes, yes, I remember.
You've got "concerns."

87
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,157
Don't worry.
We'll take the time to vet them.

88
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,552
Make sure there are no
undercover cops on the team.

89
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,959
Five should do it, providing
they're the right men for the job.

90
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,276
I'm gonna hate myself for asking,
but who are we hitting?

91
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,472
Jack Welker and his men.

92
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,439
They murdered Hank.
They stole my life's work.

93
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,157
I don't know any hit men.

94
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,710
You know a guy
who knows a guy.

95
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,038
Just get me the contacts.
Anybody in that world.

96
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,999
I'm paying top dollar.
We'll find them.

97
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,675
You mind if I give you
a nickel's worth of advice?

98
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,991
Just for old time's sake?

99
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,550
You're worried about
your wife and kids?

100
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,949
Don't leave.

101
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,033
The way things are now,
some people-- Not me, mind you,

102
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,034
but some people might say
you're leaving her high and dry.

103
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,469
Some people would be
ignorant on the facts.

104
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,793
Some people wouldn't know that as
far as the police are concerned,

105
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,794
Skyler is a blameless victim.

106
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,193
No, no, no. Go ahead.

107
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,397
Get it off your chest.

108
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,313
Go on.

109
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,075
The phone call was
a smart move. Kudos to you.

110
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,074
Odds are it was recorded.
It'll play great for a jury.

111
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,118
It might even buy her
a mistrial.

112
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,600
In a year and a half. Until then, if
they don't have you, they go after her.

113
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,596
There's no point. She knows nothing.
Well, too bad. She's got nothing to trade.

114
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,114
I hate to be a downer here,

115
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,239
but there are two DEA agents
missing, presumed dead.

116
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,831
Think the feds will let that go
because you hit the ejector seat?

117
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,279
First thing they're gonna do, they will
RICO your wife and kids out of the house.

118
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,159
That condo is gone.

119
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,152
Your bank accounts,
they're frozen.

120
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,234
Her picture is probably on TV right now,
next to yours. Who's gonna hire her?

121
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,871
Money is no problem.
Well, I don't mean to contradict you,

122
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,191
but getting it to her, impossible.

123
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,795
The feds are praying
that you'll make contact.

124
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,270
The Internet, the phone,
it's all tapped.

125
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,716
Hey, Mike was no dummy.

126
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,590
But every time he tried to get
his nest egg to his granddaughter,

127
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,877
it ended up
in Uncle Sam's pockets.

128
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,714
So you propose what?

129
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,874
Stay. Face the music.

130
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,196
I mean, how much time have you got left?
You walk in with your head held high,

131
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,876
be the John Dillinger of the Metropolitan
Detention Center. How bad is that?

132
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,117
And you bring a barrel
full of drug money.

133
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,556
Maybe that soothes
some troubled waters.

134
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,440
Maybe they let your family stay
in the house.

135
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,832
After all, the house predates
the criminal enterprise.

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,957
God, you think I want to run?!

137
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,680
This is the last thing
that I want.

138
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,833
This-- This changes nothing.

139
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,630
What I do, I do for my family.

140
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,917
My money goes to my children.

141
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,151
Not just this barrel. All of it!

142
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,917
I'm going to kill Jack
and his entire crew,

143
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,596
and I'm gonna take back what is mine
and give it to my children.

144
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,400
And then, and only then...

145
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,839
am I through.

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,037
Do you understand?

147
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,956
Everything good?

148
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,713
Define "good."

149
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,676
You're set. Time to go.

150
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,190
You'll be a little longer.

151
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,397
I'm still working on transportation.

152
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,960
Change of plans.

153
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,236
He's coming with me.

154
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,031
No. No, that's not--
We're going together. I can use him.

155
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,510
I'll give you two a minute.

156
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,359
Hey, I'm a civilian.
I'm not your lawyer anymore.

157
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,311
I'm nobody's lawyer. The fun is over.
From here on out, I'm Mr. Low-Profile.

158
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,915
A douche bag with a job
and three pairs of Dockers.

159
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,589
If I'm lucky, month from now,
best-case scenario,

160
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,832
I'm managing a Cinnabon in Omaha.
You're still part of this,

161
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,477
whether you like it or not.
Sorry. I don't think so.

162
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,915
You remember what I told you?

163
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,839
It's not over until--

164
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,473
It's over.

165
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,119
Do you want us to cuff her now?
Would that make you feel better?

166
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,552
Your client admits to...

167
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,634
Her day of reckoning is now.

168
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,750
--by the time this goes to trial.

169
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,794
Is she even listening?

170
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,559
Mrs. White?

171
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,678
Are you following all this?

172
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,951
Do you understand
what's happening here?

173
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,234
Yes.

174
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,198
I understand.

175
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,118
I understand I'm in terrible trouble.

176
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,154
I understand that you will use
everything in your power

177
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,876
against me and my children unless--

178
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,236
Unless I give you Walt.

179
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,711
But the truth is,
I can't give you what you want.

180
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,550
I don't know where he is.

181
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,149
All right, go and discuss this
with your lawyer here.

182
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,037
Rack your brain.

183
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,278
And hope you can come up
with something we can use.

184
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,872
<i>Four-seventeen?</i>

185
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,791
Four-seventeen. No activity.

186
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,440
Ma'am, is there anybody else
in the house?

187
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,280
What about your son?

188
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,638
If I go look in his room,
am I gonna see him?

189
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,354
He's not gonna pop out
and surprise me?

190
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,916
If this guy takes his hand away,
are you gonna scream?

191
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,512
He's at his friend's house.

192
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,512
He's been there all week.

193
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,514
Please, please, don't hurt my baby.

194
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,479
Please-- Please.
Ma'am.

195
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,119
We got a lot of respect
for your husband.

196
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,438
There's just something
that we gotta straighten out.

197
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,959
Okay, we know that you've
been talking to the police,

198
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,034
and that's okay.
You gotta do that.

199
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,999
But you've seen some people.

200
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,156
Like that lady
who came into the car wash.

201
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,551
The one with the black hair.

202
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,110
You said anything about her?

203
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,989
No.

204
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,353
You sure about that?

205
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,993
I didn't.

206
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,316
The police don't need
to know anything about her.

207
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,790
Okay, ma'am,
I'm gonna need you to say it.

208
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,798
I will not

209
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,233
say anything about her. Ever.

210
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,680
I swear.

211
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,959
Okay.

212
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,789
When we leave, you're not gonna go running
to those police officers out front?

213
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,834
No.

214
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,440
Okay.

215
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,080
Okay.

216
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,952
Because you really
don't want us coming back.

217
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,513
Uh-huh. Sure.

218
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,070
Don't. Stay where you are.

219
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,038
We'll talk like this.

220
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,360
Okay.

221
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,151
So that thing that we talked about,
I went to Mr. and Mrs. White's house--

222
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,439
You don't have to say the name.

223
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,392
Sure. And it went really good.

224
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,634
I mean, the message was received
loud and clear.

225
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,271
The message? Yeah.

226
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,114
Look, I know you did your best.
I just think--

227
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,112
Hi. What can I get you?

228
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,590
Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.

229
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,229
And I'll need more stevia.
Sure.

230
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,510
The person we're discussing
saw my face.

231
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,040
You're not Western Union.

232
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,193
We can't just settle
for you sending messages.

233
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,552
Really, if you'd been there,
I think you'd see it different.

234
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,598
We threw a real scare into her.

235
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,834
She seems like a nice lady
watching out for her kids.

236
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,309
So you're not going to have
a problem with her.

237
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,791
I can pretty much guarantee it.
I wish I had your certainty,

238
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,513
but I'm not like you and your uncle.
I'm just-- I'm not used to this kind of risk.

239
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,990
We're gonna have to take a break.

240
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,075
I have 50 pounds vacuum-packed
and ready to go.

241
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,517
And I wish you all the luck
in the world with it.

242
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,233
It's 92 percent.

243
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,513
I'm sorry?

244
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,270
Ninety-two percent.

245
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,754
Truly?
Tested it twice.

246
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,391
And it's blue, just like before.

247
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,430
Ninety-two.
That's Heisenberg level.

248
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,912
He's not with you?

249
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,954
Well, next best thing.
Pinkman.

250
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,075
They're looking for Pinkman.

251
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,594
Well, they're not going to find him. He's
with us and he's not going anywhere.

252
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,558
Ms. Quayle, this is what your guys in
Europe have been begging for, right?

253
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,910
I just think we work together good.

254
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,391
We make a good team.

255
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,316
I think it's kind of

256
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,711
mutually good.

257
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,911
Ninety-two percent.

258
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,594
Unh.

259
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,555
Unh.

260
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,071
Mr. Lambert,
welcome to New Hampshire.

261
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,673
All right.

262
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,275
Let's have a look at this place.

263
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,072
You got about a month's worth
of food on hand.

264
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,240
Most of it is canned goods,
but there's steaks in the freezer.

265
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,996
You got a generator outside,
works on LP.

266
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,760
Ought to be enough in the tank
to last the winter.

267
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,473
It's only 15 amps, but that ought to do
for the lights, the TV and the freezer.

268
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,915
That's a wood-burner.

269
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,356
Ought to warm the place up
pretty good.

270
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,830
Plus you can cook on it.

271
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,792
On the TV front,
the reception's pretty much nil.

272
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,520
You got some mountains
in the way.

273
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,554
Weather is right, you might
be able to catch Montreal,

274
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,315
but mostly
you'll be limited to DVDs.

275
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,991
<i>Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.</i>

276
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,793
Two copies. Hm.

277
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,789
I'm not much of a movie guy.

278
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,352
I'll make a supply run
next month.

279
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,878
You want something else
to watch, put it on the list.

280
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,316
Supply run. Heh.

281
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,314
Fifty thousand dollars
for a trip to Costco.

282
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,800
It's risk.

283
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,911
And risk is what you're paying
me for, not toilet paper.

284
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,756
Risk and a 4400-mile
round trip.

285
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,238
Mr. Lambert,

286
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,516
my clients and I don't usually
have an ongoing relationship.

287
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,957
Normally you and I would have
already gone our separate ways,

288
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,680
but you're you.

289
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,513
Where's the phone?
No phone.

290
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,120
Up here, ice storms equal service
calls, equal you in cuffs.

291
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,836
Internet?
Same deal.

292
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,478
Also satellite, cable TV,
drop phone, car.

293
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,072
You want news,
I'll bring the Albuquerque papers.

294
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,995
Whatever you need, just put it on the list.
Put it on the list. Yeah.

295
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,720
Look, I have business to conduct.

296
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,159
Your business is your business.

297
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,199
My business is keeping you
out of custody.

298
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,353
You are the target
of a nation-wide manhunt.

299
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,557
Your face is all over TV.

300
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,317
You are the hottest client
I have ever had, by far.

301
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,517
It stands to reason
you've got to keep out of sight.

302
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,952
And what's keeping me
from walking out that gate?

303
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,600
Nothing.

304
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,717
There's a little one-horse town
eight miles down the hill.

305
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,116
There's not a thing
on God's green earth

306
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,795
that I can do to stop you
going down there.

307
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,440
All I'm saying is...

308
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,114
if you leave this place,
you will get caught.

309
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,393
And I gotta tell you,

310
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,230
if I find out that
you've left the reservation,

311
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,718
I won't be coming back.

312
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,590
That is for my own safety.
You understand?

313
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,594
Sure.

314
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,474
Know how to work
the stove?

315
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,474
The flue can be tricky.
Yeah, I got it.

316
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,432
You paid good money for this.

317
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,150
You got two acres up here,
lots of woods, nice, warm place.

318
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,274
Seems to me just the spot for a man
to rest up and think on things.

319
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,837
If you look around,
it's kind of beautiful.

320
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,513
You've been very helpful.
Thank you.

321
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,479
See you in a month.

322
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,193
Tomorrow.

323
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,439
Tomorrow.

324
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,271
Oh. Huh.

325
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,556
Come--

326
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,400
Oh, so you're just too good
to eat with the rest of us, huh?

327
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,320
- It's not for me.
- Damn, man, seriously.

328
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,075
That's not my chocolate chip,
is it?

329
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,392
You're gonna spoil him.

330
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,799
Hey, you awake?

331
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,792
Uh, yeah.

332
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,789
We had some Ben & Jerry's.

333
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,439
There's peanut butter cup
and AmeriCone Dream.

334
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,513
I didn't know what you liked,
so I got you some of each.

335
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,993
There you go.

336
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,038
So that batch that you just cooked
was 96 percent.

337
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,672
Kind of figured you deserved
a little something.

338
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,914
Thanks.

339
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,200
Well, better get some sleep.

340
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,317
Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.

341
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,954
Got a whole new batch.

342
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,716
Hey, Todd.
Yeah?

343
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,794
Would you mind
leaving the tarp off tonight?

344
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,074
Well, might get cold.

345
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,630
No, I don't mind. I just...

346
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,076
I just wanna see the stars.

347
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,319
Sure. Okay.

348
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,994
Thanks.

349
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,557
Well, good night, Jesse.

350
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,194
Night.

351
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,760
Okay. Okay. Okay.

352
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,594
Okay.

353
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,395
Come on, bitch.

354
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,080
Go ahead! Do it!

355
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,479
Just kill me now and get it over with,
because there's no way

356
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,156
I'm doing one more cook
for you psycho fucks!

357
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,634
Yes?
Hi, ma'am. How you doing tonight?

358
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,280
You're Andrea, right?

359
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,594
How can I help you?

360
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,639
You know Jesse Pinkman?

361
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,998
Right? Well, I'm a friend of his.
My name's Todd.

362
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,872
I'm sorry to bother you so late,
but it's nice to meet you.

363
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,312
How is Jesse? Is he okay?

364
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,834
Yeah, he's okay.

365
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,157
Actually, I brought him with me.

366
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,595
Jesse's here?

367
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,039
Yeah, he's right over there
in that truck.

368
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,075
Where?

369
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,639
No!

370
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,352
Just so you know,
this isn't personal.

371
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,149
No!

372
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,191
Whoa, hey, settle down.

373
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,713
Settle down.

374
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,554
Hey, remember.

375
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,712
There's still the kid.

376
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,114
I brought you a couple of cases of Ensure.
Maybe put a little weight on you.

377
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,509
Jesus.

378
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,234
I can barely read this.

379
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,471
Ah. Almost forgot.

380
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,390
Without a prescription, I had to take
an educated guess and shotgun it.

381
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,069
One of these ought to come close.
Oh.

382
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,392
Did you check on them?

383
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,199
Is Skyler in a better place?

384
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,632
No, she's still at that place
off of Eubank.

385
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,156
Kids are both still with her
for the moment.

386
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,793
There's no court date yet.

387
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,512
The news was talking about a grand
jury, but they didn't say when.

388
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,117
I saw her public defender
on TV.

389
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,556
Looks like a deer
in the headlights.

390
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,360
Think I got socks older
than him.

391
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,716
What are they doing for money?

392
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,917
She's doing taxi dispatch,
part-time.

393
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,632
Leaves the baby with a neighbor
when she goes in.

394
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,877
I saw her shopping one time.

395
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,474
She looks pretty good.

396
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,075
And she's using her
maiden name.

397
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,836
I wouldn't take that personally,
under the circumstances.

398
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,151
Those working for you?

399
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,993
Yeah, yeah.

400
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,950
I took a run
by your old house.

401
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,435
The auction's still pending.

402
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,478
They put a fence up around it.

403
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,756
They put up a fence?

404
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,079
Seems like the place got to be kind of
a tourist attraction. Kids breaking in.

405
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,359
The neighbors complained,
so the bank put up a fence.

406
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,715
You ready?
Hm?

407
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,154
Yeah.

408
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,395
Sorry about last time.

409
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,400
It should go better now.
I watched a couple of YouTube videos.

410
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,473
It's all about finding the vein.

411
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,391
Give it to me. I'll do it.

412
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,633
Here, you do it.

413
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,151
Make a fist. Tight.
There we go.

414
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,233
All right, it's just...

415
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,800
Stick.

416
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,031
That's it. Okay. Hey.

417
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,596
Pretty good.
There you go.

418
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,391
Think I had worse
my last physical.

419
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,069
I will see you on...

420
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,276
Let's see.

421
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,036
Afternoon of the 15th.

422
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,396
Stay a little longer?

423
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,273
Yeah, I got a long trip ahead of me.

424
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,553
Two hours?

425
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,037
I'll give you another $10,000.

426
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,760
Please.

427
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,039
Ten thousand.

428
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,998
One hour.

429
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,554
Cards?

430
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,637
All right, well...

431
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,757
The game will be seven-card.

432
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,396
I'll deal,
since you are encumbered.

433
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,959
One of these days,
when you come up here,

434
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,832
I'll be dead.

435
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,031
My money over there.

436
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,036
What happens to it then?

437
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,191
What if I ask you
to give it to my family?

438
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,519
Would you do it?

439
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,591
If I said yes...

440
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,352
would you believe me?

441
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,517
You wanna cut the cards?

442
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,840
No.

443
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,673
A king.

444
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,354
Two kings.

445
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,431
<i>Flynn White to the principal's office,
please.</i>

446
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,671
I'm sorry to pull you
out of class.

447
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,194
It's your aunt Marie.

448
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,039
It sounds very important.

449
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,838
You can take it in here, okay?
Okay.

450
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,639
Here he is.

451
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,080
Thank you.

452
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,038
Hey, Aunt Marie.

453
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,839
What's--? What's going on?

454
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,032
Hold on a sec, honey.

455
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,556
<i>Look at those numbers for Denver.</i>

456
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,077
<i>Things haven't gone their way.</i>

457
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,960
Son, it's me.
Please, don't let on.

458
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,079
<i>Carmen is nearby, right?
She cannot know.</i>

459
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,677
<i>Son, are you there?</i>

460
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,115
Yes.

461
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,955
It's so good to hear your voice.

462
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,597
I, uh...

463
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,350
Son, the things that they're saying

464
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,591
<i>about me.</i>

465
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,073
<i>I did wrong.
I made some terrible mistakes.</i>

466
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,473
But the reasons were always...

467
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,316
Things happened
that I never intended.

468
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,274
I never intended--

469
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,796
Listen, son, we don't have much time.

470
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,477
Is Louis' family still
at 4848 Newcombe?

471
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,077
<i>Son, your friend, Louis Corbett,</i>

472
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,200
<i>does his family still live
in that same place up on Newcombe?</i>

473
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,154
Yes.
<i>Okay, good.</i>

474
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,599
Okay, he's a good kid.
He's like you. He'll understand.

475
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,554
<i>I'm sending Louis a package.</i>

476
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,754
<i>Now, it's addressed to Louis,
but it's for you,</i>

477
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,594
<i>your mother and your sister.</i>

478
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,078
There's money inside.

479
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:00,793
About $100,000. Okay?

480
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,679
I think.

481
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,038
<i>It was all that I could fit into the box.</i>

482
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,754
<i>It has to be a secret.</i>

483
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,391
If anyone says a word,
the police will take it.

484
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,839
<i>I wanted to give you so much more.</i>

485
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,477
<i>But this is all I could do.</i>

486
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,751
Do you understand?

487
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,794
Son?

488
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,673
Can you hear me?
Do you understand?

489
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,629
You want to send money?

490
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,632
Yes. Good.

491
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,757
Good, good.

492
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,429
So you'll talk to Louis, right?

493
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,990
You killed Uncle Hank.

494
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,278
You killed him!
Listen. Wait. Wait, son.

495
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,831
No. What you did to Mom-- You asshole.
<i>Please--</i>

496
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,320
You killed Uncle Hank.

497
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,032
Listen to me. You've got to listen to me.
Just shut up. Just stop it. Stop it.

498
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,271
<i>I don't want anything from you.</i>

499
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,352
I don't give a shit.

500
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,591
You need this money.
<i>You killed Uncle Hank.</i>

501
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,956
<i>You killed him!</i>
Your mother needs this money.

502
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,430
It can't all be for nothing.
<i>What you did--</i>

503
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,035
Please. Please.
<i>Just shut up. Shut up.</i>

504
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,396
<i>Will you just--? Just leave us alone.</i>

505
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,550
You asshole!

506
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,395
Why are you still alive?

507
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,394
<i>Why won't you just die already?</i>
Please--

508
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,710
Just-- Just die.

509
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,390
<i>Wagner hasn't had to be
really stellar tonight.</i>

510
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,359
<i>Made solid saves
back in the first period.</i>

511
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,231
<i>You know, Michael, that's probably--
Going back, look at Wagner's numbers,</i>

512
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,474
<i>you know, it seems like he's one
of the last goalies in the league.</i>

513
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,320
<i>They don't wanna
put pressure on this guy.</i>

514
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,240
<i>Kevin Granato looks to make a move,
had the puck taken.</i>

515
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,278
<i>Denver comes back out
the other way.</i>

516
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,831
<i>--by Graham Melanson off Rycroft.
Who else?</i>

517
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,118
<i>Boy, he's been all over the ice tonight.</i>

518
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,677
<i>DEA, Albuquerque District Office.</i>

519
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,559
<i>How may I direct your call?</i>

520
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,272
I'd like to speak to the agent

521
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,911
in charge of the Walter White
investigation.

522
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,831
<i>Who may I say is calling?</i>

523
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,553
Walter White.

524
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,991
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

525
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,632
<i>Sir? Sir, are you still there?</i>

526
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,799
<i>--this is notjust a goalie that's out there,
it's a whole team.</i>

527
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,475
<i>Two forty-nine remaining
in the third period.</i>

528
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,836
You ready for that drink now?

529
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,590
Dimple Pinch. Neat.

530
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,315
You got it.

531
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,150
<i>--and Melanson,
with a good look, makes the save.</i>

532
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,437
<i>That's why you need good, solid
breakout passes.</i>

533
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,077
<i>Matt Peterson-- Win the draw, Englehart
wins the draw, back to Peterson,</i>

534
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,069
<i>goes behind the net, makes a terrible
breakout pass, goes right to Hackard.</i>

535
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,392
<i>He just winds up, puts it on net here.
Turnovers, turnovers.</i>

536
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,871
<i>When you get turnovers
in the offensive zone, chances happen.</i>

537
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,793
<i>Hopefully it won't happen again.</i>

538
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,031
<i>Turnovers generally--</i>

539
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,355
<i>- I wasn't sure you'd come.
- I'm not staying--</i>

540
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,799
<i>- Is this transfer good on the--?
- Darker than a normal rosé--</i>

541
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,839
<i>For us, it's always been
science first, and--</i>

542
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,037
Wait, would you--? Would you--?

543
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,831
Would you go back,
please?

544
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,759
<i>- ShamWows--
- More of a by-product.</i>

545
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,990
There.
<i>Exactly.</i>

546
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,675
What, this?
Yes.

547
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,797
<i>Butjust yesterday, your charity,</i>

548
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,560
<i>the Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz
Foundation,</i>

549
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,191
<i>announced a $28 million grant</i>

550
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,354
<i>for drug-abuse treatment centers
throughout the Southwest.</i>

551
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,477
<i>Charlie, the Southwest is our home</i>

552
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,560
<i>and we couldn't just ignore
what's going on in our own backyard.</i>

553
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,157
<i>But I'm sure you're aware that there
are people who suggest other motives.</i>

554
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,717
<i>Andrew Ross Sorkin
of</i> The New York Times

555
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,031
<i>wrote a column suggesting</i>

556
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,553
<i>that the grant was
a kind of publicity maneuver</i>

557
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,191
<i>to shore up the stock price
of Gray Matter Technologies</i>

558
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,116
<i>because of your association
with Walter White.</i>

559
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,999
<i>That's not exactly the way--</i>

560
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,152
<i>To cleanse yourselves, so to speak,</i>

561
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:37,679
<i>of having a methamphetamine kingpin
as cofounder of your company.</i>

562
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,036
<i>Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up.</i>

563
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,352
<i>I have to believe that
the investing public understands</i>

564
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,792
<i>we're talking about a person
who was there early on,</i>

565
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,953
<i>but who had nothing to do
with the creation of the company</i>

566
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,589
<i>and still less to do with growing it.</i>

567
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,310
<i>So, what was Walter White's
contribution?</i>

568
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,030
<i>You know, to be honest... Honey?</i>

569
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,391
<i>The company name.
The company name.</i>

570
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,280
<i>We came up with it
by combining our names.</i>

571
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,635
<i>"Schwartz" means "black."</i>

572
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,237
<i>Black plus white makes gray.
Hence Gray Matter Technologies.</i>

573
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,189
<i>Exactly. As far as I can recall,
his contribution begins and ends there.</i>

574
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,273
<i>There are continuing reports
of blue methamphetamine,</i>

575
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,070
<i>considered his signature product,
throughout the Southwest</i>

576
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,597
<i>and some evidence
of reaching as far as Europe.</i>

577
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,277
<i>So my question is,
is Walter White still out there?</i>

578
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,472
<i>No, he's not.</i>

579
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,031
<i>You sound very sure.</i>

580
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,475
<i>I am.</i>

581
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,991
<i>I can't speak to this Heisenberg
that people refer to,</i>

582
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,511
<i>but whatever he became,</i>

583
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,593
<i>the sweet, kind, brilliant man</i>

584
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,039
<i>that we once knew long ago,
he's gone.</i>

585
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,669
<i>But to be absolutely clear...</i>

586
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,115
Police! Hands! Show us your hands.
Show us your hands.

587
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,760
What's going on?

588
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,152
Let's see your hands!
