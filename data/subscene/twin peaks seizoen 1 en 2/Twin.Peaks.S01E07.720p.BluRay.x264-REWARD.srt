1
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,190
Audrey, you're a high-school girl.

2
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,359
I'm an agent of the FBI.

3
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,196
So do you want me to leave or what?

4
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:01,495
What I want and what I need
are two different things, Audrey.

5
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,373
When a man joins the bureau,

6
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,835
he takes an oath
to uphold certain values.

7
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,170
Values that he's sworn to live by.

8
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,175
This is wrong, Audrey.
We both know it.

9
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,472
But don't you like me?

10
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,142
I like you very much.

11
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,645
You're beautiful,
intelligent, desirable.

12
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,690
You're everything that a man wants
in his life.

13
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,694
But what you need right now,
more than anything else, is a friend.

14
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,946
Someone who will listen.

15
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,839
Friends, huh?

16
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,805
Now, I'm gonna go down and get us
two malts and some fries downstairs.

17
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,057
Then I want you to tell me
all your troubles.

18
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,767
I could take all night.

19
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,396
The night is young.

20
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,943
Now, I'm gonna get the food,
and you're gonna get dressed.

21
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,988
I can't tell you all my secrets.

22
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,657
Secrets are dangerous things,
Audrey.

23
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,369
- Do you have any?
- No.

24
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,580
Laura had a lot of secrets.

25
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,168
Finding those out is my job.

26
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,948
Good morning, Officer Brennan.

27
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,661
I sure wish you would stop
calling me Officer Brennan.

28
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:11,667
Officer Andy, this is peak-activity time
at the station switchboard.

29
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,753
So it's really not convenient for me
to talk right now.

30
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,634
Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station,
may I help you?

31
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,303
One moment, please.

32
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,397
Dr. Stanicek?

33
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,190
Yes, it's me.

34
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,567
Good. I've got the tests...

35
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,446
Oh.

36
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,367
Uh-huh.

37
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:53,166
Well, thank you, doctor.

38
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,670
No, I'm fine.

39
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,256
Bye.

40
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,017
Morning, Lucy.
Heard you were out sick yesterday.

41
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,936
I'm much better today, thanks.

42
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,523
- We're on it.
- I found it, yeah.

43
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,485
"Gracula Religiosa,

44
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,739
commonly known as the hill myna.

45
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,659
Native to Southeast Asia, Indonesia.

46
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:32,122
Feeds on fruit mainly,
some invertebrates.

47
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,584
Its ability to mimic the human voice
is amazing."

48
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,253
Yeah, well, so far,
we haven't heard a peep.

49
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,630
Hey, Waldo, what's up?

50
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:46,094
Well, it says here that "mimicry
is a kind of play with the myna."

51
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:52,142
But this one's in a weakened condition.
Starved, dehydrated.

52
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,062
I'd say he's feeling anything
but playful.

53
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,607
Here you go, little fella.

54
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,318
Oh, you wanna feed him,
Agent Cooper?

55
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,362
I don't like birds.

56
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,073
When do you think
he'll start talking again?

57
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,911
Well, according to the book,
his urge to mimic should return

58
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,412
with his good health.

59
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,706
Well, if it does,
then we've got a witness.

60
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,377
Well, we better keep feeding him.

61
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,253
You got any apples?

62
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,756
Yeah, there's some
in the bottom of the fridge.

63
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,841
These grapes are right on the edge.

64
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,844
These just came in from your office.

65
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,807
Ah, forensics confirm
Mr. Jacques Renault

66
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,850
had three guests to his cabin.

67
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:37,145
Laura Palmer, Ronette Pulaski
and Leo Johnson.

68
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,275
That was the only exposed negative
on that roll of film, Harry.

69
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,152
Look familiar?

70
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,446
That's our Waldo.

71
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,491
No, Harry, the girl. That's Laura.

72
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,288
Well, now we know who and when.

73
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,457
We don't know why.

74
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,878
Voice activated, Harry.

75
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,967
When the bird talks,
maybe we'll get some answers.

76
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,304
Albert confirmed that this matches
the fragment

77
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,140
found in Laura's stomach.

78
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,350
Thousand-dollar chip
from One-Eyed Jack's.

79
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,186
Jacques Renault's working there.
He's dealing in the casino.

80
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,856
Well, I think a little fieldwork
is in order.

81
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,400
Jack's is over the border,
little out of our jurisdiction.

82
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,402
Well, I know that, Harry.

83
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,198
That's why I was thinking this would be
a good job for the Bookhouse Boys.

84
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,843
Better call Hawk on that one.

85
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,973
Shelly.

86
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,562
Bobby Briggs.

87
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,698
Come on, lover boy. Leo's waiting.

88
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,578
I called you, but your dad answered.
I didn't know what to say.

89
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,539
Bobby's here, baby. Bobby's here.

90
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,548
I shot him, Bobby.

91
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,134
I know I did.

92
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:37,098
He just screamed and screamed.
He sounded like an animal.

93
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,434
You what?

94
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,063
Oh, slow down, Shelly. Talk to me.

95
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,398
He's out there, I know he is.

96
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,025
He's gonna kill me.

97
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,820
- Bobby, he's gonna kill me.
- Shelly, Shelly.

98
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,742
Start over. Go real slow.

99
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,624
Leo came home late last night.

100
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,919
He was all beaten up.
He had blood all over him.

101
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:11,883
I told him I was never ever
gonna let him hurt me again.

102
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:16,888
But he came at me,
so I pulled the trigger.

103
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,269
I shot him, Bobby.

104
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,565
What am I gonna do?
Where am I gonna hide?

105
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:32,112
Shelly, Leo Johnson is history,
understand?

106
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,574
I'm taking care of you from now on.

107
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,160
I'm gonna deal with Leo.
I'm gonna deal with James.

108
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,912
Bobby's gonna deal with everything.

109
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,428
Birdseed? No, this bird eats fruit.

110
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,389
The sheriff says it's a witness.

111
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,225
No, not just because
it saw something, because it talks.

112
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,811
And it needs to eat...

113
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,213
What's up, doc? Heh.

114
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,925
Just a few words
before I go to sleep.

115
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,388
I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.

116
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,683
Big bad ones, you know?

117
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,187
The kind you like.

118
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,819
It's easier talking into the recorder.

119
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,282
I guess I feel I can say anything.

120
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,160
All my secrets.

121
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,829
The naked ones.

122
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,874
I know you like those, doc.

123
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,002
I know you like me too.

124
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,714
That will be my little secret, okay?

125
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,676
Just like your coconut.

126
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,307
Why is it so easy
to make men like me?

127
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,894
And I don't even have to try
very hard.

128
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:33,858
Or maybe, if it was harder...

129
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,197
This one's empty.

130
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,953
"February 23rd."
The night Laura died.

131
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,711
- Tape's not in there.
- He must still have it.

132
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,213
I mean, she died.
He never returned it.

133
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,299
God, do you think Dr. Jacoby
killed her?

134
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,721
We're gonna find that tape tonight.

135
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,681
Where?

136
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,100
Jacoby's office.

137
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,227
What if he's there?

138
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,396
We'll get him out.

139
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,357
How?

140
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:19,654
Maybe he gets a phone call
from Laura.

141
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,787
What's up, doc?

142
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,208
Just a few words
before I go to sleep.

143
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,211
I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.

144
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:46,181
Here, try this. It smells like a florist.

145
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,977
This won't do.
I want something more fruity.

146
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,353
Fruity.

147
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,314
- As in fruit.
- Jenny.

148
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,066
Could I see you in my office
in five minutes?

149
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,110
Sure. Yeah.

150
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,862
I'm not making myself clear.

151
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,198
I want a scent
that makes a statement.

152
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,659
Maybe you should try hanging it
around your neck.

153
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,370
It's a perfume,
it's a fashion accessory.

154
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,956
Two statements for the price of one.

155
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,084
I don't appreciate your attitude.

156
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,507
Well, thank you for shopping
Horne's Department Store.

157
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,683
I'm gonna use the little girls' room.

158
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,435
Okay.

159
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,239
You know,
there's a real bad accident outside.

160
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,200
It sounded like a bus or something.

161
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,054
Come right this way, Jenny.

162
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:15,854
Something really special
to talk about today.

163
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,732
Come right in.
My, my, you look lovely.

164
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,401
Sit, sit.

165
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,695
Thank you, Mr. Battis.

166
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,406
This is for you, Jenny.

167
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,742
A reward for a job well done.

168
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,886
It's a unicorn,
ancient symbol of purity.

169
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,930
Tamed only by the young at heart.

170
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,100
Wow, a unicorn.

171
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,562
Jenny, you had a good time
at the club last week, didn't you?

172
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,107
Yeah, yeah,
I had a great time, Mr. Battis.

173
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,444
They were very pleased with you
as well, I must say.

174
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,195
They'd like you to continue.

175
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,032
And believe me, Jenny,
not many girls qualify.

176
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,910
- Really?
- Yes.

177
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,330
Now, the variety of work
is completely up to you.

178
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,458
Hostess, cocktail waitress.

179
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:23,755
Or if you are chosen, hospitality girl.

180
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,299
What's that?

181
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:35,224
Hospitality girls
escort important guests, VIPs.

182
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,478
It's a lucrative opportunity, Jenny.

183
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:43,149
Attending to wealthy men
in need of a little company.

184
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,361
That sounds cool,
as long as they're wealthy.

185
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:52,367
Jenny, your attitude
will take you far in this life.

186
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:56,204
Call this number,
ask for Black Rose.

187
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,247
Now why don't we make a trip
to Eveningwear

188
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,333
and find you something elegant?

189
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,669
Elegant sounds great, Mr. Battis.

190
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,420
Elegant.

191
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,881
How do you feel about rose?

192
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,402
"Ronette Pulaski."

193
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,128
You're in prison,
you remember faces from home.

194
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,047
They all seem like friends somehow,
even the ones you barely knew.

195
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,842
It's like something to hang on to,
I guess.

196
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,469
Must have been hard on you.

197
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,972
I paid my debt. That's what counts.

198
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,558
You know, you're a really big help
around here.

199
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,478
I wanna thank you for that,
for getting Norma through.

200
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,981
You're welcome, Hank.
It's no problem.

201
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,734
She told me in her letters
how much you've meant,

202
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,861
and how much Pete helped...

203
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,320
Pete?

204
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,573
Yeah, no, not Pete. Um...

205
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,907
Oh, no, you mean Ed.

206
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,243
- Yeah, Big Ed.
- Yeah.

207
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,745
Yeah, I'm a little better at faces

208
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,038
- than names, I guess.
- Oh.

209
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,880
Yeah, Big Ed.

210
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,632
Hello there.

211
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,102
Shelly, can we have another cup here?

212
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,981
Hello, Hank.

213
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,942
Hi, Harry. Glad to see me?

214
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,237
You, uh...
You looking for a free lunch,

215
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,824
I recommend the meatloaf.

216
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,160
Well, save it. I'm looking for you.

217
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,789
- Harry, I'm innocent.
- What you are is on parole, Hank.

218
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:07,168
That means you pay your case officer
a visit once a week, Fridays.

219
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,171
You miss a visit, go to jail. Got it?

220
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,840
Thanks for the reminder, sheriff.

221
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,301
Stop in anytime.

222
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,098
Do you think people really change,
Cooper?

223
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,766
I don't.

224
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,018
Oh, afternoon, guys.

225
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,396
- You like some coffee?
- Afternoon, Shelly. Yes.

226
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,273
We should be on our way.

227
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,446
Harry, I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

228
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:40,660
Every day, once a day,
give yourself a present.

229
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:46,249
Don't plan it, don't wait for it,
just let it happen.

230
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,292
It could be a new shirt
at the men's store,

231
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,128
a catnap in your office chair,

232
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:56,467
or two cups of good hot black coffee,
like this.

233
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,595
A present. Like Christmas?

234
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,180
Yeah.

235
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:12,400
Oh. Man, that hits the spot.

236
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,698
Nothing like a great cup
of black coffee.

237
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,743
Bye, Audrey.

238
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,745
So did Battis get you a dress?

239
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,372
Yeah, he did.

240
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,958
Got mine yesterday. I'm gonna be
working hostess this weekend.

241
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,126
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

242
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,128
- Cool.
- Got one of these too.

243
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,297
Yeah, what am I gonna do
with a horned horse?

244
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,966
Ha, ha. Ditto.
I bet he's got cartons of them.

245
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,552
He probably does.

246
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,429
God, Jenny,
I did a really dumb thing.

247
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,056
Um, I lost that number
that he gave me for Black Rose.

248
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,808
Do you have it?

249
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,603
Yeah, I got it.

250
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,354
Great.

251
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,735
Here.

252
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,698
Thanks.

253
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,285
- Okay, I'll talk to you later.
- Okay, see you tomorrow.

254
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,425
I wasn't fooling, Montana.

255
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,470
You show them, Chet.

256
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,765
You show all of them.

257
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:36,484
Tune in tomorrow for Invitation To Love.

258
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,823
Ed.

259
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,827
I'm eating bonbons.

260
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,211
Come on, honey, it's not that bad.

261
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,964
You don't know how bad it is.

262
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:03,261
You don't know all the things
I was gonna do for us.

263
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,179
I know.

264
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,849
A new TV, I was gonna do that.

265
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,185
I already looked at a motorboat.

266
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,145
Sweetheart.

267
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,733
It wasn't just things I was gonna buy.

268
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,070
It was a new life
we were gonna lead.

269
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,990
Nadine,
there's plenty of patent attorneys.

270
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,992
We just got to keep on looking
till we find one

271
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,952
that understands drape runners.

272
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,329
Rejected.

273
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,499
Rejected. That's what he said.

274
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,085
Nobody else
is gonna say anything different.

275
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:40,381
Nadine, don't you give up.
Don't you dare.

276
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,851
I just got that baby back
from Tim and Tom's Taxidermy.

277
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,857
When I caught him, he was this big.

278
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:03,529
But I guess by the time they take
the innards out and put the stuffing in,

279
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,741
it loses something in the translation.

280
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,493
Yeah, well, Pete,
it's still a fine-looking trophy,

281
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,871
no matter what the size.

282
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:17,251
Yeah, well, size isn't everything,
I guess.

283
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:22,048
Harry. I didn't expect you to be here.

284
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:27,386
I'm late for the mill,
but I'll make time for us.

285
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,764
What's wrong?

286
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,225
What were you doing
at the Timber Falls Motel, Tuesday?

287
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,769
Oh.

288
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,146
Tuesday I was at the mill.

289
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,900
Hawk saw you.
I know you were there.

290
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,319
Oh.

291
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,364
Harry.

292
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,325
You can tell me anything.

293
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,161
Josie, you can tell me anything.

294
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,955
I was there

295
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,377
because Ben and Catherine
were there together.

296
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:04,090
I followed them and I took pictures.

297
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,813
What's this all about?

298
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,691
You asked me for proof last time.

299
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,612
And I followed them
and I took pictures.

300
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:33,244
The other night I heard
Catherine talking on the phone.

301
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,539
Something about an accident.

302
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:40,793
A fire. A fire at the mill.

303
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,172
A fire at Andrew's mill.

304
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,133
My mill.

305
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:53,722
I'm not gonna let this happen. No.

306
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,478
Neither will I.

307
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,522
I won't let it happen.

308
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,458
Well, now.

309
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,711
Evening, Harry, Ed. You all set?

310
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,214
- Is that what you're wearing?
- It's pretty spiffy, Cooper.

311
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,216
Do you like to gamble, Ed?

312
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,012
Well, I went to Reno once.
But I never felt too lucky.

313
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,139
Well, you're gonna be lucky tonight.

314
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,020
It's $10,000 of the bureau's money.

315
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,190
When I gamble
with a company stake,

316
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,525
I always like to bring back
a 10 to 15 percent return.

317
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,611
How much you wanna start with?

318
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,363
How about 300?

319
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,992
And, Ed, the suit is perfect.

320
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,079
Well,
Harry would like to talk with you.

321
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,124
So why don't I see you outside?

322
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,129
Yeah, Harry, what's on your mind?

323
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,550
I'm worried about Josie.
She's been real afraid.

324
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,093
About what?

325
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,262
Ben Horne and Catherine Martell.

326
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,515
Now, they've been seeing
each other on the side.

327
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,518
It's been going on for years.
Josie just found out.

328
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,355
She thinks that they're planning
to burn down the sawmill

329
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,900
and somehow get rid of her too.

330
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,818
Do you believe her?

331
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:33,197
I know Ben Horne wants that land
for the Ghostwood Development,

332
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,909
and I know Josie won't sell.
Yeah, yeah, I believe her.

333
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,994
How much do you know about her?

334
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,956
Where she's from?
Who she was before?

335
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,583
- What you getting at?
- The truth, Harry.

336
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,794
- That's my job.
- I know all I need to know.

337
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,088
I love her, and she's in trouble.

338
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,717
That's good enough for me.
Let's look into it.

339
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,011
Thanks.

340
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,390
- Is Hawk ready?
- Yeah, he's outside in the van.

341
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,934
Oh.

342
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,936
I got that brand-new Cadillac
you wanted.

343
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,063
Good. It's perfect for our cover.

344
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,107
High rollers from the Tri-Cities.

345
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,442
Oral surgeons, Harry.

346
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,321
Big spenders
vacationing among the firs.

347
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,381
Yeah,
has Agent Cooper returned yet?

348
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:37,094
I need to leave another message.
Tell him that Audrey called again.

349
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,930
Yes, it's still urgent.

350
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,061
I'm glad you agreed to see me,
Mrs. Martell.

351
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,229
It's quite all right.

352
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,440
Normally,
I'd never think to impose this late.

353
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,775
That's fine. Now what's this about?

354
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,361
Every agent is instructed
five signatures.

355
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:58,699
It's really the first thing we learn,
and somehow we missed one.

356
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,910
Now, refresh my memory.
What policy is this?

357
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,746
Your new life insurance.

358
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,873
Since the binder takes effect
at midnight tonight,

359
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,043
I really had no choice, see.
Just couldn't wait until tomorrow.

360
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,838
Right here, please.

361
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,970
Is everything in order, Mrs. Martell?

362
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,891
Yes. It's just...

363
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,273
This was handled without
our actually meeting each other.

364
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,651
And I... I'd almost forgotten.

365
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,445
To be perfectly honest with you,
Mrs. Martell,

366
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,781
I withheld that last page myself.

367
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Did you?

368
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,661
Have to admit
I thought it a little unusual.

369
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,539
Life insurance and the client
is too busy to be involved?

370
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:51,126
I mean, you did know about this policy,
didn't you?

371
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,711
Are you suggesting

372
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:56,548
that there's something irregular
at work here?

373
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,134
I certainly never got that idea
from Mrs. Packard, no.

374
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,428
Or from Mr. Horne,
for that matter, either.

375
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,390
When he offered to collect
your signatures, I thought it was fine.

376
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:10,896
Just, with a new account
I like to be certain to cross every T.

377
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,606
Right here, please.

378
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:18,904
You know, I'm noticing
that there are some minor changes

379
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:23,826
that I asked my attorney to make
that are not included in this draft.

380
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,411
I think what I'd like to do

381
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,663
is go over this with him
on the phone in the morning

382
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,416
and initial the changes

383
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,585
and get the completed documents
to you at that time.

384
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:39,717
If there's anything that I can do
to help you with the policy

385
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,512
or anything at all, anything.

386
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,015
Are you an ambitious man,
Mr. Neff?

387
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,435
One likes to think so.

388
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,645
One never knows.

389
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:55,441
There may be a few T's left to cross.

390
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,985
Good night.

391
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,070
Mrs. Martell.

392
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,450
I'll see myself out.

393
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,382
Think.

394
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,838
Ed, why don't you open that up?

395
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,468
Wow, look at all this.

396
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,386
Ow.

397
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,222
I'm sorry.

398
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:14,061
There's a curly-haired wig in there, Ed.
It's gonna work like gangbusters.

399
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,231
And I'll help you out
with one of those mustaches.

400
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,691
Do you think it will fit?
I got a big head.

401
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,027
Okay, give it a try.

402
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,655
Testing, one, two.

403
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,549
Laura, Laura.

404
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:29,219
- What happened?
- Somebody shot Waldo.

405
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,597
Aw, Jesus.

406
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,434
Poor Waldo.

407
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,316
What happened?

408
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,151
Somebody shot Waldo.

409
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,032
Birdy, birdy, birdy.

410
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,243
Want some orange? Come on.
Let's share.

411
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,249
Hello, Waldo.

412
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:08,842
Laura, Laura.

413
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,178
Don't go there.

414
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:19,603
Hurting me. Hurting me.

415
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,982
Stop it. Stop it.

416
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,111
Stop it.

417
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:34,493
Leo, no. Leo, no.

418
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,265
Casino's probably in the back.

419
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,851
If Jacques' dealing,
that's where we'll find him.

420
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,229
Well, I'll give you the high sign
and clear out.

421
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,858
Here comes something.

422
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,112
Evening, fellas.
They call me Blackie.

423
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,532
Glad to know you, Blackie.
I like your style.

424
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,993
Most do. First time here?

425
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,869
Yeah, it's our rookie season.

426
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,622
Well, you just think
of tonight as spring training.

427
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,750
With a little luck,
you just might make the team.

428
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:28,380
- You look like a cop.
- I'm the cop.

429
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:34,011
You look like Cary Grant.
Got a name?

430
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,639
Barney and Fred.
Just in from the Tri-Cities.

431
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,434
Well, Fred, what's your line?

432
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,269
Own a gas station.

433
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,731
Um, I'm an oral surgeon.

434
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:50,736
Well, I got a Chevy parked out back
with a serious root-canal problem.

435
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,487
Want to take a look?

436
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,740
Well, I was hoping you might need
a little gum work,

437
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,367
because I'd sure like to get
a look under your hood.

438
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,661
Mm, Fred's okay.

439
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,580
Fred's a prince.

440
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,582
So, boys, what's your pleasure?

441
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,252
- Cards and dice.
- For starters.

442
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,337
Casino's that way.

443
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,966
- This might just be your lucky night.
- Luck has nothing to do with it.

444
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,597
Not bad, Ed. Not bad at all.

445
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,692
Hawk, we have a small casino room

446
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,862
with the usual games of chance.

447
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,115
Bar's at the far end and
there's stairs to who knows where.

448
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,534
Everybody's having a good time.

449
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,120
No sign of Jacques Renault.

450
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,414
Ed's gonna head over
to the craps table.

451
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,583
I'm gonna play some blackjack.

452
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,460
Ed,

453
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,462
let's gamble.

454
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:35,525
You simply have got to teach me
some of these incredible songs.

455
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,902
Incredible, eh?

456
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,069
Incredible.

457
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,238
Jerry, maybe you'd like to take
some of our guests

458
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,781
down to the dining room.

459
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,538
I'll be with you in a half a tick.

460
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,628
You should have seen them
at this tour of the site.

461
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,087
- The trees, Ben.
- Jerry.

462
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,881
- They worship them.
- Jerry.

463
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,925
I caught a couple of them
hugging pine.

464
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,092
- Jerry.
- No kidding.

465
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,637
When are they
signing the contracts?

466
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,264
This needs more pecan.
They're ready, Ben.

467
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,141
They're poised
with their pen in their hand.

468
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,809
Mm-hm.

469
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,144
Yeah?

470
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,147
- So, what's the catch?
- More fun.

471
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,440
Signing party.

472
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,068
They want to finalize the deal
at One-Eyed Jack's.

473
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,697
How did they find out about Jack's?

474
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,744
I take full responsibility.

475
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,538
Uh-huh. Jerry, Jerry.

476
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,208
Get them back on the van.

477
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:40,632
Heh. Okay, everybody,
back in the van!

478
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,510
Road trip! Road trip!

479
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,679
- Hey, going on a road trip.
- Road trip.

480
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,180
- Road trip.
- Road trip.

481
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,140
Road trip.

482
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,400
- Ahem.
- Hello.

483
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,277
Is she there?

484
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,697
I just came back. She's gone.

485
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,241
We need her at the mill.

486
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,826
I'll get her there.

487
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,079
- Is it set for tonight?
- Yes.

488
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,999
You shouldn't call here for a while.

489
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,543
I know the drill.

490
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,614
You're not a shy one, are you,
sweetheart?

491
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,992
I'm not shy.

492
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,091
Hester Prynne.

493
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,926
Pretty name.

494
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,763
Maple House in Vancouver.

495
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,515
Roy's in Chicago.

496
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,353
Calgary Stampede, '87 through '89.

497
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,855
Where did you work in Calgary,
darling?

498
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,273
Around.

499
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,067
Can you give me a name?

500
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,111
The Lost Dude Ranch.

501
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,574
Big Amos still running things
out there?

502
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,577
Mm. Bigger and better.

503
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,209
Big Amos is the name of my dog.

504
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,170
I read The Scarlet Letter
in high school just like you did.

505
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,797
Give me one good reason

506
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:47,175
why I shouldn't airmail
your bottom back to civilization.

507
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,602
Sign here.

508
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,105
Welcome to One-Eyed Jack's,
Hester.

509
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,655
Twenty-one again. Another winner.

510
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,827
- How did you do?
- Do I have to pay you back?

511
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,705
We'll take it out of my winnings.

512
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,583
- Care to sit in?
- Blackjack is not my game.

513
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,002
- Ed, can you count to ten?
- On a good night.

514
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,379
Then you can win at blackjack.

515
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,677
Gentlemen, place your bets.

516
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,476
- Jacques, is it?
- That's me.

517
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:25,023
Jade. Here's to old times.

518
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,109
Should old acquaintance be forgot?

519
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,410
Come on, baby. Bottoms up.

520
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,704
One for the road.
For old times' sake.

521
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:40,872
Aloha.

522
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:48,087
Hey, what's up, doc?

523
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:52,926
Feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.
Big bad ones.

524
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,511
You know?

525
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,137
The kind you like.

526
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,598
Who is this?

527
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,518
Who do you think it is, silly?

528
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,686
I want to see you.

529
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,357
- You're not Laura.
- Okay, doc.

530
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,737
First thing you have to do
is go to the door.

531
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,990
Go on.

532
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,452
There's something waiting for you.

533
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:13,881
It's today's paper, doc.
Now do you believe me?

534
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:18,428
Meet me at Sparkwood and 21.

535
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,305
In ten minutes.

536
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,726
But wait...

537
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,400
You think he bought it?

538
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,778
I think so.

539
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,281
I think he did.

540
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,160
Okay. Wait here for us.

541
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,221
Gazebo.

542
00:45:42,489 --> 00:46:57,396
Say goodbye, James.
