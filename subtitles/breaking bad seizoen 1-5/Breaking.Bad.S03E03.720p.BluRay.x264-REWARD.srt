1
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:14,138
More.

2
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,190
Another.

3
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:27,735
Careful, señor.

4
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,321
Hot day like today...

5
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,657
...too much oil in the machine...

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,368
...can cause it to blow a gasket.

7
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:40,415
There are two kinds of men
in this world.

8
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,250
Those who drink...

9
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,335
...and those who pour.

10
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,505
Shut up and fill my glass.

11
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,934
Hey, you two.

12
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,561
Yes, you.

13
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,272
I used to be just like you.

14
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:07,859
Worked dirt for the man
till my hands bled.

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,736
But no more.

16
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:14,365
Because I learned that a man
can never drink his fill...

17
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,617
...by waiting in line for the tap.

18
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,369
Listen to him.

19
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,289
He can teach you something!

20
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,961
Hey, how you doing, boss?

21
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,134
Good to see you, my friend.

22
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:37,472
You know, I never pegged you
for such a deep thinker.

23
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,807
I keep thinking I should write a book.

24
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,059
Maybe, maybe...

25
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,317
So, what brings you to this
burro's asshole of a town?

26
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,778
I knew I would find you here.

27
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,741
Don't you have something to deliver?

28
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,910
Cutting it close, aren't you?

29
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,663
Lots of time.

30
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:08,169
Tortuga may be slow out of the gate,
but he always...

31
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,629
Finishes first.

32
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,089
Yes, I know.
Just like your namesake.

33
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:15,593
I like the way you talk, Tortuga.

34
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,512
Yeah?

35
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,181
You've got such a way with words.

36
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,519
They flow like a waterfall.

37
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,437
I like that about you.

38
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,656
I'm so stupid.
I missed your birthday.

39
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,783
No, I feel terrible.

40
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:42,495
So bad I came all the way here
to this burro's asshole...

41
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,288
...to give you your present.

42
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,540
Present?

43
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,626
Come on, boss.
No need to go through the trouble.

44
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,045
Forget it, I wanted to.

45
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,131
I have it for you in the back.

46
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,053
- Back there?
- Yes. Come. Follow me.

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,152
It's perfect!

48
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,071
Do you really like it?

49
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,033
I love it!

50
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,411
What a great pet it will make.

51
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,912
Thank you, boss!

52
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,539
Excellent.

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,166
Let me sign it for you.

54
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,877
Let me sign it...

55
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:38,092
..."For the big talker."

56
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,237
He's still breathing.

57
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,950
Well, by the looks of him,
he has no idea how close he came.

58
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,955
I'm assuming Saul Goodman
doesn't need to know.

59
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,166
Mum's the word.

60
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,208
Son of a bitch.

61
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,474
Hang on, baby.

62
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,654
Hello.

63
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,740
Walt? Are you in the house?

64
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,328
Oh, hey, Skyler. Yeah, it's me.

65
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,708
What? What the hell
are you doing in there?

66
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,418
I'm back.

67
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,212
No, no, you're not back, Walt.

68
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,090
You're not back.
Get... Get out of there.

69
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,551
- Well, it's my house too, Skyler.
- No...

70
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,596
I'm staying. End of story.

71
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,224
- We had an agreement.
- I didn't agree to anything.

72
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,561
Now, look, just come on inside
and we'll talk this through, okay?

73
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,606
No. No. There's nothing to talk about.

74
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:43,277
I am not coming in there
until you get out.

75
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,907
Well, suit yourself.

76
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,784
Walt.

77
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,452
Walt?

78
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,646
What is wrong with you?

79
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:23,234
- Skyler, I have every right to be here.
- No, you don't.

80
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,654
You don't live here anymore.
We're getting a divorce.

81
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,573
- I don't agree to a divorce.
- Well, it's not up to you.

82
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,955
If you don't get out of here right now,
I'm gonna call the police...

83
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,750
...and I'm going to tell them
everything.

84
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,586
I mean it, Walt.

85
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,675
There's the phone.

86
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,862
It's ringing.

87
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,118
Albuquerque Police Department.

88
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,538
Operator number 314.
How may I help you?

89
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,710
Albuquerque Police Department.
How may I help you?

90
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:27,548
Yes, I want to report a disturbance,
please.

91
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,595
No, no, it's not...
It's not exactly, it's...

92
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,473
It's a domestic issue.

93
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,601
Okay.

94
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,731
They're connecting me.

95
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,319
Right hand to God, I will tell them.

96
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,030
Do what you have to do, Skyler.

97
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,576
This family is everything to me.

98
00:08:55,827 --> 00:09:00,414
- Without it, I have nothing to lose.
- Fine.

99
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,753
Yes. My name is Skyler White.

100
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,923
I need police assistance
at my home right away.

101
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,762
My soon-to-be-ex-husband
broke into my house...

102
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,557
...and I need an officer to come
and remove him.

103
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,562
It's 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

104
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,776
Okay. Okay.

105
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,613
Thank you.

106
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,037
They're coming.

107
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,171
- Dad's here?
- Great, he's home.

108
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,507
- Dad.
- Hey, son.

109
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,467
How are you?

110
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,637
Are you back for good?

111
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:43,475
- Why are you home so soon?
- I'm not.

112
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,604
Hey, I am starving.
How about a grilled cheese?

113
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,023
- Sure.
- You want one too?

114
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,359
Walter, your dad and I
have something we need to discuss.

115
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,030
When your sandwich is ready,
I'll bring it to your room.

116
00:10:56,281 --> 00:11:01,368
Mom, can't it wait?
I haven't seen Dad in, like, forever.

117
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,120
- Walter?
- How was school?

118
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,039
- It was good.
- Yeah? Homework?

119
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,500
- No, not really.
- Not really? What does that mean?

120
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,679
So are you gonna be
at work tomorrow?

121
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,057
Yeah, that's the plan.

122
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,698
Hello, ma'am.
We were called about a disturbance?

123
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:44,078
It's more of a trespassing situation,
really, but...

124
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,705
Yeah, that was me.

125
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,335
You called the cops on Dad?

126
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,258
I came home from work
and he was back.

127
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,761
He had just moved back
into the house.

128
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:07,226
And I asked him to leave,
but he won't listen. I just...

129
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:11,271
I want him out.
I want him out of the house.

130
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,942
Okay, Mrs. White, there's a couple
questions I need to ask you.

131
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,944
It's very important
you answer honestly.

132
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,114
- Did he strike you?
- No.

133
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,451
- Has he ever hit you?
- No. This is not about violence.

134
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,787
This is about trespassing.

135
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:31,750
- About him being here against my will.
- Okay. Trespassing.

136
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,546
- You're divorced, then?
- No, working on it.

137
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,383
- Right now, were separated.
- Legally separated?

138
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,969
There's not a court order,
if that's what you mean.

139
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:46,056
But we've been living apart
for almost two weeks, give or take.

140
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,810
I changed the locks.
Isn't that breaking and entering?

141
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,812
Whose name is on the title
to the house?

142
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,315
Both of us. It's jointly owned.

143
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,110
We can't arrest a man for breaking
into his own house.

144
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,779
Not without a court order
requiring he stays away.

145
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,823
Unless he's threatened you
or the kids.

146
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:08,996
No. Not physically.
But having him in the house is just...

147
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:14,084
It's not a good thing. Excuse me.

148
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,674
I got her, honey.
Come here. Here we go.

149
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:25,512
You hungry? You hungry?
Here we go.

150
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,098
That was it.

151
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:32,811
- I'm sorry, officer. Where were we?
- Disagreements.

152
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,648
Yes, well,
we've had our share of that.

153
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:42,196
I haven't... I haven't been
the most attentive husband lately.

154
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:49,161
Mrs. White, would this be easier
if we stepped outside for a minute?

155
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:58,837
No. Nope. I'm fine right here.

156
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,547
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

157
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,425
If you want him out of the house,
you'll have to help me.

158
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:07,179
Is it possible maybe he's broken
any laws that you know of?

159
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:11,558
Anything at all. Anything that
we could work with here, just tell me.

160
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,311
Even if it's just a suspicion,
I can work with that.

161
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,730
I'll get him out of the house for you.

162
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,899
What's your take on all this?

163
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,944
It's my mom's fault.

164
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:29,743
She won't even say what my dad did
and it's because he didn't do anything.

165
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,412
I don't know why
she's being this way.

166
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,876
My dad, he is a great guy.

167
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,755
Son, it's not your mom's fault.

168
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,049
Mrs. White.

169
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,555
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There's no legal basis...

170
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,516
...for us to remove your husband
from the house.

171
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,603
Next time you feel things
are getting out of control...

172
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:00,357
...you should call this number.
It's the family hotline.

173
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,776
I'd really look into
some counseling.

174
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,029
Best of luck to you folks.

175
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,865
Listen, thank you, officers.
We're sorry.

176
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,459
Why you gotta...?
Why you gotta do this to Dad?

177
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,714
Junior, wait, come on.
Don't blame your mother for this.

178
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,720
Sorry.

179
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,989
Welcome home.

180
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:36,036
He lives. Happy housewarming, kid.

181
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,622
- Don't look so glad to see me.
- Thanks.

182
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,668
Interesting decor. It's subtle.

183
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,171
The whole minimalist thing never
really blew my hair back, but hey.

184
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:51,885
So how are you doing?
Staying clean?

185
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,723
Good. I was kind of worried
that you were back to old habits...

186
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,184
...since I didn't hear from you,
you know.

187
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,729
You realize how stupid it is
to ignore your counsel's phone calls?

188
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,564
What if I was trying to warn you...

189
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,235
...that the DEA was gonna kick down
your door? What then?

190
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,488
Why don't you spare me the sermon
and get to why you're here?

191
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,740
Fair enough.
Remember the other day...

192
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:17,911
...when I brought up the idea of you
getting back in touch with your partner?

193
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,580
Well, I kind of wanted to
re-float that boat.

194
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,333
I'm not suggesting you
yourself get back to cooking.

195
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,335
I mean, you being in rehab and all.

196
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,214
I only want you to convince
the master chef to do his thing.

197
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,426
So, what do you say?

198
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,887
- Sure, man. Whatever.
- Okay. Whatever what?

199
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,515
I mean, you gonna call him?

200
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:42,853
I said I'll handle it.
Now, bounce, will you? Please?

201
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,896
Final thought.

202
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,860
Look at this place. You're house-poor,
you got no bankroll.

203
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:54,281
If you get the maestro cooking again,
I'll make it worth your while.

204
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,867
Call him.

205
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,792
If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:

206
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,001
"Do Not Call list."

207
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,796
However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.

208
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,111
Schrader.

209
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,614
Yes, sir. Yeah, what's up?

210
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,284
Yeah?

211
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,541
That's great news, sir. Thank you.

212
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,169
Yeah, yeah, absolutely,
you can bet on that.

213
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,171
Hey, listen, thanks again, sir...

214
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,675
...I really appreciate you stepping
to the plate. Thank you.

215
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,181
So you gonna keep me in suspense
or what? What's the good news?

216
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:47,644
Merkert called in a couple of favors.
El Paso wants me back.

217
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,981
Hey, man, congrats, man.
That's fantastic.

218
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,566
Thank you.

219
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,361
Hello.

220
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,870
Gentlemen. Welcome.

221
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,206
Thank you for coming.

222
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,709
Any difficulty at the border?

223
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:19,212
The day I can't get across the border
is the day I retire.

224
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,132
Please, come in.

225
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,052
I apologize that it's not
wheelchair accessible.

226
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,024
My apologies, Gustavo.

227
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,485
Of course,
you should have been advised.

228
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,739
It's your territory,
you had a right to bless the order.

229
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,240
But...

230
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:51,369
We had no reason to believe
the man was of concern to you.

231
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,039
Indeed, he is.

232
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,417
So you're in business with
this Heisenberg.

233
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,253
I don't know him by that name,
but yes.

234
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,422
I've made no secret of the fact that...

235
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,968
...I have always done business
with certain local manufacturers.

236
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:11,848
You and I,
we still make money together.

237
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,103
It's never affected our relationship.

238
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,608
Don Salamanca had
a nephew named Tuco.

239
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,235
Yes, I knew of him.

240
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,531
Then perhaps you know Salamanca
mentored him in the business.

241
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,785
Thought of Tuco as a son.

242
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:37,248
When Don Salamanca was no longer
able, Tuco took over for his uncle.

243
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,627
He was a key man in our
organization north of the border.

244
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:42,962
He was loyal.

245
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,799
This Heisenberg, Walter White...

246
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,551
...he was one of
Tuco's local suppliers.

247
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,804
Until he betrayed Tuco.

248
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:56,226
So now you see,
blood must be repaid by blood.

249
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,145
Tuco's cousins here...

250
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,022
...they have the right
to exact vengeance.

251
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,817
The Salamanca family, the cartel...

252
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,903
...everyone stands shoulder
to shoulder on this.

253
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:10,949
Don Salamanca.

254
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,118
Gentlemen.

255
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,620
I feel your loss deeply.

256
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,332
Please accept my condolences.

257
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:25,839
I have no issue with
your right to vengeance.

258
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,803
But I am presently engaged in
business with this man.

259
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,181
When our business is done...

260
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:40,186
...he will no longer be
of any concern to me.

261
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,774
Until then...

262
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,195
...I need him alive.

263
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,995
Excuse us.

264
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,054
I don't tell you how to
fry your chickens, Gustavo.

265
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,725
You should really leave matters
of my organization's politics to me.

266
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:22,353
Do I not run my own territory?

267
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,897
Of course you do.

268
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,149
And I will advise them to be patient.

269
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,652
But I recommend you finish your
business with the man quickly.

270
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,655
Or you risk losing
the good graces of the cartel.

271
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,908
That would not be wise.

272
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,538
And those boys inside...

273
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,333
...I cannot guarantee
that they will listen.

274
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,920
They are not like you and I.

275
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,906
If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:

276
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,115
"Do Not Call list."

277
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,743
However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.

278
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,466
If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:

279
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:34,717
"Do Not Call list."

280
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,595
However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.

281
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,934
If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you...

282
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,979
Sweetheart. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

283
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:32,525
It's okay. It's okay, my girl.

284
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:37,989
Yes, it's okay. It's okay.
Mama's got you.

285
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:43,745
I've got you. Yes. Yes.

286
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,458
Skyler? Want some help?

287
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,764
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

288
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,487
God...

289
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:38,549
- What do you mean? Against your will?
- Yes.

290
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,428
Very much against my will.
He just... He showed right back up.

291
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:46,766
And he doesn't want a divorce.
Won't even consider it.

292
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,895
I called the police on him.

293
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,439
I was so clo...

294
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,944
- So close to what?
- Nothing. Never mind.

295
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,574
Skyler, I can't advise you properly
if you don't give me all the facts.

296
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,120
Understand, I'm bound
by the attorney-client privilege...

297
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,455
...to keep everything you tell me
a secret.

298
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,917
I can't tell a soul
unless you authorize me to.

299
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,711
Even if it's something illegal?

300
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,589
Especially if it's illegal.

301
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:23,344
I'm your lawyer, not the police.
My job is to protect you.

302
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:35,440
My husband makes meth.

303
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,569
Methamphetamine.

304
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:45,575
- Your husband's a drug dealer?
- A manufacturer, technically.

305
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:50,746
They... They call them cooks.

306
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,249
I looked it up on the Internet.

307
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:57,295
This is my advice,
and you should take it:

308
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,173
Sue your husband for divorce
immediately.

309
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:03,968
Let me go to the police
and tell them what you just told me.

310
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,597
I'll go in ex parte to get a
restraining order from the court today.

311
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,350
If he comes anywhere near you and
your children, he'll go straight to jail.

312
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,270
No questions asked.
This is a no-brainer.

313
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,523
It's the best thing for you
and your family.

314
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,694
I can't.

315
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,406
I can't do it.

316
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:32,413
I don't want my son to find out
that his father is a criminal.

317
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,041
I just...

318
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:40,796
- I can't do that to him.
- In the end, it may not be up to you.

319
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,841
Drug dealers have a way
of getting caught.

320
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,013
Walt has lung cancer.

321
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,724
His treatment bought him some time.

322
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:55,061
But the doctors,
they all say that sooner or later...

323
00:30:56,522 --> 00:31:01,817
I can't see why
I should lay all this on my family...

324
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,153
...when things may...

325
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:10,243
...resolve themselves on their own...

326
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,830
...without anyone else knowing.

327
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:23,256
Man, did I lose a bet or something?

328
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,593
- What are we doing in this shithole?
- Relax, will you?

329
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,096
Relax? This is the kind of place
you get knifed.

330
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:33,766
- We should have went to Chili's, man.
- All right, already. Jesus.

331
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:38,354
Outback Steakhouse. It's not too late.
They got that Blooming Onion.

332
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,940
What's wrong with spicing things
up a little?

333
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:45,111
This spice looks like it's been through
a couple of guys already.

334
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,531
So when you headed back down
to El Paso?

335
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,952
You know. Between all the packing,
errands, getting the ducks in a row...

336
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,581
...maybe a week or two.
- Week or two?

337
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,250
Come on, man.
I'd be dying to get back in the action.

338
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,627
It's not like
there's nothing going on up here.

339
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,129
What are you talking about?

340
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:07,425
Ain't jack going on up here.
It's quiet as hell.

341
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,052
I'm gonna hit the head.

342
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:46,130
Those two over there.
I think they're holding.

343
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,344
Man, in this place,
the bartender's probably holding.

344
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,850
- All right.
- What you doing?

345
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,685
Calling A.P.D., what do you think?

346
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,146
Since when can't we handle
a couple dirtballs?

347
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,689
Come on, man. Courtesy call.

348
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,567
What if Vice is running
some kind of undercover op?

349
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,783
Screw it. It's your turn to pay.

350
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,653
- Where you going?
- Gotta take a leak.

351
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,364
Jesus, get yourself some Flomax.

352
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,168
Stand up.

353
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:17,430
You got a problem with us, bitch?

354
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,598
Your move.

355
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,462
DEA. Don't move.

356
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,804
Go out and tell my partner
to get his ass in here.

357
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,842
If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:

358
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,010
"Do Not Call list."

359
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,596
However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.

360
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,319
If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:

361
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,154
"Do Not Call..."

362
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:13,295
The number you have reached,
149-4985...

363
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:17,258
...in area code 505 is no longer...

364
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,400
Skyler.

365
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,863
Can we talk?

366
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,506
ASAC wants to see you.

367
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,842
And?

368
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,470
We were hanging back,
saw a deal go down.

369
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,347
I went outside to call it in.

370
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,516
You stayed to keep an eye
on the suspects.

371
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,935
That's when they attacked you.

372
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:42,194
What I didn't tell him is that
you left your gun under the seat...

373
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:45,030
...before you went back inside.

374
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:05,968
I've done a terrible thing.
But I did it for a good reason.

375
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,930
I did it for us.

376
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:17,813
That is college tuition
for Walter Jr...

377
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:22,192
...and Holly 18 years
down the road.

378
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,490
That is health insurance
for you and the kids.

379
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:35,456
For Junior's physical therapy,
his SAT tutor.

380
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,334
It's money for groceries...

381
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,379
...for gas...

382
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:47,551
...for birthdays
and graduation parties.

383
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:54,725
Skyler, that money is for this roof
over your head...

384
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,394
...the mortgage you aren't
gonna be able to afford...

385
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,272
...on a part-time bookkeeper's salary
when I'm gone.

386
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:04,359
- Walt, I...
- Please. Please.

387
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:14,286
This money, I didn't steal it.

388
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,372
It doesn't belong to anyone else.

389
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,625
I earned it.

390
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:25,798
The things I've done to earn it...

391
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,518
...the things that I've had to do...

392
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,815
...I've got to live with them.

393
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,531
Skyler...

394
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,828
...all that I've done...

395
00:40:55,995 --> 00:41:01,458
...all the sacrifices that I have
made for this family...

396
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:07,589
...all of it will be for nothing
if you don't accept what I've earned.

397
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:10,592
Please.

398
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:17,599
I'll be here
when you get home from work.

399
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,187
You can give me your answer then.

400
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,128
Hey, Sky.

401
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:49,024
- Hey, some coffee?
- Yeah.

402
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:53,445
That report's looking real good.
I like how it looks.

403
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,155
Good.

404
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,582
Are your kids home?

405
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:49,418
It's here! It's here!
Everybody, come on in! Look!

406
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,463
Hey, Mrs. White.

407
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:56,466
Hey, Louis.

408
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,720
Hey, thanks for having me
over for dinner.

409
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,097
Sure.

410
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:07,811
Hey, Skyler. I'm cooking dinner.

411
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:12,816
Pot roast. Could you?

412
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:35,130
So how was your day?

413
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,551
- Good.
- Good.

414
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:40,761
Excellent.

415
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:46,391
I hope you don't mind, I invited Louis
to stay for dinner tonight.

416
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,979
You know, as a thank-you for driving
Walter Jr. To school for us.

417
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,066
We've been kind of absent...

418
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:59,029
...but, I tell you,
Louis really pitched in.

419
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:10,082
Look, I just wanna say that I feel good
about our talk this morning...

420
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,710
...and I'm very eager
to hear what you're thinking about...

421
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,754
...about what we talked about.

422
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,715
But, you know,
whenever you're ready, of course.

423
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:30,227
Honesty is good. Don't you think?

424
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,043
I fucked Ted.

425
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:06,138
Boys, dinner.

426
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,808
- Iced tea?
- Yeah.

427
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,393
- Okay.
- Thank you.

428
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:12,978
- Louis?
- Yes, please.

429
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:14,646
All right.

430
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,609
I want you boys both
to eat your salad, okay?

431
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,905
- Okay.
- I know nobody likes salad...

432
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:25,824
...but it's good for you.

433
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,993
- Thanks, darling.
- Thank you.
