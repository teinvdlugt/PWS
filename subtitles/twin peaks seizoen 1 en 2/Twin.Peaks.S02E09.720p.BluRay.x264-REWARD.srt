1
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,821
The short answer is,

2
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,031
this is the work of the same ghoul
who killed Laura.

3
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,700
More fan mail.

4
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,744
The letter O
under Maddy's ring fingernail.

5
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,581
There were strands of fur
clutched in her right hand.

6
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,292
- What kind of fur?
- White fox.

7
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,587
The strands were laced with
formaldehyde. A dead animal, stuffed.

8
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:56,008
I'll make phone calls. Leland will know
how to get a hold of Maddy's family.

9
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,801
Harry, don't make any calls.

10
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,554
- I need 24 hours.
- For what?

11
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,181
To finish this.

12
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,891
Cooper.

13
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,645
In observation...

14
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,900
...I don't know where this is headed.

15
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,860
But the only one of us
with coordinates

16
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,654
for this destination and its hardware
is you.

17
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,823
Go on whatever vision quest
you require.

18
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:24,077
Stand on the rim of the volcano,
stand alone and do your dance.

19
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,080
Just find this beast
before he takes another bite.

20
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,088
God help me,
I don't know where to start.

21
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,050
You're on the path.
You don't need to know where it leads.

22
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,968
Just follow.

23
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,688
I thought you'd never get here.

24
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,400
I went for a ride this morning.

25
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,528
God, the engine sounded like
a thousand people singing.

26
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:02,074
- What were they singing about?
- What do you think?

27
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,535
Last night?
I could sing about last night.

28
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,913
I got something for you.

29
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,419
Open it.

30
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,883
Oh, James.

31
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,803
I didn't know what size to get.

32
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,014
And the girl at the jewelry store
had these really big hands.

33
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,476
But I'll bet...

34
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,937
Perfect.

35
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,981
James.

36
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,485
I just think we should
be together all the time.

37
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,778
Really?

38
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,947
If that's okay with you.

39
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,158
It's perfect. Heh.

40
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,380
Ew.

41
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,427
Whatever fowl
did you take these eggs from?

42
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,388
Are we saying we don't like it?

43
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,640
I'm afraid I'm gonna
run into a thumbtack.

44
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,521
Mother, can't you ever say
anything nice?

45
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,108
I've tried so hard.
I try so hard,

46
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,694
and nothing is good enough for you.

47
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,740
Let me correct myself. Nothing I do
is ever good enough for you.

48
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,285
Well, that's not true.
The menus are very presentable.

49
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,829
Oh, I'm joking.

50
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,999
Honestly,
let me make a suggestion.

51
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,545
If you wanna serve
a truly memorable omelet,

52
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:43,592
try white veal sausage
and morel mushrooms.

53
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,429
Thanks. I'll go pick the mushrooms.

54
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,948
What did you say?

55
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,576
Nothing.

56
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,787
Hello, Donna.

57
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,914
Hello, James.

58
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,916
What did you say?

59
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,378
- It's French.
- I know it is, tell me.

60
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,630
Donna, what's the big deal?

61
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,389
You know Mrs. Tremond?

62
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,100
- Miss who?
- Mrs. Tremond.

63
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,644
Her grandson does the magic tricks.
He told me this.

64
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,813
But it was Mr. Smith.

65
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:43,360
- Harold?
- He left a suicide note.

66
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,282
You know, it means,
"I am a lonely soul."

67
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,494
I have to find Agent Cooper.

68
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,666
Donna, what's going on?

69
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,209
Hey.

70
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,429
Mrs. Tremond's the one
who told me about Harold Smith.

71
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,306
She has a grandson
and he said this to me.

72
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,143
The same words that are in
Harold Smith's suicide note.

73
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,228
Maybe the boy
said the same thing to Harold.

74
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,939
No, Harold's world was in his words.

75
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,233
The suicide note has to be
a message.

76
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,527
It all leads back here.

77
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:32,242
She's pretty old. It might take a second
if her grandson isn't here.

78
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,999
- May I, uh, help you?
- Is Mrs. Tremond home?

79
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,126
I'm Mrs. Tremond.

80
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,420
It must have been your mother
I spoke to.

81
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,506
My mother?
She passed away three years ago.

82
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,966
I live here alone, honey.

83
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,137
No, she was here. I spoke to her.
And her grandson, he was here too.

84
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,014
But I have no children.

85
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,807
But he was here.
They both were.

86
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,476
Donna, we'd better go.

87
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,978
Donna?
Are you Donna Hayward?

88
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,398
- Yeah.
- Just a moment.

89
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,109
I've never seen her before in my life.

90
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,320
I thought you delivered meals here.

91
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,948
Uh, the morning after poor Harold
died, I found this in my mail.

92
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,742
I meant to turn it in.

93
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,202
It's for you.

94
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,040
Thank you.

95
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,546
- It's Harold's handwriting.
- Open it, Donna.

96
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,142
It's Laura's diary,
a page from her diary.

97
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,727
Read it.

98
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,732
"February 22nd.

99
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,527
Last night I had
the strangest dream.

100
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:52,072
I was in a red room
with a small man dressed in red

101
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,533
and an old man sitting in a chair.

102
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,201
I tried to talk to him.

103
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,080
I wanted to tell him who Bob is
because I thought he could help me.

104
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,250
My words came out slow and odd.

105
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,211
It was frustrating trying to talk.

106
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,381
I got up and walked to the old man.

107
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,718
Then I leaned over and whispered
the secret in his ear.

108
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,682
Somebody has to stop Bob.

109
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:23,270
Bob's only afraid of one man,
he told me once.

110
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,689
A man named Mike.

111
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,192
I wonder if this was Mike
in my dream.

112
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,363
Even if it was only a dream,
I hope he heard me.

113
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,658
No one in the real world
would believe me.

114
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,869
February 23rd.

115
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,205
Tonight is the night that I die.

116
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,543
I know I have to
because it's the only way

117
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,837
to keep Bob away from me.

118
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,923
The only way to tear him out
from inside.

119
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,635
I know he wants me,
I can feel his fire.

120
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,680
But if I die,
he can't hurt me anymore."

121
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,980
Laura and I had the same dream.

122
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,483
- That's impossible.
- Yes, it is.

123
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,489
Deputy, take Donna home.

124
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,908
I've got to see Gerard.

125
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,300
He's completely dehydrated.

126
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,386
His breathing is becoming
more difficult. He needs that drug.

127
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,847
Mike.
Mike, I need you to talk to me.

128
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,724
- Any longer could kill him.
- Mike.

129
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,317
Bob has killed again.

130
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,404
I need to know something.
I need you to help me.

131
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,576
Bob was in my dream, Laura Palmer
was in my dream, so were you.

132
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,704
And Laura dreamt about me
the night before she died.

133
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,331
The same dream that I had.

134
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,542
I need to unlock that.
I need... The answer is inside of me.

135
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:14,339
Bob and I,
when we were killing together,

136
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:18,510
there was this perfect relationship,

137
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,345
appetite,

138
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,180
satisfaction,

139
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,307
a golden circle.

140
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,476
A golden circle.

141
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,147
A ring.

142
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,649
My ring.

143
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,984
I gave my ring to the Giant.

144
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,154
He is known to us here.

145
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,614
Then he's real?

146
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,866
As real as I.

147
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,664
He can help you find Bob.

148
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,626
- How?
- You must ask him first.

149
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,586
How do I do that?

150
00:11:54,213 --> 00:12:00,176
Oh, you have all the clues you need.

151
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:06,766
The answer is not here, my friend.

152
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,854
The answer is here.

153
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,230
I don't understand.

154
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,527
So much responsibility.

155
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,766
I know about you.

156
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,854
That milk will cool down on you

157
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,191
but it's getting warmer now.

158
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,447
"Getting warmer now."

159
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,919
Box and tag everything
in these drawers. Everything.

160
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,214
Coop, we found his telephone records.
Look at this.

161
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,675
The night Laura died.
Telephone call Leland told us about.

162
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:26,054
Ben called her number
from this office.

163
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,722
White fox.

164
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,434
Yeah, white, dead and stuffed.
Maddy was here.

165
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,522
I think Ben killed her in this office,
then took her to the waterfall.

166
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:39,067
He killed Laura
and he killed Maddy.

167
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,277
Madeleine Ferguson died
the night before last

168
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,154
between 10 p.m. and midnight.

169
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,949
That fits. We didn't take Ben in
until after midnight.

170
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,326
That's as close as I can cut it.

171
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,579
Ben Horne's blood test.

172
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:04,175
A couple of minutes, I'll have this up
to code. Tweaking the sensors, mostly.

173
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,553
Don't want your sprinklers
to be overly jumpy.

174
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,471
Gotta set it just so.

175
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:12,392
I wanna talk about my child,
our baby.

176
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,937
- Maybe.
- Maybe what?

177
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,649
Maybe it is our baby
and maybe it isn't.

178
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,442
Dick?

179
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,862
Oh, my Lord, is he the father?

180
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,698
At first I thought
you were the father.

181
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,534
But then you said
you didn't have any sperms.

182
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,874
Then I thought it was Dick, but now
you say your sperms are back.

183
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,627
So as far as I can tell,
it's a 50-50 proposition.

184
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,215
Andy, where are you going?

185
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,551
What are you doing?

186
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,930
Who are you calling?

187
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,183
I want to speak to Richard Tremayne,
Men's Fashions.

188
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,436
Yes, I'll hold.

189
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,105
You won't hurt him, will you, Andy?

190
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,319
Tremayne, Brennan.
Andy Brennan.

191
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,112
We need to talk.

192
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,866
That is, if you're not too busy.

193
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,006
Tojamura-san.

194
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,343
How nice of you to come calling.

195
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,762
You are in prison.

196
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,848
Yes, well,

197
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,477
a momentary inconvenience,
I assure you.

198
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,939
We have papers to sign.

199
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,150
The Ghostwood contracts.

200
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,196
Tojamura-san,

201
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:52,033
I'm afraid there's, uh...
There's been a snag.

202
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,826
A snag?

203
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,789
Unforeseen difficulties.
Some legal in nature, others, uh...

204
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,544
I, uh... I'm unable to sign
the Ghostwood agreement at this time.

205
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,674
Then you will return
my 5 million dollars.

206
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,053
Well, I want to return your money.

207
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,138
I want to sign the contracts.

208
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,600
Tojamura-san,

209
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,436
as you can see,

210
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,522
I am incarcerated.

211
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,775
Falsely accused,

212
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,196
but my brother, heh, the boy genius,

213
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:34,075
is out looking for a better lawyer.

214
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,161
And until justice is done,

215
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:43,835
until I am able to breathe the air
that free men breathe,

216
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,423
I plead with you for understanding.

217
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:56,264
This is the long, dark night
of my soul.

218
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,183
Time to seek that...

219
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:04,605
...tiny flickering flame within.

220
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,276
Forgive me,
I've been very emotional lately.

221
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,834
Catherine?

222
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,587
Benjamin Horne.

223
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:32,008
You're a slimy rat bastard.

224
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:36,721
And I intend to make whatever
remains of your pathetic existence

225
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,598
a living hell.

226
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,767
Oh, Catherine.

227
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,810
Oh! Ha, ha.

228
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,188
Oh, my God.

229
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,607
You've come.

230
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,695
Oh, Catherine.

231
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,656
Catherine, Catherine,
tell Sheriff Truman

232
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,284
about the night
that we spent together

233
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,329
the night that Laura was killed.

234
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,083
You want me to beg? Huh?

235
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,210
You want me to beg?
Because I'll beg.

236
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,297
Will you sign Ghostwood
and the mill over to me?

237
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,133
In a heartbeat.

238
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:20,014
Oh. Clever disguise, Catherine.

239
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,016
Really brilliant. Oh.

240
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,729
Signed, sealed

241
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,024
and delivered.

242
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,819
Now, you'll tell the sheriff, huh?

243
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,821
You'll tell the sheriff.

244
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,156
I'll consider it.

245
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,952
Catherine. Catherine, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

246
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,163
It's the truth, after all.

247
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:49,001
Heh, why, Ben, we've spent our entire
adult lives lying to each other.

248
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,629
Why spoil it with the truth now?

249
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:58,052
Catherine.

250
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,181
Catherine!

251
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,517
Donna,

252
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,353
I'm so happy you stopped by.

253
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:12,024
We haven't had the time
to just sit down and talk for so long.

254
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,861
May I get you a glass of lemonade?

255
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,073
No, thanks, Mr. Palmer.
I only have a minute. Uh...

256
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,702
This is for Maddy. It's a tape
of a song we did with James.

257
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,620
I want her to have a copy.

258
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,664
That's very sweet of you.

259
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,666
She told me all about this.

260
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,419
She said it was
a very enjoyable experience.

261
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,256
Anyway, if you could mail it to her,
I'd really appreciate it.

262
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,301
No, it won't be any problem at all.

263
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,390
Heh. Is something wrong?

264
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,184
No.

265
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,645
Those glasses.

266
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,191
They were Laura's.
Maddy gave them to me.

267
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,194
I thought they looked familiar.

268
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,629
- Mr. Palmer,
- Huh?

269
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:18,132
Did you know
that they found Laura's secret diary?

270
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:23,387
Diary? Yes,
they took it from her room.

271
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,766
No, not the one the police found.

272
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,476
She had another one.

273
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,312
I didn't even know about it,
did you?

274
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,148
No.

275
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,984
She gave it to a man
named Harold Smith.

276
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,614
Harold killed himself a few days ago.

277
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,741
The police found it in his apartment.

278
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,576
Oh, my God.

279
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,454
I had no idea.

280
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,416
I wish I knew what was in it,
don't you?

281
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,086
I think about Laura all the time.

282
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,134
Oh, excuse me.

283
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,807
Hello?

284
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,060
Yeah, Beth, how are you?

285
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,146
No, not since yesterday.

286
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,650
Of course, Beth. I took Maddy
to the bus station myself.

287
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,278
Well, I...

288
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:24,031
I'm sure there must be some
perfectly reasonable explanation.

289
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,867
Yes, of course.
I'll call you immediately,

290
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,494
within the hour.

291
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,954
Bye, Beth.

292
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,253
Huh.

293
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,172
Maddy?

294
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,634
It's the strangest thing.

295
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,553
She never made it home.

296
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,596
Oh, God.

297
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,356
Oh. Donna, don't you worry
about a thing.

298
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,693
I'll get us some lemonade

299
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,196
and we'll sit down
and give it a think

300
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,158
and we'll work the problem out.

301
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,410
Together.

302
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,410
I knew she was expecting us,
I mean...

303
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,996
I guess I was selfish.
I thought I could see her any time.

304
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,956
Missoula's not that far away, right?

305
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:59,794
Donna, you're taking this much
too much to heart.

306
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,505
I'm sure she's just fine.

307
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,467
I know the cure for what ails you.

308
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,802
It's simple, really.

309
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,262
It always makes me feel good.

310
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,183
May we have this dance...

311
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,185
...please?

312
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,518
You stay right there.

313
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,612
Harry?

314
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,697
Leland, we need your help.

315
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,240
What is it?

316
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,951
- There's been another murder.
- Oh, my God.

317
00:24:56,119 --> 00:25:00,206
I can't tell you why or how but we need
your help and we need it right away.

318
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,250
All right, anything, certainly.
Let me get my coat.

319
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:15,930
Maddy.

320
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,743
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

321
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,121
- It's Maddy.
- What about her?

322
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,957
She's dead.

323
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,211
It was the same killer.
The same one who killed Laura.

324
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,134
I heard Mr. Palmer get a phone call
from her mother.

325
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,095
She said
she hadn't gotten home yet.

326
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,764
Then they came over to talk to him,
Sheriff Truman.

327
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,601
- We could've helped her.
- How?

328
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,353
I don't know.

329
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,692
- This is no good.
- What do you mean?

330
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,027
You mean us?

331
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,784
- I gotta go.
- James, it's not our fault, don't leave.

332
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,744
It doesn't matter, don't you see?

333
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,081
Nothing we do matters.
Nothing's ever gonna change.

334
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:28,919
It doesn't matter if we're happy
and the rest of the world goes to hell.

335
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,173
James, don't leave.

336
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,468
James, don't leave me!

337
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,848
Harry.

338
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,893
Leland.

339
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,605
Why are we here, Agent Cooper?

340
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,775
Is someone meeting us?

341
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,443
Yes.

342
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,403
Is it the killer?

343
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,281
I don't know. Maybe.

344
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,912
Ed, glad you're here.

345
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,665
I need everyone's help
to clear the room.

346
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,668
I need a large space in the center.

347
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,629
Of course.

348
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,726
Hail, hail. The gang's all here.

349
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,564
Bobby, why don't you wheel Leo
back over there?

350
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,483
Stay very, very quiet, you read me?

351
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,735
Give yourself a raise, Hawk.

352
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,413
Gentlemen, two days ago
a young woman was found murdered

353
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,665
by the same individual,
I believe, responsible

354
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,126
for the death of Laura Palmer.

355
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:37,256
I have reason to believe
that the killer is in this room.

356
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,551
As a member of the Bureau,
I spend most of my time

357
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,804
seeking simple answers
to difficult questions.

358
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:47,599
In the pursuit of Laura's killer,
I have employed Bureau guidelines,

359
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:53,731
deductive technique,
Tibetan method, instinct and luck.

360
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,567
But now I find myself
in need of something new,

361
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,779
which for lack of a better word
we shall call "magic."

362
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,370
Would you like us to hum?

363
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,873
A Tibetan chant, perhaps.

364
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:16,003
I think it's going terrifically well,
don't you?

365
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,006
Now what?

366
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,468
Harry, I'm not completely sure.

367
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,138
Someone is missing.

368
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,773
Excuse us.

369
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,026
Major Briggs, right on time.

370
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,153
I was on my way home.

371
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,072
This kind gentleman
flagged me down,

372
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,075
asked if I could drive him here.

373
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:05,219
I know that gum.
I used to chew it when I was a kid.

374
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,971
That's my most favorite gum
in the world.

375
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,767
That gum you like
is going to come back in style.

376
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,995
My father

377
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,581
killed me.

378
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,169
Ben Horne,

379
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,881
I would like you to accompany me
to the sheriff's station.

380
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:28,635
You might like to bring along
Leland Palmer as your attorney.

381
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,603
Let's take him down to interrogation.

382
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,233
Agent Cooper,
is he going to be charged?

383
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,860
Yes.

384
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,072
Then I think I'd like to begin bail
proceedings as soon as possible.

385
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,240
He'll have his day in court.

386
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,662
Harry.

387
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,643
Everything will be all right, Ben.

388
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,413
Hawk, take Ben upstairs
and release him.

389
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,748
- Leland?
- That's not Leland.

390
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,128
How did you know?

391
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,797
Laura told me in her dream.

392
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,258
We're gonna need
a lot stronger evidence than this.

393
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,427
How about a confession, Harry?

394
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,556
You have the right to an attorney.

395
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:41,059
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

396
00:33:55,658 --> 00:34:00,037
Oh, yeah. I suppose you wanna
ask him some questions, huh?

397
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,290
Did you kill Laura Palmer?

398
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,881
That's a yes.

399
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,258
How about Madeleine Ferguson?

400
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,177
- What do you think?
- I'm asking you.

401
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,262
- What do you think?
- Answer the question.

402
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,724
Oh, gosh, gee, gee whiz.
I guess I kind of sort of did.

403
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,768
I have this thing for knives.

404
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,729
Just like what happened to you
in Pittsburgh that time.

405
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,731
Huh, Cooper?

406
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,359
Oh, Leland.

407
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,779
Leland, Leland.

408
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,947
You've been a good vehicle

409
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,325
and I've enjoyed the ride.

410
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,827
But now he's weak and full of holes.

411
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,830
It's almost nearly time
to shuffle off to Buffalo.

412
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,958
Does Leland know
what you've done?

413
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,586
Ah, Leland's a babe in the woods

414
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,882
with a large hole
where his conscience used to be.

415
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,886
And when I go, children,
I will pull that ripcord

416
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,598
and you watch Leland, remember.
Watch him.

417
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,767
But not for long.

418
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,945
That's enough for me.

419
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,136
Dick,

420
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,847
could you come with me, please?

421
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,897
Okay, here's how
this is going to work.

422
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,359
- I'm going to keep my baby.
- Oh.

423
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,653
That's not open for discussion.

424
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,615
- I see.
- Be quiet, let her talk.

425
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,742
Got a light?

426
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,623
No.

427
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,836
You were saying.

428
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,715
There's only one way to handle this.

429
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:20,594
They have a test to determine
the blood type of the father.

430
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,554
It could be you

431
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,431
or it could be you.

432
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,935
They won't be doing this test
until after the baby is born,

433
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,105
during which time
I expect complete cooperation

434
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,774
from each of you two gentlemen.

435
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,068
Whatever you say, Lucy.

436
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,362
I mean, it is your baby.

437
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,239
Thank you.

438
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,461
Ben Horne's blood test,
he's the wrong type.

439
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,923
Harry, the answer was right in front
of me from the very beginning.

440
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,842
What did the little man do
in my dream?

441
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,471
He danced.

442
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,016
After Laura's death,
Leland danced compulsively.

443
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,311
We were told that Bob the killer
was a gray-haired man.

444
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,481
When Leland killed Jacques,
his hair turned gray overnight.

445
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,233
Leland said when he was a child

446
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,944
the gray-haired man next door
was named Robertson.

447
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,821
Mike said the people Bob inhabited
were his children.

448
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,699
Robertson, son of Robert.

449
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,285
The letters under the fingernails:
R, O, B, T.

450
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,912
Bob was spelling his name.

451
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,331
A signature on a demon self-portrait.

452
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,166
Why would he kill her?

453
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,293
Laura was writing about Bob
in her diary.

454
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,588
Leland found it, ripped out the pages.
She knew he was on to her.

455
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,299
It was Leland who placed that call
from Ben Horne's office

456
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,926
to Laura the night she died.

457
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,262
He was the third man
outside Jacques' cabin.

458
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:49,474
He took the girls to the train car. It was
his blood we found, not Ben Horne's.

459
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,436
- Then why kill Maddy?
- Maybe she reminded him of Laura.

460
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,314
Maddy was going home.
He couldn't bear to part with her.

461
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,024
He wanted to relive the experience

462
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:01,194
or maybe she realized
Bob was the killer and he found out.

463
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,656
Now, this Bob.

464
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,868
He can't really exist.
I mean, Leland is just crazy, right?

465
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,247
Through the dark of futures past

466
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,625
The magician longs to see

467
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,254
One chants out between two worlds

468
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,882
Fire walk with me

469
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,345
I'll catch you with my death bag

470
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,056
You may think I've gone insane

471
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:34,060
But I promise I will kill again!

472
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,803
Harry, hurry.

473
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,180
The key.

474
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:16,978
Leland!

475
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,606
Harry. Leland.

476
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,741
Call an ambulance.

477
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,204
Oh, God, Laura.

478
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,206
I killed her.

479
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:40,126
Oh, my God. I killed my daughter.

480
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,170
I didn't know.

481
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,172
Laura, forgive me.

482
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,508
Forgive me.

483
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,219
- Oh, God.
- It's okay.

484
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,346
It's all right.

485
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,475
I was just a boy.

486
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,561
I saw him in my dreams.

487
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,648
He said he wanted to play.

488
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:07,862
He opened me and I invited him
and he came inside me.

489
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,322
He went inside?

490
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,785
When he was inside, I didn't know.

491
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:19,165
And when he was gone,
I couldn't remember.

492
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,668
He made me do things...

493
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,504
...terrible things.

494
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,298
He said he wanted lives,

495
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,008
he wanted others.

496
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:34,013
Others that they could use
like they used me.

497
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,266
Like Laura?

498
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,851
They wanted her.

499
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,187
They wanted Laura,
but she was strong.

500
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,106
She fought them.

501
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,483
She wouldn't let them in.

502
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,153
Oh, God.

503
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,906
They had me kill that girl, Theresa.

504
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,995
And they... They said...

505
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,290
...if I didn't give them Laura,

506
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,376
they'd have me kill her too.

507
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,546
But she wouldn't let them in?

508
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:13,261
She said she'd die
before she let them.

509
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,474
And they made me kill her.

510
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:22,562
Oh, God, have mercy on me.

511
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:29,110
What have I done?

512
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:34,115
Oh, God, I love her.

513
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,994
I loved her with all my heart.

514
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,081
My angel, forgive me.

515
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,589
Leland.

516
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,098
Leland, the time has come
for you to seek the path.

517
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:03,061
Your soul has set you
face to face with a clear light

518
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,731
and you are now about to experience it
in its reality,

519
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:10,527
wherein all things are like the void
and cloudless sky

520
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:15,698
and the naked, spotless intellect
is like a transparent vacuum

521
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,952
without circumference or center.

522
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,163
Leland, in this moment,
know yourself

523
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,999
and abide in that state.

524
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,504
Look to the light, Leland.

525
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,006
Find the light.

526
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,551
I see it.

527
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,681
Into the light, Leland.
Into the light.

528
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,560
I see her.

529
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,063
She's there.

530
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,649
Into the light, Leland.

531
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,652
She's beautiful.

532
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,988
Into the light.

533
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,200
Laura.

534
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,078
Don't be afraid.

535
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:01,721
He was completely insane.

536
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,348
Think so?

537
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,350
But people saw Bob.

538
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:10,355
People saw him in visions:
Laura, Maddy, Sarah Palmer.

539
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,399
Gentlemen,
there's more in heaven and earth

540
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,818
than is dreamt up in our philosophy.

541
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,654
Amen.

542
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,825
Well, I've lived in these old woods
most of my life.

543
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,163
I've seen some strange things
but this is way off the map.

544
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,750
I'm having a hard time believing.

545
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,752
Harry, is it easier to believe

546
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,755
a man would rape and murder
his own daughter?

547
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,216
Any more comforting?

548
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,385
No.

549
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:46,265
An evil that great
in this beautiful world...

550
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,895
Finally,
does it matter what the cause?

551
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:55,149
Yes, because it's our job to stop it.

552
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,902
Yeah.

553
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,076
Maybe that's all Bob is.

554
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,578
The evil that men do.

555
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,832
Maybe it doesn't matter
what we call it.

556
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,709
Maybe not.

557
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,963
But if he was real, if he was here,

558
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,923
and we had him trapped

559
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,050
and he got away,

560
00:45:22,261 --> 00:46:47,303
where's Bob now?
