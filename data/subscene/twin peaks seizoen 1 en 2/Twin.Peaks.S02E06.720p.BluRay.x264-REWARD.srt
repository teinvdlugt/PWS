1
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,895
I trusted you.

2
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,942
I invested my heart and soul in you.

3
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,402
- We only want to read it.
- We didn't mean any harm.

4
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,030
I thought you were different.

5
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,533
You made me feel

6
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,077
I could return to the world

7
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:06,542
and find something decent, pure.

8
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,128
But you're just like all the others.

9
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,255
You lie.

10
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,173
And you betray.

11
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,008
And then you laugh about it!

12
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,178
You are unclean.

13
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,974
You have contaminated me.

14
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,061
- Now give it to me.
- Aah!

15
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,484
- Donna.
- Donna!

16
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,445
No.

17
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,494
He's not coming. He won't.
He's afraid.

18
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:48,542
- Did he hurt you? Are you okay?
- No. I'm fine. I'm fine. I...

19
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,755
I'm sorry, James. It's all my fault.

20
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:58,468
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, don't cry. It's my fault too.

21
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,762
We gotta go to the sheriff now, okay?

22
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,639
You've had enough trouble.
I'll go.

23
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:08,103
- No, I'll go.
- James, just hold me, okay? Okay.

24
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,667
We're all set up inside.

25
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,223
Sluggish pulse.

26
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,184
Pupils constricted.

27
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,104
Breathing slow and shallow.

28
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,986
Needle marks. Most likely heroin.

29
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,821
Poor kid.

30
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,781
Daddy?

31
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,536
Can you see me?
Can you see me, Daddy?

32
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,621
Audrey, you got to stay awake.

33
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,207
Can you catch me?

34
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,127
- Can you?
- Audrey.

35
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,170
Talk to me, Audrey.

36
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,881
Stay awake. Audrey?

37
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,384
His tongue is so heavy.

38
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,137
The hand on my throat.

39
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,597
It hurts me.

40
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,517
Oh, God, it hurts me.

41
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,020
Black cold.

42
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,564
I can't breathe.

43
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,566
Help me, please, help me.

44
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,861
I'm sinking. I'm sinking.

45
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,240
All right. It's all right, Audrey,
I'm right here. Audrey, I'm right here.

46
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,291
I prayed.

47
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,337
I prayed that you would come.

48
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,048
And you did.

49
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,475
It's okay. It's okay.

50
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:58,106
She was so brave. I feel terrible.
If anything had happened to her...

51
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:02,069
No more plans, okay?
No more going off on our own.

52
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,781
James, he has Laura's secret diary.
He could have killed her.

53
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,325
He could have killed you too.

54
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,037
Pretty stupid, huh?

55
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,123
Well, after Laura died,

56
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,209
everything just went by kind of fast,
you know.

57
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,795
It's hard to know exactly
what to believe in.

58
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,630
Yeah.

59
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,634
But when I saw you tonight,
I knew exactly what I believed.

60
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,928
Did you?

61
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,514
It's like if we could put
our hearts together

62
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:34,768
and keep them that way forever,
we'd be safe, no matter what.

63
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,812
You and me?

64
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,356
From now on.

65
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,900
Yes.

66
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,420
How is she?

67
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,630
She is through the worst of it.

68
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,134
Heroin, Harry.

69
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,803
This close to a lethal dose.

70
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,557
Hard to imagine such cruelty.

71
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,518
Not really.

72
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,853
Look at this.

73
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,938
Blackie's killer.

74
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,982
I knew I'd seen him before.

75
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,734
- Jean Renault.
- Renault?

76
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,028
Oldest brother
of Jacques and Bernard.

77
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,530
Hell of a lot more dangerous.

78
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,574
He runs the northern territories.

79
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,869
Gambling, drugs, extortion,
you name it.

80
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,997
Now, I saw

81
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,791
a tape on the TV in Blackie's office
of you

82
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,420
playing blackjack the night
you and Big Ed went to the casino.

83
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,006
Jean Renault was after me.

84
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,258
The man who caught his brother.

85
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,095
He planned to kill me
and he used Audrey as bait.

86
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,142
I went out of my jurisdiction.

87
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,518
Twice.

88
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,312
I've violated my professional code

89
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,481
and now Audrey is paying the price.

90
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,526
You got her back.
And she's gonna be okay.

91
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,571
This isn't the first time my actions
have brought suffering to someone

92
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,074
I care about, in the name
of doing what I had to do.

93
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,076
Damn it. I should have known better.

94
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,037
Doesn't change the fact
that she's here now,

95
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,414
not up at Jack's with a needle
in her arm.

96
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,839
You know,

97
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,592
you are the best lawman

98
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,636
I've ever seen.

99
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,095
But, Coop,

100
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,431
sometimes you think too much.

101
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,644
Thank you, Harry.

102
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,667
Agent Cooper.

103
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,794
I got your call.

104
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,880
What happened? Did you, uh?

105
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,509
I was able to free your daughter
without the payment.

106
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,845
Thank God.

107
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,473
She was being held at a brothel
north of the border,

108
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,976
known as One-Eyed Jack's.

109
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,519
No.

110
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,398
It seems the brothel's madam
was at least partially responsible

111
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,192
for her kidnapping
and subsequent blackmail.

112
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,361
Did you arrest her?

113
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,864
She was killed
before I could question her.

114
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,825
No.

115
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,036
Murdered by a man named
Jean Renault.

116
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,499
This Jean Renault,
did you catch him?

117
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,918
He escaped.

118
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,506
Too bad.

119
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:58,388
Well, everything seems to be
in order.

120
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,057
Your daughter is recovering
from a drug overdose.

121
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,105
Drug overdose?

122
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,025
Oh, my God.

123
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,485
She's gonna be all right.

124
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,946
Can I see her?

125
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,616
She's resting comfortably now,
I wouldn't disturb her.

126
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,118
I'll call you in the morning.

127
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,497
Yes.

128
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,917
Yes, you do that, Agent Cooper.

129
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,961
Thank you.

130
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,799
Thank you

131
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,636
for bringing my Audrey back to me.

132
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,308
Good night, Mr. Horne.

133
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,394
Poor fellow is really gone.

134
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,270
You ain't kidding.

135
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,065
Oh, I want you to know
how much I admire you kids,

136
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,900
standing by Mr. Johnson.

137
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,194
Not taking the easy way out.

138
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,571
Most people would just ship him off.

139
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,951
Yeah, well, Leo's sort of special
to us both.

140
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:49,249
Believe you me, in-home care
is the stuff of miracles.

141
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,793
Mr. Johnson should benefit
tremendously

142
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,212
from being here
among his loved ones.

143
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,714
Oh, we certainly hope so.

144
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,718
Mm. Will you be hiring
full- or part-time help?

145
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:04,723
Um, Cousin Bobby and I
will be here full-time.

146
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,352
I just admire your dedication.

147
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,275
Well, everything looks to be in order.

148
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,653
You might want to childproof
those electrical sockets.

149
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,863
Okay.

150
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,698
Please sign right there.

151
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,332
- Mm-hm. Your check.
- Thank you.

152
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,173
Um, there must be a mistake.

153
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,765
- Seven hundred bucks?
- Sad, isn't it?

154
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,059
The cost of health care
is going through the roof.

155
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,936
It's bringing rain.

156
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,981
We're supposed to get
5,000 a month.

157
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,693
But with figure state and local taxes,
equipment fees,

158
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,071
medical and maintenance costs,
administrative fees...

159
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,616
Well, you see the results.

160
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,202
Fortunately with you two here,

161
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:11,372
Mr. Johnson will be
more than adequately provided for.

162
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,416
Good luck.

163
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,002
I'll find my own way out.

164
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,174
I have to quit my job, Bobby.

165
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,968
How am I going to make it on this?

166
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,721
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

167
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,557
It was your bright idea
to bring him here in the first place.

168
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,685
Come on, Shelly,
I'm thinking, all right?

169
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,897
You better think of something, Bobby.
For the both of us.

170
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,866
Donna, we already have
Laura Palmer's diary.

171
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,953
No, this is her secret diary.

172
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,957
- She gave it to this Howard Smith?
- Harold.

173
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,000
- Why?
- I don't know why.

174
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,169
To hide it or something.

175
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,215
Did he ever actually show you
the diary?

176
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,760
No.

177
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,763
But he read from it.
I saw her name on the inside cover.

178
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,267
- Her handwriting.
- Are you and James up to something?

179
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,394
He has been warned
not to get mixed up...

180
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,521
James has nothing to do with this.

181
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,941
Donna, it is a lot like
the boy who cried wolf.

182
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,485
The last time you played this game,

183
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,196
Dr. Jacoby ended up in a hospital bed.

184
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,532
It's not a game.

185
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,494
All right.

186
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,205
I'll try to get someone out there
to take a look.

187
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,708
But my hands are full.
I can't promise anything.

188
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,128
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a Sheriff Harry S. Truman.

189
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,463
- You found him.
- Sheriff, please.

190
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,757
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Sheriff Harry S. Truman.

191
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,176
- That's me.
- Federal Bureau of Investigation

192
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,178
Regional Bureau Chief, Gordon Cole.

193
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,681
That's a real mouthful,
but I can't hear myself anyway.

194
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,975
I'm Agent Cooper's supervisor.

195
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,853
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Can I speak with you a moment?

196
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,439
Sure. Donna.

197
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,275
Wait here.

198
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,404
And who did you say you were?

199
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,324
- I'm Sheriff Truman.
- Great. Pay dirt.

200
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,827
You have to speak up, sheriff,
hearing's gone. Long story.

201
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,038
Got these things
cranked up to the max.

202
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,583
Are you looking for Agent Cooper?

203
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,128
When an agent goes down in the field,
I jump right up and pay a visit.

204
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,755
Agent Cooper's not here right now.

205
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,174
Albert Rosenfield will not be
coming back,

206
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,843
but I've got his lab report right here.

207
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,471
Item: a Vicuna coat.

208
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,225
Albert found fibers in the hall outside
of Cooper's room from a Vicuna coat.

209
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,020
Coat was Vicuna?

210
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,273
Sounds real good, sheriff,
but I already ate.

211
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,361
Also got a lab report from Albert
on the one-armer's syringe.

212
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,115
Albert has never seen a drug like it.
A combo. Really weird stuff.

213
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,659
What else does Albert say?

214
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,661
Papers. Papers found near
the bloody towel

215
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,829
down the train tracks
from the crime site.

216
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,957
- From a diary.
- Please.

217
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,085
There's the one-armer now.

218
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,379
Since when is selling shoes
against the law?

219
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,674
Mr. Gerard, we need to ask you
a few questions.

220
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,426
- Huh?
- Why don't we move over to my office.

221
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,266
- My office.
- Right.

222
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,860
She looks like an angel.

223
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,948
Audrey?

224
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,616
Audrey?

225
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,160
Your father is here.

226
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,165
Thank God, Audrey.

227
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,504
Thank God.

228
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,883
I was so worried about you.

229
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,219
Were you?

230
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,430
I was worried sick.

231
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,726
You know, it's times like these

232
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:04,230
that make a man aware
of the value of life.

233
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:09,777
Every raindrop, every sunset.

234
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,614
I'm aware of a lot of new things too,
Daddy.

235
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,074
Shh, shh, shh.

236
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:22,290
Now, we will get you home,
safe, warm, in your own bed.

237
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,296
What a terrible experience,
terrible people.

238
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:33,134
- The things that you must have seen.
- I saw so much.

239
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,807
We'll sort it out.

240
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,601
Together.

241
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,104
Yes, Daddy.

242
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,648
You and I.

243
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,237
That's my girl.

244
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,082
My car is outside.

245
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,210
I'll take her home now.

246
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,465
- Daddy?
- Yes, darling.

247
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,261
I would like Agent Cooper to take me
home if that's all right with you.

248
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,641
Fine.

249
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,103
Maybe...

250
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,815
Maybe we could all go together.
Hmm.

251
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,448
Hi, Ed. I'm home.

252
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,827
Isn't this the swellest dress
you have ever seen?

253
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,703
Do you know
they didn't look at me twice

254
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,622
when I used the charge card?

255
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,334
Say, Ed, when do my parents
get back from Europe, anyway?

256
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,337
Well, uh, pretty soon.

257
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:56,134
It's neat having the place
all to ourselves.

258
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,885
Pretend it's ours.

259
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,720
Like we were married or something.

260
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,806
Well, we can do that. Nadine...

261
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,809
And there's some other stuff
we can do too.

262
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,394
Well, like what?

263
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,480
You know, silly. Ha, ha.

264
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,359
You know what I was thinking?

265
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,904
Tonight maybe we could go park
by the lake,

266
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,906
and neck.

267
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,242
Wait a minute.

268
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,036
We don't have to go anywhere.

269
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:28,541
Why, we can just stay right here.

270
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,184
You've kept yourself
in fine nick, Josie.

271
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,853
Sapphire earrings,

272
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,897
Parisian perfume,

273
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,648
cashmere sweaters.

274
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,150
Please go.

275
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,071
One-way ticket.

276
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,157
Seattle, Hong Kong.

277
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,497
- I have one more day.
- Keep what you earn.

278
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,375
See what you can fit
into your suitcases.

279
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,586
We leave tonight.

280
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,174
I haven't received
my insurance money.

281
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,510
And Ben Horne hasn't paid me yet
either.

282
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,388
I waited for this for five years.

283
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:28,309
Mr. Eckhardt will make it more
than worth your while.

284
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,231
You can't make me leave.

285
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,365
Be adaptable.

286
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,702
We had an arrangement.

287
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,791
Sheriff Truman is important to you.

288
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,293
You lied to him.

289
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,963
You made him into a fool.

290
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:01,175
But he is important to you
nonetheless.

291
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,264
Leave with me tonight.
Or I'll kill him.

292
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,808
He doesn't know anything.

293
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:14,188
The plane leaves at midnight.
Be there.

294
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,775
Or I'll come for you and your sheriff.

295
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,487
That's the arrangement.

296
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,061
- Hi.
- Hi.

297
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,733
I think I owe you an apology.

298
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,402
Not really.

299
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:07,074
Well, when we were together,
you know, just talking,

300
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,953
I felt something. I just wasn't sure.

301
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,372
You looked at me and you saw Laura.

302
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,708
I guess I did.

303
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,128
Wanna know something
kind of strange?

304
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,130
What?

305
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,132
I liked it.

306
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,801
You did?

307
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,471
When we were growing up,

308
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:32,058
Laura and I were so close.
It was scary.

309
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,768
I could feel her thoughts,

310
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,395
like our brains were connected
or something.

311
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,230
And when she died suddenly,

312
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,441
I got the chance to be Laura.

313
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,943
At least other people saw me that way.

314
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,447
Like the way that you looked at me.

315
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,242
I liked that too.

316
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,373
But it was wrong.

317
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,210
It wasn't one thing or the other.

318
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,006
For a while,
I got to be somebody different.

319
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,011
But now I'm just me again.

320
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,848
James,

321
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:16,310
you and Donna belong together.

322
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,063
That's the best thing.

323
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:28,322
- It's just hard sometimes, you know?
- How?

324
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,699
If you really love someone,

325
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,661
it's like this bright light
is shining on you all the time.

326
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,622
You're right in it and it's great.

327
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:41,335
But I just don't think you can be
that way all the time.

328
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,672
Sure you can.

329
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,299
Well, I want to.

330
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,013
I want to try to make the way
my heart feels last forever.

331
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,890
Pretty weird.

332
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,776
I'm going home tomorrow, James.

333
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,865
I came to Twin Peaks
for Laura's funeral.

334
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,617
But now it's time to go.

335
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,415
So is this goodbye?

336
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,046
I guess it is.

337
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,477
Bye, James.

338
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,454
To the fire.

339
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:11,217
Now, to what do I owe
the pleasure of this call?

340
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,054
I've got the contract
with Pete's signature.

341
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,348
And I want my money.

342
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,141
Of course you do.

343
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,770
All of it. Now.
Before you get this.

344
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,606
Josie, Josie.

345
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,318
Surely a mind
as quicksilver as your own

346
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,279
can grasp the complicated position
that we're in.

347
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,073
Fluidity is everything, you know.

348
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,618
I can't summon up cash reserves
that I don't have.

349
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:41,205
But I have already

350
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,833
and I will be happy
to assure you again

351
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,086
that as soon as
the contracted payments

352
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,838
arrive from Iceland,

353
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,968
your percentage will immediately be
passed on.

354
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:57,972
I won't leave this office
without my money.

355
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:05,187
Why do I sense that, um,
this isn't a negotiable position?

356
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,652
You're under some kind of pressure,
aren't you?

357
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,613
Do not play games with me.

358
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,992
Games?

359
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,497
Josie,

360
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:28,210
this key, ahem, unlocks
my personal hotel safe.

361
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,879
Now, in that safe,

362
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:35,175
I have put together
a fascinating dossier on you, my dear,

363
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:39,513
and your late husband...
Andrew's little boat that went boom.

364
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,225
So you behave yourself, lady,

365
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:50,107
or believe me when I say
that I will bury you.

366
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,651
That's a shame.

367
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:57,156
Because if anything unfortunate
were to happen to me,

368
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,491
it would lead authorities

369
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:04,038
to a certain safety deposit box
in a bank in another city,

370
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,582
inside of which
there is enough evidence

371
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,252
to lock you away for three lifetimes.

372
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,340
They will bury us side by side.

373
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,931
Stalemate.

374
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,268
Your move.

375
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,064
Cash.

376
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:39,114
Happily, I can accommodate you.

377
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,496
Sign of good faith.

378
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,002
Tokyo bank.

379
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:59,718
Five million dollars.

380
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,020
We are finished.

381
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,733
Josie.

382
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,905
Well played.

383
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,552
Leo.

384
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,306
We sort of figured
with you getting out and all.

385
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:50,185
Well, what the hell, we sort of wanted
to give you a little party.

386
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,772
Our way of saying,
"Hey, Leo Johnson, welcome home."

387
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,733
Welcome home, darling.

388
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:59,611
Because you're a special guy, Leo.
And we just want you to know

389
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:04,408
that we remember all the great stuff
you did for the ones you loved.

390
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,994
Like Shelly here.

391
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,915
Who could ask for a more caring
and thoughtful husband?

392
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:16,336
Making her clean your dirty clothes.
Wash your dishes.

393
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,506
Mop your floors.
You're a class act, man.

394
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,842
- Top to bottom.
- Class act.

395
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:25,137
And how about Leo Johnson,
wife abuser?

396
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,556
There's a guy I wanna party with.

397
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,683
Soap in a sock.

398
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,686
Internal injuries
and barely leaves a bruise.

399
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,981
And last, but I'm thinking,

400
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,441
not least,

401
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,860
we got Leo Johnson, murderer.

402
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,404
Hanging your wife up
like a piece of meat.

403
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,323
Leaving her to burn.

404
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,158
Don't let anybody ever tell you

405
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,744
you don't know how to treat
a woman, buddy.

406
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,417
This is your life, Leo Johnson.

407
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,962
You deserve it.

408
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:04,009
Every damn minute.

409
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,659
He moved.

410
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,995
- This is too creepy. I don't like this.
- Okay. Okay, Shel...

411
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,705
Okay, maybe you're right.

412
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,625
I mean, I don't want to exploit him
or nothing.

413
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:41,004
Sorry, Leo.
We sort of got carried away.

414
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:46,468
No need to make your rehabilitation
any more difficult than it already is.

415
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,972
Doc Hayward said
you needed familiar stimulus.

416
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,517
So we just figured, what the hell...

417
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,185
...kazoos.

418
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,937
Honest, Leo.

419
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,148
Shelly and me are going
to do everything we can

420
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,984
to make you feel safe and happy.

421
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,570
Hey, cake. You want some cake?

422
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:12,536
Oh, look at that.

423
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,872
Ice cream.

424
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,707
Bobby.

425
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,668
Hey, Leo. Oh, jeez.

426
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,921
Oh. Uh...

427
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,465
Man, you gotta be more careful.

428
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,596
Good thing we didn't light the candles.

429
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,735
Agent Dale Cooper.

430
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,195
Gordon, I hope you haven't been
waiting too long.

431
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,657
I didn't just get here. I've been waiting
the whole afternoon to see you.

432
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,867
What can I do for you?

433
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,786
No matter whatsoever.
No apology necessary.

434
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,331
Gave me a chance to meet
the local law enforcement team.

435
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,666
A great bunch.

436
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,377
Cooper.

437
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:07,466
You remind me today
of a small Mexican Chihuahua.

438
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,178
Can I speak to you
a moment in private, Coop?

439
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,763
Of course, Gordon.

440
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,806
Harry, can we use your office?

441
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,976
You might ask the sheriff
if we could use his office.

442
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,354
Go right ahead.

443
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,106
Follow me, Gordon.

444
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,985
I believe in secrecy, Coop.

445
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:31,114
I'll make this fast. I didn't want
to say anything in front of the men.

446
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:35,953
It's Albert's opinion that you might be
getting in over your head.

447
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,915
This worries me, Coop.
I feel a certain responsibility.

448
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,251
- Albert is wrong, Gordon.
- You went into the chute in Pittsburgh.

449
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,004
And I want to make doubly sure,
in fact triply sure,

450
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,465
that it does not happen again. Copy?

451
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,634
Pittsburgh was a completely
different story.

452
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,971
I was wounded in Pittsburgh, Gordon,

453
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,974
but beyond that,
the case bears no similarities.

454
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,309
I must say you look all right.

455
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,437
Trace of circles under the eyes,
catch up on your sleep.

456
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,233
But restless nights and uneasy dreams
go with the territory.

457
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,736
I am tired, Gordon.
There is much work to be done.

458
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:13,156
But mind, body and spirit
are up to the task.

459
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,159
Without a doubt, I'm A-okay.

460
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,621
Proud of you, Coop.

461
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,998
Now, Gordon.

462
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,543
What the hell is this
about a Mexican Chihuahua?

463
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,920
You've got a problem
of a different sort here.

464
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,048
Two and two do not always equal four.

465
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,302
You ought to know, we can hear
everything you're saying out in the hall.

466
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,972
- Come on in.
- Why don't you invite the sheriff on in.

467
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,684
An anonymous letter sent
to home base

468
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,893
with your name on it.

469
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,603
Looks kind of familiar, doesn't it?

470
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,696
It's a chess deal.

471
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,657
Looks like a chess deal.

472
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,244
It's an opening move
from Windom Earle.

473
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,788
Windom Earle.

474
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,415
Bless your heart, Coop.

475
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,460
We're gonna have to watch
your back from now on.

476
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,218
With Jerry on the road, well...

477
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,639
I need you back here.

478
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,808
Let's just say

479
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,562
that I have a much better sense
of what you've been through

480
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,273
- in the last few weeks.
- I appreciate that, Ben.

481
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,359
And I appreciate the confidence.
Really, I do.

482
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,864
If it weren't for your indictment,
I could drop you into your old slot.

483
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,994
You know, our friendship,
our history together.

484
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:45,874
But first, I need to know
that you're okay.

485
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,460
I'm 100 percent, Ben, 110 percent.

486
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,049
Let me prove it to you.

487
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:58,845
We've taken a payment
from the Icelanders on Ghostwood,

488
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:04,267
but there's a group from the Orient
that wants in, in the worst way.

489
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,104
Jerry is on his way to Tokyo
to check them out,

490
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,773
and probably every geisha
within a hundred miles.

491
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:13,610
I'm about to take Mr. Big to dinner.

492
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:22,327
We need to, uh,
buy a little time here.

493
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:26,957
Well, the first thing we do
is, um, resurvey the land.

494
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,834
Required because of the fire.

495
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,337
Then we set up a whole parade
of inspectors, federal, county, state,

496
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,381
until Jerry gets back with a full report.

497
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,801
If there's any money,
we can run it thru the Caymans.

498
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,678
Pick up some money
on the exchange rate.

499
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:44,391
And if we have to, we can drop escrow
into a black hole for six months.

500
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:53,150
- Ah?
- That's my Leland.

501
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,753
Josie?

502
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:17,883
Harry, I don't believe
you have met my assistant, Mr. Lee.

503
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,343
Pleased to meet you.

504
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,512
I'll take these to car.

505
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,811
- What are you doing?
- I'm going away.

506
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,522
Where? Why?

507
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,693
Harry.

508
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,321
Josie.

509
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,868
I always called you from here.

510
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,454
And then,

511
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,248
it was here I could talk to you...

512
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,169
...and be everything you wanted me
to be.

513
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,880
Well, then stay here.

514
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:04,679
I sold the mill. It's over.
I'm going home.

515
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,681
No.

516
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,110
I'm sorry, don't think badly of me.

517
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,906
Mr. Lee, leave us alone.

518
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,623
Josie, you can't leave.

519
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,668
You saying this as the police?

520
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,338
No.

521
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,259
It's best if you forget about me.

522
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,636
I love you.

523
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,856
Josie, I love you.

524
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,836
- Would you like a drink, Mr. Tojamura?
- No, thank you.

525
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,674
You have my cashier's check
for 5 million.

526
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:26,303
I have nothing.

527
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,096
Why?

528
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,807
Well, ahem...

529
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:37,105
I know so little about you,
Mr. Tojamura.

530
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,190
This is a small community.

531
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,276
I'm being careful.

532
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,863
Trying to be sensitive
to local concerns.

533
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,574
You must understand the impact

534
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,660
this project will have
on the community.

535
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,748
You waste my time.

536
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,666
We shall withdraw.

537
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,920
Oh, no. Please, Mr. Tojamura.

538
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,631
Consider the position that I'm in.

539
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,719
The mill fire created
a raft of unforeseen problems,

540
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,055
psychic as well as financial.

541
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,767
I feel it's my duty as a civic leader

542
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,895
to, uh, help foster
the healing process.

543
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,816
Even at the, um, temporary expense

544
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,027
of my larger business opportunities.

545
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,154
I know a little about fire.

546
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,656
My family was at Nagasaki.

547
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,370
I'm sorry.

548
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,331
Getting to know you

549
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:40,752
Getting to know all about you

550
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,670
Getting to like you

551
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,798
Getting to hope you like me

552
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,468
Getting to know you

553
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,595
Would you excuse me a moment?

554
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,056
But nicely

555
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:59,229
You are precisely my cup of tea

556
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,064
Where might you folks be from, sir?

557
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,358
- Right here in Twin Peaks.
- That's terrific.

558
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,402
How about those Steeplejacks, huh?

559
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,695
Getting to know you

560
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:11,699
Getting to feel free and easy

561
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,119
When I am near you

562
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:18,581
Getting to know what to say

563
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:24,546
Haven't you noticed
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy?

564
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:29,968
Because of all the beautiful
And new things

565
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,011
I am learning about you

566
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:39,310
Day by day

567
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,023
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.

568
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,693
Great Northern audiences
are the greatest in the world.

569
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:47,902
Thank you. Good night.

570
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,197
- Drive carefully.
- The King and I.

571
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,616
Give it a rest, Leland.

572
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,077
Temporary insanity, huh?

573
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,830
Hopefully some of these people
will be on your jury.

574
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,957
You will be home free.

575
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,753
You like musicals?

576
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,633
No.

577
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,390
Not even Fiddler on the Roof?

578
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,686
It made me weep like a little baby.

579
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:27,192
I find the adherence to fantasy
troubling and unreasonable.

580
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,030
Yeah.

581
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,997
You're not from around here, are you?

582
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,585
I am a visitor.

583
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,964
Yeah. Well, uh,
could I buy you a sake?

584
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,217
No, thank you.

585
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,974
Or how about a nice cold milk?

586
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,108
Please give me my medicine.

587
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:12,987
- I can feel the change.
- What change?

588
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,073
The drug found in his possession

589
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,952
contains trace elements
usually found in Haloperidol.

590
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,704
Do you suffer from schizophrenia?

591
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:25,708
- Multiple personalities?
- It's too late.

592
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,797
You know this man, don't you?
Why'd you lie when I questioned you?

593
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:35,760
- It wasn't me. Don't you understand?
- Give him the drug, chief.

594
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,346
- Not yet.
- If we give him the drug, Coop,

595
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,140
you'll never see the other side.

596
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,851
- Give him the medicine.
- No.

597
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:10,545
There is no need for medicine.
I am not in pain.

598
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,507
Who are you?

599
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,887
- My name is Mike.
- What are you?

600
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,933
I am an inhabiting spirit.

601
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,812
Who is Phillip Gerard?

602
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,274
He is host to me.

603
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,943
You spoke to me in my dream

604
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,697
about Bob.

605
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:43,328
He was my familiar.

606
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,622
Where does Bob come from?

607
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,418
That cannot be revealed.

608
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,798
What does Bob want?

609
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:01,304
He is Bob, eager for fun.

610
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:04,682
He wears a smile,

611
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,769
everybody run.

612
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,399
Do you understand the parasite?

613
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:18,863
It attaches itself
to a life form and feeds.

614
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:25,036
Bob requires a human host.

615
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:28,289
He feeds on fear

616
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,417
and the pleasures.

617
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,630
They are his children.

618
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,886
I am similar to Bob.

619
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,098
We once were partners.

620
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:51,145
- Through the darkness of future past
- Through the darkness of future past

621
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,315
- The magician longs to see
- The magician longs to see

622
00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:00,488
One chance out between two worlds

623
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:06,703
Fire walk with me

624
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:15,545
But then I saw the face of God

625
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:19,257
and was purified.

626
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,844
I took off the arm.

627
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,305
But remained close to this vessel.

628
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:31,602
Inhabiting from time to time
for one single purpose.

629
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,856
- To find Bob.
- To stop him.

630
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,818
This is his true face.

631
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,448
But few can see it.

632
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,658
The gifted...

633
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:51,873
...and the damned.

634
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,501
Is Bob near us now?

635
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,422
For nearly 40 years.

636
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,132
Where?

637
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:08,014
A large house made of wood.

638
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,308
Surrounded by trees.

639
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:16,063
The house is filled with many rooms,
each alike.

640
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:20,485
But occupied by different souls.

641
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,445
Night after night.

642
00:46:25,199 --> 00:47:24,549
The Great Northern Hotel.
