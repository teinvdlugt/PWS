1
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,417
One of Norma's breakfasts.
Made special.

2
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,798
God bless Norma.

3
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,843
Maybe later. Maybe later, thanks.

4
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,681
How's things at the station?

5
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,475
Earle's chess game
is the big concern.

6
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,020
The man has a poor sense
of recreation.

7
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,105
Yeah.

8
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,358
We're holding up, for now.

9
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,198
Hey, you and Cooper can handle it.
It's a pretty simple town.

10
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,118
Used to be.

11
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:30,083
I guess the world's
just caught up to us.

12
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,900
Annie.

13
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,030
- Hi.
- Hi.

14
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,368
Shelly, this is my sister, Annie.

15
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,580
Hi, Annie. Welcome.
Norma's told me all about you.

16
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:13,794
- All about me?
- Shelly's like family.

17
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,256
With our family, that's not exactly
a character reference.

18
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,259
How did you and Mom get along?

19
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,387
Well, we can talk about her,
or we can feel good about things.

20
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,264
I vote for plan B.

21
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,351
Me too. I'm glad you're here.

22
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,895
Feels a little strange. The real world.

23
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,815
Little things, like I'd almost forgotten
how to use money.

24
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,193
Closest we'd get in the convent
was bingo chips.

25
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,781
No charity, Norma. Promise.

26
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,535
Don't worry,
I'm gonna work you till you drop.

27
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,999
Compelling.

28
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,024
Harry's about to hit bottom.

29
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,609
Is he eating?

30
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,990
When do you think
he'll come back to work?

31
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,909
I guess we'll find out soon.

32
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,911
Need a hand?

33
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,080
That's a question
I should be asking you.

34
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,041
You're the senior lawman, Cooper.

35
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,544
Let's just let the rain fall
as it has been.

36
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,255
Besides, I hate paperwork.

37
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:44,551
This is worse than the Bureau,
with all its international documentation.

38
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,721
Eckhardt, Josie...

39
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,223
This is the autopsy on her.

40
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,477
Doc Hayward said
he couldn't determine cause of death.

41
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,563
The body only weighed 65 pounds.

42
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,317
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

43
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,570
Maybe something to do with
what I saw in the room when she died.

44
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,115
Maybe we'd better just whistle
on our way past the graveyard.

45
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,619
- Yeah.
- Anything on Earle?

46
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:17,000
Trail's stone-cold.
Still waiting for his response.

47
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,518
- Slip.
- Slippers.

48
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,024
You know, Leo,
you can't really appreciate

49
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:48,490
how tonic country life is
until you're actually right here, living it.

50
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,993
- Pipe?
- Splendid.

51
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,829
Mm.

52
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,623
Even if you've been
to the country before,

53
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,961
when you try to imagine
what it would be like to go back,

54
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,630
the image is imperfect.

55
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:08,427
The mental image
is always imperfect.

56
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,762
Am I right?

57
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,850
Tacit agreement is acceptable, Leo.

58
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:19,020
Your silence speaks volumes.

59
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:24,484
Or if not volumes, at least the
occasional unpunctuated paragraph.

60
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:33,034
Well, let's see what move our poor
Cooper's come up with this time.

61
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,582
Uh-huh.

62
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,343
This isn't a move.

63
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,221
This is a trick.

64
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,309
He's playing a stalemate game.

65
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:03,148
Cooper doesn't know
the meaning of stalemate!

66
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,194
He's getting help.

67
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:17,245
I cannot tolerate people
who do not play by the rules.

68
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,581
People who shirk the standards!

69
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:30,592
Many people are going to regret this.

70
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,672
Got it?

71
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,803
Ladies, may I say,

72
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:20,058
you'll both delightfully represent

73
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:24,396
the sanctity of nature.

74
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,606
Cigarette?

75
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,317
I prefer to keep my chest clear.

76
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,694
Ah.

77
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:34,447
The great god, fitness.

78
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,327
- Have you spoken with Pinkle?
- What's a Pinkle?

79
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,997
He's giving a talk
on the pine-weasel.

80
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,750
- The endangered animal.
- Oh, lovely.

81
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,003
What is it? A raccoon or something?

82
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,963
A ferret.

83
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,172
Audrey?

84
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,341
Oh, great.
You two should coordinate.

85
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,927
You are dreaming.

86
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,308
Hello.

87
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,852
Looks like you're trying
to run lumber upstream.

88
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,229
How can I help you, Mr. Wheeler?

89
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,024
Horne. Well, the talk
that we had at dinner.

90
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,318
- I can't...
- I'm sorry, I was rude, wasn't I?

91
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,154
It's just that when it comes
to my family, I get a little excitable.

92
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,282
- Who am I to waltz in out of nowhere?
- We need help. Anyone can see that,

93
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,535
and I can't think of anyone
better qualified for the job than you.

94
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,580
Hello?

95
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,374
What are we talking about, anyway?

96
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,543
I was apologizing
and you were apologizing.

97
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,880
We're both real sorry about something.
You wanna go out somewhere?

98
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,507
Bad time, right? It's not good?

99
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,176
Oh, no, no, it's great.

100
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,178
How about a picnic?

101
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:43,224
Uh-huh. Um, we need outdoors stuff.
A basket, blanket...

102
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,435
Food.

103
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,896
I don't know how to cook.

104
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,815
I'll bet you someone
in the kitchen does.

105
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,152
This is just to show people
what the pine-weasel looks like.

106
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,571
I understand the concept perfectly,
Mr. Dinkle.

107
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,281
Pinkle. The name is Pinkle.

108
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,910
But what I'm trying to make clear
is that using a stuffed animal

109
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,205
to represent an endangered species
as an ecological protest

110
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,542
constitutes the supreme incongruity.

111
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,380
Well, that's clear, Dick.

112
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,593
Harry?

113
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,388
Hey, Coop.

114
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,391
We got Josie's dossier
in from Interpol.

115
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,769
Not interested.

116
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,896
In addition to killing Eckhardt,
trying to kill me

117
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,482
- and killing Jonathan in Seattle...
- Closed cases.

118
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,860
...she's also wanted for a variety
of felonies in Hong Kong.

119
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,362
I don't need to hear this.

120
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,989
She's also had
two prostitution arrests, Harry.

121
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:56,256
Harry, eventually it's gonna help you
to know she was a hardened criminal.

122
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,341
A killer.

123
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,095
Get out of here.

124
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,431
I know it's not easy right now.

125
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,725
Just get out of here.

126
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,105
Get out of here! Go!

127
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,127
The door was open.

128
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:38,965
A country habit. We're all so trusting.

129
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,885
My name is Jones.

130
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,596
I was executive assistant
to the late Mr. Eckhardt.

131
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,643
Thank you.

132
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,491
I've come to expedite the transport
of his body back to Hong Kong.

133
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,873
Tragic, what happened.
You know, he really did love Josie.

134
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,167
Didn't we all?

135
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,420
They're going to be buried
side by side.

136
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,841
So they can keep an eye
on each other.

137
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,636
I guess you have your reasons
to be bitter.

138
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:29,015
Oh, just call me a healthy skeptic.

139
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,936
Now, why did you really
come to see me?

140
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,817
I came here to give you a gift.
May I?

141
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,860
I don't think so.

142
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,410
Slowly.

143
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,093
From Thomas.

144
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:10,014
I have a few things to tidy up.
Then I'll be leaving tonight.

145
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,726
Good luck, Mrs. Martell.

146
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:33,204
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Bill or Eileen Hayward.

147
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,249
Well, they're not here right now.
Can I help you?

148
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,668
Well, I'm Dr. Gerald Craig,

149
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,629
an old friend of Will's
from medical school.

150
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,883
And, well, you see,
I have a convention in Spokane,

151
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,596
and so I just thought I'd swing by
and surprise them.

152
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,097
Which daughter are you?

153
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,601
- Oh. Donna.
- Donna.

154
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,437
Would you like to come in,
Dr. Craig?

155
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,773
I'd appreciate that.

156
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,333
Can I get you something to drink,
Dr. Craig? A pop or something?

157
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,210
Thank you, no, no. Uh...

158
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,255
Is this your local paper?

159
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,174
Yeah. Pretty small town, huh?

160
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,719
Now, don't knock small towns
until you've lived in the city.

161
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,763
Donna, you know,

162
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:37,685
it seems like Will has found himself
a little piece of heaven here.

163
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:43,232
Now, don't you have two sisters?

164
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,569
- Yeah, they're younger than me.
- Are they both as beautiful as you?

165
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,738
Heh. Well, I don't know.

166
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,330
You know, your dad and I,
we used to sit around

167
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:01,167
and try to figure
how our lives would work out.

168
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:07,298
And it seems like he's come
a little closer to the mark than I have.

169
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,552
- You're in high school?
- Unfortunately.

170
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,389
- I felt exactly the same way.
- Heh.

171
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,225
You know, high school is difficult,
you know.

172
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,894
You have no idea
what you want to do with your life,

173
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,731
so it seems that absolutely none of it
applies to your life.

174
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,858
- You're right.
- Heh, heh.

175
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,611
Well, don't worry. It'll all work out.

176
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:33,366
For now, you just enjoy it
in all its absurdity.

177
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,284
Okay.

178
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:39,622
Oh, I have a small gift for your dad.

179
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:45,003
Now, can I trust you not to open it?

180
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,338
- Sure.
- Ha, ha.

181
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,632
You know, speaking of school,

182
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,594
Will and I graduated
30 years ago this month.

183
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:57,765
So I...
It's a small remembrance for him.

184
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,601
Well, I should be on my way.

185
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,647
Oh, this is the number
where I'm staying.

186
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,277
I hope to see you later, Donna.

187
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,279
Me too.

188
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,446
How are you holding up, Pete?

189
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:59,786
I've been through every
stalemate game in recorded history.

190
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:04,290
And I've jerry-rigged
a few of these country standoffs

191
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,584
that they don't write about in books.

192
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:11,130
But it's no use. I mean,
there isn't a stalemate game on earth

193
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:15,718
that you don't lose
at least a few foot soldiers.

194
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,678
I mean, the classic Herbstman.

195
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:22,934
You wind up with six pieces.
Now, I can improve on that.

196
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,438
But even if I get there in half the time
and wind up with 12,

197
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,735
that means six people die.

198
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,447
Do your best, Pete.

199
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,785
Windom Earle's genius carries with it
the vice of impatience.

200
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,497
He doesn't want pawns.
He wants royalty.

201
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:48,292
Protect those, particularly the queen,
and we can frustrate him.

202
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,962
You can't do that.

203
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,089
My students.

204
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:58,219
Mr. Martell, Andy moved his knight
without doing the little hook thing.

205
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,222
You don't have to do
the little hook thing. That's optional.

206
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:07,478
Andy, the knight
has to do the little hook thing.

207
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,982
- Every time?
- It's a privilege.

208
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,235
No one else gets to make that move.

209
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,530
Okay, Mr. Martell.

210
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:24,787
I guess some people don't know
quite as much as they think they do.

211
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,040
Check.

212
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,678
We thought it best
we come see you.

213
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,644
As you know,
that pattern on the back of my neck

214
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:52,356
appeared during
my experience with...

215
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,943
Of course,
no idea as to how it got there.

216
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,987
And you noticed it today?

217
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,574
My log noticed. I remember.

218
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,326
What do you remember, Margaret?

219
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,580
Look at the back of my leg.

220
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,886
I was 7 years old.

221
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,722
I went walking up in the woods,

222
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:30,478
and when I got back, I was told
that I had disappeared for a day.

223
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,564
All I could recall was a flash of light,

224
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,443
and that mark was on my leg.

225
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,571
We all three recall the light.

226
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,867
And also the call of the owl.

227
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,954
Yes, I remember.

228
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:53,334
The only other time I saw that sight
and heard that sound

229
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,837
was right before my husband died.

230
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,048
In the fire.

231
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:11,769
- I'm connecting with something.
- Yes.

232
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,771
What?

233
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,984
I don't know.

234
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,239
Oh, bury me not

235
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:29,036
On the old prairie
Where the coyotes howl

236
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,248
And the wind blows free

237
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:38,212
In a narrow grave
Six-by-3

238
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,799
Don't bury me now

239
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,177
On the lone prairie

240
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,055
Um...

241
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,350
No one's ever sung a song
to me before.

242
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,313
You must have been serenaded
at least once or twice.

243
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,734
I don't inspire much singing.

244
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,195
Most boys are afraid.

245
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,990
Well, they don't know you, then.

246
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,410
Not really.

247
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,747
I don't think
anybody really knows me.

248
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,126
It sounds like a warning.

249
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,170
I know.

250
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,256
If there's another guy...

251
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:30,264
There was someone,
but not anymore.

252
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,308
There's nobody.

253
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,854
So, what do you wanna do now?

254
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,942
Know anymore cowboy tricks?

255
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,154
If you've got a lariat
in that picnic basket,

256
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,906
I could lasso passing cattle.

257
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,284
I don't think there's a cow for miles.

258
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,662
Stray dogs, raccoons,
birds, weasels.

259
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,316
You had a visitor.

260
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,026
Who's that?

261
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:28,614
Somebody you went to medical school
with named Gerald Craig.

262
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:33,327
Gerald Craig?
That's not possible, Donna.

263
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,623
Well, yeah. He said he was on his way
to a convention in Spokane.

264
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,125
He knew everything about me.

265
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,885
Here's his number, and this.

266
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,852
Gerald Craig was my roommate.

267
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,105
He drowned on a rafting trip
on the Snake River.

268
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,275
I was there, Donna.
I tried to save him.

269
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,734
Well, then...

270
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,655
It's a cemetery.

271
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,583
Knight to King's Bishop 3.

272
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,464
That man, he's very dangerous.

273
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,591
Don't let him in here again,
do you understand?

274
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:32,761
- Sure.
- I've gotta take this to Cooper.

275
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:45,107
Nadine, what I'm here
to say to you is, uh...

276
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,279
Seeing how you're with Mike now...

277
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:54,116
It's so cute the way
you get embarrassed.

278
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:59,079
And, uh,
since I have found someone else...

279
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,625
Nadine, I'm not sure
you're gonna understand this.

280
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,419
Of course I understand, Eddie.

281
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,756
This isn't just a little spat.

282
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,509
Nadine, um,

283
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,637
do you know
what Ed is suggesting?

284
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:20,059
It's not too obvious.
We're not, like, talking relativity here.

285
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:24,605
We're breaking up.
Major, final breakup.

286
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:29,777
Well, yes, technically,
I guess it is a breakup, but, uh...

287
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,696
Well, it's a little more
than that, Nadine.

288
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:36,200
Ed, you are so serious.

289
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,411
These are the dating years.

290
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:43,040
You're acting like
this is some really big deal.

291
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,625
Doc?

292
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:50,756
Ed, there are no secret tricks
or magic words.

293
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:56,136
It's like the dissolving
of scar tissue around a wound.

294
00:25:56,304 --> 00:26:02,017
She'll start to see reality again
when her mind begins to feel safe.

295
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,353
Well, when will that be?

296
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,272
I can't say.

297
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,024
That tissue's packed in there
pretty hard.

298
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:14,029
Okay. Well, one thing
I really don't wanna see, Ed,

299
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:19,910
are any incidents with Mike.
No jealous rages.

300
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,914
Well, maybe just one.

301
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,083
I give up.

302
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:35,342
Nadine, you and Ed
are about to get a divorce.

303
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:43,851
I think I've gone blind in my left eye.

304
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,864
- Shelly?
- Yeah.

305
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,034
Have you seen this?

306
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,870
Oh, "Miss Twin Peaks."

307
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,833
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

308
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,461
There's a cash prize
and a scholarship.

309
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,673
- I bet you could walk away with it.
- I don't think so.

310
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,967
It's easy, you give a speech,
you answer a few questions...

311
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,304
Miss Double R Diner,

312
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:06,141
what would you do
to bring about world peace?

313
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:10,813
Well, I would
bring all the world leaders together,

314
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,149
make them form a circle
and join hands.

315
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,818
Because you can't make a fist

316
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,861
- holding hands.
- You're a shoo-in.

317
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,156
I have an order up.

318
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,002
Here's your burger.

319
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,046
What's with the dance?

320
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:40,592
Oh, heh, my boss told me I should
enter a pageant. Miss Twin Peaks.

321
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:45,347
You can kid about it,
but you are very pretty.

322
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,974
I think you should enter it.

323
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,018
Thanks, but I don't think
of myself as pretty.

324
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,187
It's an inner thing, you know.

325
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,955
Would you like something to drink?

326
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:15,586
Yes, I'd like a cup
of deep black joe, please.

327
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,963
Coming right up.

328
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,182
You must be Norma's sister.

329
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,017
I'm Annie.

330
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,937
- How did you know?
- Dale Cooper. Local law enforcement.

331
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,732
Must keep you pretty busy.

332
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,609
Sure does.

333
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,531
Are you, uh,
staying in town for a while?

334
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,533
I might be here quite a while.

335
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,911
It's happened to me.

336
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,913
Looks like it's grown on you.

337
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,248
It has a way of doing that.

338
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,472
I made it a little strong.

339
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,974
Okay.

340
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,739
You made it just right, Annie.

341
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,424
We've got a problem
at the Book House.

342
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,136
Agent Cooper, Hawk,
the sheriff's gone off.

343
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,848
He's broken every piece
of furniture not nailed down.

344
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,891
I honestly don't know what to do.

345
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,185
It's okay, Andy.

346
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,736
Hey, Deputy Dale.

347
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,947
How's business?

348
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,451
Well, Harry,
it's a little complicated at the moment.

349
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:16,874
That's the good thing about the law.
It doesn't breathe. You can't kill it!

350
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,925
Harry, I've got an idea.

351
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,012
Why don't you hand me that gun?

352
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:43,483
I don't believe I've ever handed my gun
over to anybody in my entire life!

353
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:48,030
This might be
a damn fine time to start.

354
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,620
You know something else
I've never done?

355
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,083
I've never crossed the ocean.

356
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,922
Never got to China.

357
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,761
She came to me.

358
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,806
And she made everything better.

359
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,937
Everything so much better.

360
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,651
Harry.

361
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:30,405
Your life is still your own.
Josie didn't take that with her.

362
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,616
I should have gotten her away.

363
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,744
I should have
taken her away from here!

364
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,417
I loved her.

365
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,965
She didn't have to die.

366
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,067
I don't understand.

367
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,947
There's a whole lot
I don't understand.

368
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,201
We're all like that.

369
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,344
Have somebody keep an eye
on him tonight.

370
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,888
I've never seen him like this.

371
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,808
It was like taking a hike
to your favorite spot

372
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,978
and finding a hole
where the lake used to be.

373
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,439
Josie had power.

374
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:50,569
A man who doesn't love easily
loves too much.

375
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:54,156
- A good man.
- The best.

376
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,242
Keep going.

377
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,334
That's a special honeymoon suite
for Mr. and Mrs. Hinkman?

378
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,670
Uh, that's correct. Yes.

379
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,505
We're from Bozeman originally.

380
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:14,718
But my wife thought that it would be
nice to see the countryside.

381
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,138
And, you know, you have some
very pretty country here in Twin Peaks.

382
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,224
- Will you be with us long?
- Not long enough.

383
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:27,481
No, just until tomorrow if that's okay,
because we're going deep-sea fishing.

384
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,274
Oh, goody.

385
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,360
Okay, so we'll just be
going on up now, me and...

386
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,988
- Me and Mrs. Hinkman.
- Oh, is that Mike?

387
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,995
Susan, uh, how are you?

388
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,332
Fine. Um...

389
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,834
I'll see you at school.

390
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,508
The room, please.

391
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,719
I think we can handle the bags.

392
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,434
First of all,

393
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:10,357
I would like to thank all of you
for this marvelous turnout.

394
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,818
It's very gratifying to see
so many people

395
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:18,782
who are sincere
about their environment.

396
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:24,538
The Stop Ghostwood campaign
is a determined effort

397
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:28,750
to keep the rabid development
interests from trying to turn

398
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:33,755
our beautiful Northwest forests
into a monstrous amusement park,

399
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:39,302
destroying animal preserves which
have been undisturbed for centuries.

400
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,931
The little worlds
that serve as sanctums

401
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,518
for several endangered species,

402
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:53,024
not the least of which
is the little pine-weasel.

403
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,486
Before moving along,

404
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:04,369
I would just like to remind all of us
that ecology is not a luxury science.

405
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,789
It is not about pleasant appearances.

406
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,835
It is about survival.

407
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:19,301
About whether we are all
going to make it, period.

408
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:26,933
But not to understate the value
of visual pleasure,

409
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:31,313
we come to the fashion show.

410
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,651
Now, if any of you think you recognize
some of the models,

411
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,988
it's because they are concerned
members of the community

412
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,532
who have graciously given
of their time tonight.

413
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,369
So, ladies and gentlemen,
to kick things off, here is our host,

414
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,163
Richard Tremayne.

415
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:57,005
Thank you. Splendid gathering.

416
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,842
Our little Lucy
is wearing a delightful

417
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:05,722
mix of warm Northern comfort
and Southern insouciance.

418
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:11,144
An elegant worsted wool jacket
over a plethora of plaid,

419
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,189
with a hint of polka dot.

420
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:19,152
It's fabulous, isn't it?
A moonless night, black, slim skirt

421
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,783
with a look that always says,
"Hey, world, I'm here."

422
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:40,215
Mr. Brennan is wearing
a fire-engine-red turtleneck

423
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,969
beneath an all-wool plaid
Pendleton shirt.

424
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:49,140
He completes this look with his
red-and-black buffalo-checked jodhpurs.

425
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,393
For the man who wants
to make a statement

426
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,065
while retaining that casual feel,
whether he's out mastering a task

427
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:01,361
or riding the breeze
of a chance meeting.

428
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,281
That's it, Andy.

429
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,583
At this rate, we're running late.
So if we could all

430
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,837
sort of hurry Richard along
with some quick movement out there.

431
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,046
I'm hot in this thing.

432
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:24,843
You're hot? I'm dressed like a sheep.
All this worsted.

433
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,344
And I think Mr. Tremayne

434
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,180
is getting more than a little hot
with all these girls.

435
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,100
- Our next model...
- Go, go, go.

436
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:38,023
Well, if it isn't John Muir,
friend of the redwoods.

437
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,443
Catherine, how good of you to come.

438
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:45,155
Ben, darling,
who are you kidding with all this?

439
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:50,035
I am absolutely 100 percent sincere.

440
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,663
Oh, come on.
Look who you're talking to.

441
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,000
We're in the same line of work.

442
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:02,630
You've always been
a little more obvious, but this...

443
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:07,302
Catherine, ahem, have you ever,
in your entire life,

444
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,847
had an experience
that truly changed you?

445
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:15,143
Please, spare me the born-again
sales pitch and level with me.

446
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,854
You can't hope to stop
my development plans,

447
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,565
so, what do you actually expect
to gain from all this?

448
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,861
A first scrubbing

449
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:30,075
on one of the dirtiest consciences
in the entire Northwest.

450
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:34,204
And hopefully, it will happen to you.

451
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,414
Catherine,

452
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:42,003
I know what your plans
for Ghostwood are.

453
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:46,883
And granted, I used to see life
exactly the way you do.

454
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:52,305
And no matter how many deals
I made or how much money I made,

455
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:58,186
inside, I was still a black,
miserable clod of dirt.

456
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:03,733
I am finding that the one thing
that really affords you joy in life,

457
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:08,321
the only authentic thing, is giving.

458
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:13,701
Don't wait until you're on
your deathbed to find that out.

459
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,413
God help you.

460
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,124
You actually sound like you mean it.

461
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:27,757
I do. For you, for me, the future.

462
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:34,347
Catherine,
why don't you take this opportunity

463
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:39,936
to transcend a lifetime
of megalomania and egocentricity,

464
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:44,399
and write us a big fat check
to help stop Ghostwood?

465
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,076
Mwah.

466
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,669
And now to introduce you
to an endangered little critter

467
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,504
whose home
is presently under attack

468
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:11,843
by the proposed Ghostwood
development project, Mr. Tim Pinkle.

469
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:17,765
Thank you, Dick.
Thank you, thank you.

470
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:24,022
Well, hi, how's everything going?

471
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,652
That's good.

472
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,574
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
I have with me a little fellow

473
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:39,496
who doesn't understand
the peril that awaits him.

474
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,708
An innocent in a world gone mad.

475
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:47,504
A world gone mad. Ahem.

476
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:51,841
Without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

477
00:41:54,303 --> 00:42:01,059
I give you
the endangered pine-weasel.

478
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,647
Now, this species
is of the weasel family.

479
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:13,112
And not only is he nonaggressive
to us humans and has beautiful fur,

480
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,202
but also, he is by nature
an excellent controller of rodents.

481
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:24,165
Unfortunately, this little friendly fellow
is incredibly curious,

482
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,919
making him very easy
for one to trap.

483
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:32,298
He is also attracted to bright
shiny objects.

484
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:36,052
- Must be my studs.
- Yeah. Oh. Oh.

485
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,514
It also is amazing,
he is particularly attracted

486
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:43,476
to various smells, like, believe it or not,
very cheap cologne.

487
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,562
Oh, what's this?

488
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,730
I think it wants
to give you a kiss, Dick.

489
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,275
- Oh, please, Mr. Pinkle.
- Come on. Come on.

490
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,822
- It's all right, give him a kiss.
- A kiss?

491
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,701
Uh-huh. Attaboy. Come on.

492
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,703
Hello there, little pilgrim...

493
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,292
Oh, no, no, no.

494
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,136
Nobody panic. Don't panic.
He's completely harmless.

495
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,470
He's already endangered.

496
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,445
Don't panic, anybody,
just don't panic.

497
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,947
- Nobody panic.
- Please, everyone, calm down.

498
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,491
- Stay in your seat.
- Aah!

499
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,038
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

500
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,081
Lot of fuss over a loose weasel.

501
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,626
- Maybe we should help.
- I don't know.

502
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,503
A little excitement
might do this crowd some good.

503
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:57,342
- Did you come for the fashion show?
- No, I came for you.
