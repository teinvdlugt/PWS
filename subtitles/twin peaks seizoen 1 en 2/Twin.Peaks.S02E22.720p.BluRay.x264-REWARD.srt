1
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,479
Were you afraid, Punky?

2
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:50,651
I was on the stage at the Roadhouse,
and the lights went out.

3
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,194
I kept thinking:

4
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,696
"The lights are going out,
the lights are going out."

5
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,074
And then they did.

6
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,285
And it all went black,
and I kept thinking:

7
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,412
"It's so dark,
what about hand signals?

8
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,623
What good would they do us now?

9
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,335
And the baby, what if the lights
went out in the hospital

10
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,046
and we were in the elevator?"

11
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,383
Then I'd help you have that baby
right there in the elevator,

12
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,761
in front of God and everybody.

13
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,854
- I love you.
- I love you.

14
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,456
Coop, I've got deputies
from three counties looking for Earle.

15
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,292
He seems to have
completely disappeared.

16
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,335
Harry, the only hope we have
of finding them

17
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,172
is somewhere in this map.

18
00:02:55,842 --> 00:03:00,053
Giant, little man,

19
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:05,184
fire, fire walk with me.

20
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,775
Fire walk with me.

21
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,865
Grand theft auto.

22
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:27,080
The Log Lady stole my truck.

23
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,961
'68 Dodge pickup.

24
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,546
Powder blue.

25
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,049
I tried to chase after her,
but she took off

26
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,593
on the road up towards the woods.

27
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,973
Pete, the Log Lady
did not steal your truck.

28
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,477
The Log Lady will be here
in one minute.

29
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,398
The woods, Harry,

30
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,903
- Ghostwood forest.
- Ghostwood?

31
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:05,744
Twelve rainbow trouts in the bed.

32
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,412
Twelve.

33
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,791
Wait a doggone minute.

34
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,627
There's a circle of 12 sycamores.

35
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,129
Glastonbury Grove.

36
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,923
Sycamores.

37
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,677
That's where I found the bloody towel
and the pages of the diary.

38
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:27,015
The legendary
burial place of King Arthur.

39
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,767
Glastonbury.

40
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:33,146
King Arthur's buried in England.

41
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,528
Well, last I heard anyway.

42
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,825
Right on time.

43
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,869
It's the Log Lady.

44
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,711
Where's my truck?

45
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,339
Pete, Windom Earle stole your truck.

46
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,095
I brought the oil.

47
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,930
Thank you, Margaret.

48
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:11,268
It sure looked to me like you.

49
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,021
Margaret,

50
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,983
what did your husband
say exactly about this oil?

51
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,655
He brought it back one night
just before he died and said:

52
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:28,160
"This oil is an opening to a gateway."

53
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,748
Intriguing, isn't it?

54
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,008
Jacoby.

55
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,802
- Scorched engine oil.
- Scorched engine oil.

56
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,556
Hawk, bring in Ronette Pulaski.

57
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,397
Ronette, thanks for coming in.

58
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,193
Do you recognize this smell?

59
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,412
Yes.

60
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,500
The night Laura Palmer was killed.

61
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,977
Glastonbury Grove.

62
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,981
I am Windom Earle.

63
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,775
Windom Earle?

64
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,405
Take a look at that.

65
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,658
Twelve rainbow trout.

66
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,285
If you're gonna kill me,
get it over with.

67
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,329
There's plenty of time for that.

68
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:58,083
But I do like the fear I'm feeling.

69
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,514
Our bones are scattered
at the grave's mouth,

70
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,266
as when one cutteth
wood upon the earth.

71
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,226
But mine eyes are unto thee,
O God the Lord:

72
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,769
in thee is my trust;
leave not my...

73
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,813
Keep me from the snares
they have laid for me,

74
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,648
and the gins of the workers
of iniquity.

75
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,777
Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
whilst that I withal escape.

76
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,823
What are we doing here?

77
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,044
You and I have an appointment
at the end of the world.

78
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,133
- He'll come for me.
- No, he won't.

79
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,761
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Same thing happened last time.

80
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,014
When he fell in love with my wife.

81
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,184
I took the boy right to the edge
that time.

82
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:02,105
Come in, come in to the circle!

83
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,112
I tell you, they have not died.

84
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,784
Their hands clasp, yours and mine.

85
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,168
You'll not run from me now,

86
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,089
not in this circle of trees.

87
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,719
You'll come with me.

88
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,795
Remember, 20 minutes on
and 20 minutes off with the ice bag.

89
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,214
It'll help with the swelling,
both of you.

90
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,718
Take some aspirin,
call me in the morning.

91
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,430
Thanks, doc.

92
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,018
Oh. Does it hurt much, baby?

93
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,854
God, Nadine,
I was so worried about you.

94
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,857
I admit there were times
when I had my doubts

95
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:33,572
about what we meant to each other,
but seeing that sandbag hit you,

96
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,449
I just knew

97
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,036
I'd practically do anything for you.

98
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,372
And then the tree hit me.

99
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,129
I love you.

100
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:58,096
There, I've said it and I'm glad.

101
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,397
Who are you?

102
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,566
Mike.

103
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,736
You...

104
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:18,950
You try to...
You say your name is Mike?

105
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,037
What are you doing in my house?

106
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,707
You brought me here, Nadine.

107
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,959
No!

108
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,420
No, you get out of here!

109
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,716
Ed, make him go away.

110
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,719
What's she doing here?

111
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,681
Oh.

112
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,268
It's not fair.

113
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,397
Please...

114
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,733
Ed, make...

115
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,245
Where are my drape runners?
Where are my drape runners?

116
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,831
Nadine, how old are you?

117
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,626
What kind of a stupid question
is that?

118
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,504
Answer me. How old are you?

119
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,049
Thirty-five, you moron!

120
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,602
I'm sorry, Ed.

121
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,690
I think I let things
get a little out of hand.

122
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,734
Oh, no. No.

123
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,132
Donna, please.
Donna, please, listen.

124
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,509
- I've heard enough!
- Please, just let me explain.

125
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,011
- Donna...
- Leave me alone!

126
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,849
It isn't your parents' fault. It's mine.

127
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,394
My parents?
Who are my parents anyway?

128
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:14,733
I only wanted to do good.
I wanted to be good.

129
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:19,863
And it felt so good to tell the truth

130
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,783
after all these years.

131
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,624
Ben, damn it.

132
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,421
- Will.
- Donna.

133
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,299
Ben, I warned you.
Get out of my house.

134
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,718
Will,

135
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:47,849
can you forgive me
for what I have done to you?

136
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,652
Sylvia, I told you to stay home.

137
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,947
What are you trying to do
to this family?

138
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,786
Daddy, you're my daddy.
You're my daddy.

139
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,455
You're my daddy.

140
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,541
Daddy.

141
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,503
Leave my family alone!

142
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,338
Now, Will. Will!

143
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,964
- Will!
- Unh!

144
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,424
No!

145
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:50,829
Ah. I knew I'd seen it somewhere.

146
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,623
Safety deposit box.

147
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,755
They'll never notice the difference.

148
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,933
Oh, Andrew.

149
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,937
Good night, Pete.

150
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,804
Harry,

151
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,265
this way.

152
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,671
Coop?

153
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,348
Harry, I have to go on alone.

154
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,350
Why?

155
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,061
What?

156
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,257
Oh.

157
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,760
Sycamore trees.

158
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,409
An opening to a gateway.

159
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,001
Footprints.

160
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,266
My God.

161
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:52,713
Under the sycamore tree

162
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:40,511
And I'll see you

163
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:45,224
And you'll see me

164
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:50,730
And I'll see you in the branches

165
00:19:50,898 --> 00:20:01,032
That blow in the breeze

166
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:17,506
I'll see you in the trees

167
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:32,021
Under the sycamore tree

168
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:10,518
Sheriff Truman?

169
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,521
Andy! Over here!

170
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:57,231
Been about ten hours
since he went in there.

171
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,824
Do you want a thermos of coffee?

172
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,414
Yeah.

173
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:19,879
Do you want a plate special?

174
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,886
Yeah.

175
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,933
Do you want dessert?

176
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,982
Yeah.

177
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,862
Do you want pie?

178
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:55,081
Harry?

179
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,471
- Morning, Mr. Mibbler.
- Audrey Horne.

180
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:15,351
This is my fortunate day.

181
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,275
Is there anything I can do for you?

182
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:27,154
As a matter of fact, there is.
You can call the Twin Peaks Gazette.

183
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,994
Ask to speak
with Dwayne Milford Jr.

184
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,663
- Dwayne?
- The editor.

185
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,456
Eh?

186
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:42,253
Heh.
We must make a telephone call.

187
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,928
- Uh, yes?
- Yes.

188
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,515
Tell him that Audrey Horne
has chained herself

189
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,268
to the Twin Peaks
Savings and Loan vault

190
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,854
in protest of their financial ties

191
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,231
to the Ghostwood
Development Project.

192
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,527
And that I intend to stay here
until a town meeting is held

193
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,737
to debate the future
of our environment

194
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,992
and specifically the effect
of the Ghostwood Project upon it.

195
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,787
- Okay?
- Yeah, miss.

196
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,998
And can I get a glass of water,
please?

197
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,500
Uh... Uh...

198
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,756
Thank you, Dell.

199
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:41,205
You, you.

200
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,414
You!

201
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:46,794
Heh, heh. Dell Mibbler,
as I live and breathe.

202
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,754
He's alive.

203
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,714
But the funeral.

204
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:55,010
And all of the flowers,
and the choir boys.

205
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,138
I was hoping you could do
a small favor for me.

206
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,807
Does this look familiar to you?

207
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,936
Yes, it's one
of our safety deposit keys.

208
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:09,358
- Aha. Shall we?
- Well, of course.

209
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:15,239
But there is going to be
a bit of a problem.

210
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,952
A bit of a problem.

211
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,628
- Hi, Pete.
- Audrey?

212
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:33,215
Young lady, why are you
chained to the bank vault?

213
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,384
Civil disobedience.

214
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,845
Ah. Ha, ha.

215
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,181
Waste no time arguing
what a good man should be, be one.

216
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:45,227
Marcus Aurelius.
I admire your verve.

217
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:49,857
I see no problem here.
If you'll excuse us, please?

218
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,859
Sure.

219
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,453
Did you call the Gazette yet?

220
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:07,249
Maybe you should call the sheriff too.
Ask for Agent Cooper.

221
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,592
Give me the key.

222
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,349
A boy? It's a boy!

223
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,352
It's a boy, it's a boy.

224
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,773
- So long.
- So long.

225
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,279
We've come to the end
of a long road, Pete.

226
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,740
And here we are.

227
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,164
Oh, sh...!

228
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,270
Mm.

229
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:10,164
Shelly, I think we should get married.

230
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,457
Bobby.

231
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:18,088
Leo. I'm still wearing his ring.

232
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,183
Oh, what kept us, Heidi?

233
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,477
Seconds on knackwurst
this morning?

234
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,062
I couldn't get my car started.

235
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,399
Too busy jump-starting the old man.

236
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,942
- Again.
- Again.

237
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,822
I thought you Germans
were always on time.

238
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,083
- Shelly...
- Bobby.

239
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,504
Leo's probably up in the woods
having the time of his life.

240
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,597
Well, you were right,
there's the major.

241
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,607
Excuse us, Major Briggs,
for the intrusion,

242
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:23,237
but Sarah here had a message for you
that she thought was important.

243
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,364
Sarah.

244
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:43,382
I'm in
the Black Lodge with Dale Cooper.

245
00:30:55,436 --> 00:31:03,318
I'm waiting for you.

246
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:30,989
[DISTORTED

247
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,333
Whoo!

248
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,721
Caroline.

249
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:49,279
Annie.

250
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,701
Annie!

251
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,790
Annie. Annie.

252
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:10,550
Annie?

253
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,418
Annie,

254
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,547
the face of the man who killed you?

255
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,053
Annie?

256
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,319
Caroline.

257
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,054
I will.

258
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:45,510
Cooper!

259
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,556
Annie!

260
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,767
Annie.

261
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,771
Annie!

262
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,207
There he is.

263
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,085
Coop?

264
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,506
I wasn't sleeping.

265
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,968
Annie, how's Annie?

266
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,970
She's gonna be just fine.

267
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,556
She's over at the hospital.

268
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,522
I need to brush my teeth.

269
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:43,651
Sure. Come on.

270
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,903
I'll help you up.

271
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,531
Take her easy now.

272
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,295
I need to brush my teeth.

273
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,547
Good idea.

274
00:48:55,766 --> 00:49:00,978
Coop?

275
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,866
Coop, are you okay?

276
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,786
Coop?

277
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:20,122
How is Annie? How's Annie?

278
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,582
How's Annie?

279
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,338
How's Annie? How's Annie?

280
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,093
How's Annie?
