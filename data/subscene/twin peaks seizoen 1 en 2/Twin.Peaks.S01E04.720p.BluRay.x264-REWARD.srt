1
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,514
Diane, 7:15 a.m.

2
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,933
I'll be heading to the sheriff's
after breakfast.

3
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,770
From there, we'll be going on
to Laura Palmer's funeral.

4
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,203
Good morning, Colonel Cooper.

5
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,124
Just "agent," Audrey. Special agent.

6
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,127
Special agent.

7
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,462
Would you care to join me
for breakfast?

8
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,093
- I'm in a hurry.
- For what?

9
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,848
Audrey, that perfume you're wearing
is incredible.

10
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,602
- Do you really think so?
- Yes, I do.

11
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,812
Please have a seat.

12
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,983
And would you write your name
down for me? Here.

13
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,360
Okay.

14
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,955
There's something
you'd like to tell me.

15
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,375
There is?

16
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:35,130
You slipped this note
underneath my door night before last.

17
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,340
I did?

18
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,847
I wanted to help you. For Laura.

19
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,142
You said you and Laura
weren't exactly friends.

20
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,811
We weren't friends, but I understood
her better than the rest.

21
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,150
- What is One-Eyed Jack's?
- It's a place up north.

22
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,360
Men go there.

23
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,111
What about women?

24
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,785
Women, you know, work there.

25
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,204
Did Laura work there?

26
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,415
I don't know.

27
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,709
Laura worked
at my father's department store.

28
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,837
- Horne's.
- He named it after himself.

29
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,839
Where
at Horne's Department Store?

30
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,677
At the perfume counter.

31
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,348
- So did Ronette Pulaski.
- Really?

32
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,309
Audrey, that rightward slant
in your handwriting

33
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,979
indicates a romantic nature.

34
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,898
A heart that yearns. Be careful.

35
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,484
I do?

36
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,785
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave now.

37
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,329
Police business.

38
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,626
Thank you for talking to me.

39
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,052
- Trudy, two more coffees, please.
- Mm.

40
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,471
Harry, Lucy.

41
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,350
It is an absolutely beautiful morning.

42
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,185
Short stack of griddlecakes,
melted butter,

43
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,104
maple syrup, lightly heated,
slice of ham.

44
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:18,442
Nothing beats the taste sensation
when maple syrup collides with ham.

45
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,153
Griddlecakes, slice of ham.

46
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,238
Who killed Laura Palmer?

47
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,992
Ahh.

48
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,037
Let me tell you
about the dream I had last night.

49
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,248
- Tibet?
- No.

50
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,958
You were there. Lucy, so were you.

51
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,963
Harry, my dream is a code
waiting to be broken.

52
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,715
Break the code, solve the crime.

53
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:48,138
"Break the code, solve the crime."

54
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,641
In my dream, Sarah Palmer
has a vision of her daughter's killer.

55
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,769
Deputy Hawk sketched his picture.

56
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,064
I got a phone call
from a one-armed man named Mike.

57
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,648
The killer's name was Bob.

58
00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,983
Mike and Bobby?

59
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,402
No. It's a different Mike
and a different Bob.

60
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,155
They lived
above a convenience store.

61
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,990
They had a tattoo:

62
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:11,036
Fire, walk with me.

63
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,331
Mike couldn't stand the killing
anymore, so he cut off his arm.

64
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,042
Bob vowed to kill again,
so Mike shot him.

65
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,795
Do you know
where dreams come from?

66
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,131
- Not specifically.
- No.

67
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,010
Acetylcholine neurons
fire high-voltage impulses

68
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,470
into the forebrain.

69
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,765
These impulses become pictures,
the pictures become dreams.

70
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,769
But no one knows why we choose
these particular pictures.

71
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,021
So, what was the end of this dream?

72
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,982
Suddenly, it was 25 years later.

73
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,151
I was old, sitting in a red room.

74
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,779
There was a midget
in a red suit and a beautiful woman.

75
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,865
The little man told me that my favorite
gum was coming back into style

76
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,702
and didn't his cousin look exactly
like Laura Palmer? Which she did.

77
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,330
- What cousin?
- The beautiful woman.

78
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,958
She's filled with secrets.

79
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,293
Sometimes her arms bend back.

80
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,587
Where she's from,
the birds sing a pretty song

81
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,048
and there's always music in the air.

82
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,383
The midget did a dance.

83
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,554
Laura kissed me and she whispered
the name of the killer in my ear.

84
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,180
Who was it?

85
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,016
I don't remember.

86
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,603
- Damn.
- Damn.

87
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,731
Harry, our job is simple.
Break the code, solve the crime.

88
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,110
Yeah?

89
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,071
Sheriff, I'm at the morgue
and there's a big fight going on.

90
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,407
You hang on. I'll be right there.

91
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,660
That was Andy.
There's a fight over at the morgue.

92
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,246
Albert.

93
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,582
You're the most cold-blooded
man I've ever seen.

94
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,293
I've never met a man
with so little regard for human frailty.

95
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,586
Have you no compassion?

96
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,921
I've got compassion
running out of my nose, pal.

97
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,090
I'm the sultan of sentiment.

98
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,426
Dr. Hayward,
I have traveled thousands of miles

99
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,179
and apparently several centuries
to this forgotten sinkhole

100
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,055
in order to perform a series of tests.

101
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,974
I do not ask you
to understand these tests.

102
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,184
I'm not a cruel man.

103
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,144
I just ask you
to get the hell out of my way

104
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,604
so I can finish. Is that clear?

105
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,315
We are here to conduct
Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery.

106
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,526
If you think we're gonna leave here
without her, you are out of your mind.

107
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:10,363
All right, all right, all right.

108
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,616
Mr. Rosenfield, please.

109
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:20,999
Now, uh, Leland Palmer
couldn't be with us today,

110
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,210
but I know I speak for everyone,

111
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,628
the Palmer family included,

112
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:30,759
when I say that, uh, we appreciate
and understand the value of your work.

113
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,386
But as their representative,

114
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:37,724
I must insist
that we consider the feelings

115
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,310
of the Palmer family as well.

116
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:44,231
Mr. Horne, I realize that your position
in this fair community

117
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,484
pretty well guarantees venality,
insincerity,

118
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,278
and a rather irritating method
of expressing yourself.

119
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,865
Stupidity, however,
is not a necessarily inherent trait.

120
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:58,745
Therefore, please listen closely.
You can have a funeral any old time.

121
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,664
You dig a hole, you plant a coffin.

122
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:04,000
I, however,
cannot perform these tests next year,

123
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,127
next month, next week or tomorrow.

124
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,588
I must perform them now.

125
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,675
I've got a lot of cutting
and pasting to do,

126
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,469
so why don't you return to your porch
rockers and resume whittling?

127
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,931
That does it.
I'm taking charge of the body.

128
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,724
You don't touch Laura
from this moment on.

129
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,560
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

130
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,061
- Gentlemen.
- Whoa!

131
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,398
- What's going on?
- Thank God.

132
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,527
Cooper, this old fool is obstructing
a criminal investigation. Cuff him.

133
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,488
He won't release Laura's body
for the funeral. He's not human.

134
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,032
- What's the holdup?
- Please, Cooper.

135
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,536
I do not suffer fools gladly
and fools with badges, never.

136
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,997
I want no interference
from this hulking boob. That clear?

137
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,625
I've had just about enough
of your insults.

138
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,669
Oh, yeah?

139
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,172
Well, I've had about enough of,
uh, morons and half-wits,

140
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,134
dolts, dunces, dullards
and dumbbells.

141
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,886
And you, chowderhead yokel,
you blithering hayseed,

142
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,555
you've had enough of me?

143
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,017
Yes, I have.

144
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,232
Ugh. Oh, that's nice.
How appropriate.

145
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,069
Wait in the car, Harry.

146
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,036
The old rustic sucker punch, huh?

147
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,663
- A hail of bullets would be nice.
- That's enough.

148
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,082
The sheriff didn't mean anything.

149
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,836
- He hit me.
- Well, I'm sure he meant to do that.

150
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,173
Albert, I want you to release this
girl's body to her family immediately.

151
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:37,677
I want your test results by noon.
Those are orders.

152
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,103
Thank you, Agent Cooper.

153
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,715
Invitation to Love.

154
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:20,303
Starring Martin Hadley as Chet,

155
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:26,518
Selena Swift as Emerald and Jade,

156
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,105
Evan St. Vincent
as Jared Lancaster

157
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:36,778
and Jason Dembo as Montana.

158
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,325
My darling daughter, Jade,

159
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,327
and Emerald,

160
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:49,499
because of my financial difficulties,
I have decided to end it all tonight.

161
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,001
I hope you can find the strength
to go on without me.

162
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,170
Your loving father, Jared.

163
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,924
- Uncle Leland?
- Daddy, it's Jade.

164
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,844
- Uncle Leland.
- Please. I know you're in there.

165
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,598
Madeleine?

166
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,813
Jade, what a surprise, I...

167
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,197
Maddy?

168
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,158
Is it you?

169
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,704
Uncle Leland,

170
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,833
I am so sorry.

171
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:54,689
I'm sure Hank appreciates
your unwavering devotion.

172
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,858
Your husband
has been a model prisoner,

173
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,236
an inspiration to guard
and inmate alike.

174
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,988
He greets the day with a smile

175
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,991
and confounds adversity
with a kind word.

176
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,411
Hank's parole hearing
is scheduled for tomorrow.

177
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:14,209
Barring unforeseen circumstance,
with your full support before the board,

178
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,337
he could be released
shortly thereafter.

179
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,380
Any questions?

180
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,425
No.

181
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,094
Will you help find the job
that Hank needs

182
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,181
to effect a successful parole?

183
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,726
- Yes.
- How exactly?

184
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,063
I own the Double R, Mr. Mooney.

185
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,439
Oh.

186
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,108
You're quite a girl, Norma.

187
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:44,113
I'll bet you get all kinds of Romeos
in here, uh, begging for favors.

188
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,949
How do you keep them
from your door?

189
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,536
I usually tell them
I have a homicidally jealous husband

190
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,038
who's doing three-to-five
for manslaughter,

191
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,751
but he expects to be a productive
member of society real soon.

192
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:01,381
Well, now, that should conclude
our session for today, Mrs. Jennings.

193
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,511
Look at that.

194
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,721
Ducks on the lake.

195
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,433
So fill me in on Leo Johnson.

196
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,270
Leo's one of those guys you keep
on a list and you keep your eye on.

197
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,481
So far, we haven't caught him
with his paws in the cookie jar.

198
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,111
Morning, Leo.

199
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,822
Who the hell is he?

200
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,158
This is Special Agent Cooper, FBI.

201
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,953
We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

202
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,414
So ask.

203
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,584
Leo, is that short for Leonard?

204
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,086
That's a question?

205
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,924
- Did you know Laura Palmer?
- No.

206
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,343
- How well did you know her?
- I said I didn't.

207
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,179
You're lying.

208
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,142
I knew who she was, all right?
Everybody did.

209
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,439
- Do you have a criminal record, Leo?
- Nothing. You can look it up.

210
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,357
Illegal U-turn, April 1986.

211
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,192
Drunk and disorderly,
November 1987.

212
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,614
September '88,
aggravated assault, charges dropped.

213
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,867
I paid my debt to society.

214
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,494
Where were you the night
of Laura Palmer's murder?

215
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,788
- Around midnight.
- On the road.

216
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,375
I called my wife, Shelly,
around that time from Butte, Montana.

217
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,837
- She'll confirm this?
- She will if you ask her.

218
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,022
Robbie.

219
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,400
This may be a good time
for a brief discussion.

220
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,239
You wanna talk about cigarettes?
Today?

221
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,909
No, but put it out.

222
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,912
It's a filthy habit,
especially for a varsity athlete.

223
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,095
Yeah,
I've attended my share of funerals.

224
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,138
Too many.

225
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,518
Any time a man dies in war,
he dies too soon.

226
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,605
Laura died too soon as well.

227
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,692
Yeah, she did.

228
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,987
But we have a responsibility
to the dead, Robert.

229
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,281
Responsibility
is the linchpin of our society.

230
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,367
Each man responsible
for his own actions,

231
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,454
each action contributing
to the greater good.

232
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:43,835
What's the good
of putting someone in the ground?

233
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,338
Well, it's man's way
of achieving closure.

234
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,716
In ceremony begins understanding,

235
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,594
and the will to carry on
without those we must leave behind.

236
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,179
Robert, in your life you must learn,

237
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,474
you will learn,
to carry on without them.

238
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,935
Great.

239
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,982
Now, I realize you experience
an ongoing disinclination

240
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,360
to enter fully
into meaningful exchange.

241
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,904
This leads to stalemate

242
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:16,325
and a desire on my part
to force certain wisdom upon you.

243
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,369
This isn't necessarily a bad thing.

244
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,581
Sometimes
it's the best course available.

245
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,085
Son, don't be afraid.

246
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,963
We'll all be there together.

247
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,175
Afraid of what?

248
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,469
Well, the funeral.

249
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,015
I'm not afraid of any damn funeral.

250
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,350
Afraid?

251
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,189
I can hardly wait.

252
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,858
Afraid?

253
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,945
I'm gonna turn it upside down!

254
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,114
Everybody ready?

255
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,541
Deputy Hawk.

256
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,920
Agent Cooper, there's no sign
of the man with one arm.

257
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,839
Keep trying.
He's out there somewhere.

258
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,592
If anyone can find him, Hawk can.

259
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,177
- He's a tracker?
- The best.

260
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,762
Oh.

261
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,140
Okay, Albert, what do you got?

262
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,434
Enough forensic spadework
to save your butt

263
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,062
and get mine out
of this godforsaken burg.

264
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,357
What do you got?

265
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:36,239
Okay, first of all, contents of envelope
found in Palmer diary, cocaine.

266
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,241
Toxicology results also positive.

267
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,327
Newsflash: the little lady had a habit.

268
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,745
Next, we've got fibers of twine

269
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,622
embedded in her wrists
and upper arms.

270
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,250
Two different kinds of twine.

271
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,794
Fibers of twine
found in the railroad car.

272
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,337
Matched the sample from her wrist.

273
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,965
The same twine was used to bind
the wrists of the Pulaski girl.

274
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,509
Conclusion: she was tied up twice

275
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,594
at different locations
on the night of her death.

276
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,763
Once here and once here.

277
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,223
Like this:

278
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,227
Sometimes my arms bend back.

279
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,896
Here we've got traces of pumice found
in standing water

280
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,273
outside the railroad car.

281
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,233
Soap, industrial strength.

282
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,569
I found identical particles
on the back of Laura's neck.

283
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,612
It's not her home-use brand.

284
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,364
My conclusion,

285
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:22,410
the killer washed his hands
and then leaned in for a kiss.

286
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,911
Like this:

287
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,456
Good Lord.

288
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:32,003
Uh, distinctive wounds found
on Laura's neck and shoulder

289
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,965
appear to be claw marks,
bites of some kind.

290
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,092
An animal.

291
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,804
Look, it's trying to think.

292
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,311
Finally, a small plastic fragment
from her stomach

293
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,189
partially dissolved by digestive acids.

294
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,982
I'm taking it back for reconstruction,

295
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,319
as the local facilities give new meaning
to the word "primitive."

296
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,906
I note with some interest
what appears to be the letter J.

297
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,992
Good work, Albert.

298
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,828
A couple more days with the body,
who knows what I might have found?

299
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,164
Sheriff, it's time.

300
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:15,087
Excuse us.
We have got a funeral to get to.

301
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,511
Cooper,
may I have a word with you alone?

302
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,643
There's one more item. It's a report
concerning the assault on my person

303
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,894
which you witnessed.

304
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,981
I think you'll find it's quite accurate.
Requires your signature.

305
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,985
Albert, I'm not gonna sign this.

306
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,946
What?

307
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,032
Albert, I hope you can hear me.

308
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,993
I have only been in Twin Peaks
a short time,

309
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:50,289
but in that time, I have seen decency,
honor and dignity.

310
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,958
Murder is not a faceless event here.

311
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,586
It is not a statistic to be tallied up
at the end of the day.

312
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,340
Laura Palmer's death has affected
each and every man, woman and child

313
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,884
because life has meaning here.
Every life.

314
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,886
That's a way of living
I thought had vanished.

315
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,556
But it hasn't, Albert.
It's right here in Twin Peaks.

316
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,520
Sounds like you've been snacking
on some of the local mushrooms.

317
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,897
With your behavior
towards these good people,

318
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,566
consider yourself lucky
I do not file a report of my own

319
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:22,071
that could bury you in a building
so deep you'd never see the sun.

320
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,419
Diane, it's 12:27 p.m.

321
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,713
I'd like you to look
into my pension-plan options

322
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,841
regarding
outside real-estate investment.

323
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,592
I may look into purchasing property

324
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,014
at what I assume
will be a very reasonable price.

325
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,042
Mm. Mm!

326
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,255
Love me?

327
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,466
You bet.

328
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,470
This a new one?

329
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,681
Yes.

330
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,642
Isn't it beautiful?

331
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,355
Oh.

332
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,232
How do I look?

333
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,612
Well, you look fine, Nadine.

334
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,782
Oh, Ed.

335
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:51,410
Last night was wonderful.

336
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:57,083
Oh, my darling Ed,
you came back to me.

337
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:02,004
Now I feel
like we're really together again.

338
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,725
Ed, in high school,

339
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:22,358
I used to watch Norma and you
at those football games.

340
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,611
She was so pretty.

341
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,824
And you made
such a handsome couple.

342
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,118
But I knew,

343
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:38,374
even though I was just

344
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,002
a little nobody,

345
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:48,175
just a little brown mouse,

346
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:55,307
I always knew inside,

347
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,437
once you got to know me,

348
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,107
we'd be together forever.

349
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:11,198
That's not your bike, is it, Ed?

350
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,576
It's James.

351
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,746
James who?

352
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,125
Oh.

353
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,761
We don't wanna be late.
Are you ready?

354
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,055
I'm not going.

355
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,850
It's Laura, James.

356
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,768
I can't.

357
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,937
I just can't.

358
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,147
James.

359
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,196
I don't care what the doctor says.

360
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,240
If you keep indulging him this way,
he is never going to change.

361
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,367
I don't think we should be
discussing this

362
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,827
while Johnny's in the room.

363
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,996
Johnny doesn't
even know what day it is.

364
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,332
- We have to be patient.
- You be patient.

365
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,961
I have been waiting 20 years
for some sign of intelligent life.

366
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,595
I'm clear about this, Sylvia.
I have my limits.

367
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,138
Don't I know it.

368
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,141
My, let's all spray venom
in my general direction.

369
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,477
You take it with no problem.

370
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,646
Taking it is the specialty of the house.

371
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:27,566
Sylvia, I'm going to make it
extremely simple for you.

372
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,611
We can't take Johnny
to the funeral in that ridiculous getup.

373
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,613
Let Dr. Jacoby see what he can do.

374
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,323
We gotta go.

375
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,574
No, no.

376
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,785
You do it, then.

377
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,870
Am I going to have to call Dr. Jacoby

378
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,083
every damn time
I have a problem with Johnny?

379
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,013
Oh, thank God.

380
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,642
All right,
let's everyone just get into the car.

381
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:21,453
I am the resurrection and the life.

382
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:27,084
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

383
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:32,506
And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me shall never die.

384
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:38,137
For none of us liveth to himself,
and no man dieth to himself.

385
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,682
For if we live, we live unto the Lord.

386
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,644
And if we die, we die unto the Lord.

387
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,480
Whether we live, therefore,
or we die,

388
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,233
we are the Lord's.

389
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:55,070
Blessed be the dead
who die in the Lord,

390
00:26:55,238 --> 00:27:00,743
even so sayeth the Spirit,
for they rest from their labors.

391
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,078
The Lord be with thee.

392
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,582
Let us pray.

393
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:13,589
O God, entrust this child, Laura,
to thy never-failing care and love,

394
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,425
and bring us all
to thy heavenly kingdom,

395
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,845
through the same,
thy son, Jesus Christ our Lord,

396
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:24,099
who liveth and reigneth with thee
and the Holy Spirit.

397
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:29,229
One God, now and forever. Amen.

398
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,691
I baptized Laura Palmer.

399
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,736
I instructed her in Sunday school.

400
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,074
And I, like the rest of you,
came to love her

401
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:47,122
with that special love that we reserve
for the headstrong and the bold.

402
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,542
Laura was bright.

403
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:56,465
She was beautiful,
she was charming.

404
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:01,887
But most of all,
Laura was, I think, impatient.

405
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,140
She was impatient
for her life to begin,

406
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:10,312
for the world to finally catch up
to her dreams and ambitions.

407
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,981
Laura used to say
that I talked too much.

408
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,193
I'll not make that mistake today.

409
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:20,322
Just let it be said that I loved her,

410
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,659
and I will miss her
the rest of my days.

411
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,285
Amen.

412
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,123
Amen.

413
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,669
Thank you, Johnny.

414
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,755
Amen!

415
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,806
What are you looking at?

416
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,476
What are you waiting for?

417
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,937
You make me sick.

418
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,775
You damn hypocrites make me sick!

419
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:01,196
Everybody knew she was in trouble.

420
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,866
But we didn't do anything.

421
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,911
All you good people.

422
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,123
You wanna know who killed Laura?

423
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,459
You did!

424
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,795
We all did.

425
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,384
And pretty words aren't gonna bring
her back, man, so save your prayers.

426
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,470
She would've laughed
at them anyway.

427
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:36,565
You are dead, man. You're dead.

428
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,030
That's enough, Bobby.
That's enough.

429
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:50,537
You're dead!

430
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,915
Get off me.

431
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,834
You're a dead man. Dead.

432
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,006
You're dead, man. Gah! Dead.

433
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,425
That's enough. Come on.

434
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,427
Get off me.

435
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,221
Agh!

436
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,892
My baby. Laura.

437
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,147
Laura, no.

438
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,982
- Hang on.
- Can you reach him?

439
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,527
No...

440
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,112
The whole thing has gone haywire.

441
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,287
Don't ruin this too.

442
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,920
My baby.

443
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,129
Laura.

444
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,138
Laura.

445
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,992
So here's the guy, right.
He was the father.

446
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,661
And this is his daughter in the coffin.
He goes, boom!

447
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,842
I'm telling you, Harry,
he's just not gonna figure this out.

448
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,679
Ed, that's a bet I'll take
for the check.

449
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,890
He's right on time.

450
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,350
Harry, careful who you trust.
He's just not one of us.

451
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,519
Cooper, take a seat.

452
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,940
Harry, I got your note. Hawk, Big Ed.

453
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:46,278
How would you like
some fresh huckleberry pie?

454
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,697
I would love a slice of pie.

455
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,366
Norma, slice of huckleberry pie,
heated,

456
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,118
vanilla ice cream on the side, coffee.

457
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,495
Coming right up.

458
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,043
Big Ed, how long you been in love
with Norma?

459
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,343
Ed, looks like pie and coffee's
on you.

460
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,764
Okay, what did you call me in
to talk about

461
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,099
besides the highlights
of the dinner menu?

462
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,392
You better tell him.

463
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,647
Somebody's running drugs into
Twin Peaks from across the border.

464
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,149
We've been working this
for months, trying to set up a bust.

465
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,361
- Top to bottom. Nobody walks.
- Who's targeted?

466
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,363
Jacques Renault,
bartender at the Roadhouse.

467
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,157
We figure him for the middleman.

468
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,867
Now, Ed's been doing
some undercover.

469
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,037
In fact, the night you got into town,
he was staking Renault out.

470
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,164
We think Renault
slipped him a mickey.

471
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,500
Felt like somebody hit me
with a log splitter.

472
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,085
Ed, I didn't know you were a deputy.

473
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:44,920
He's not.

474
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,882
Well, it's a little outside
your jurisdiction, don't you think?

475
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,635
Somebody's selling drugs
to high school kids,

476
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,762
and I figure
that's everybody's jurisdiction.

477
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,765
I call Ed in when I need him.

478
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,100
He's not the only one I call.

479
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,108
- Thanks, Norma.
- Enjoy.

480
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,987
Mm.

481
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:14,449
This must be where pies go
when they die.

482
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:21,623
Okay, Harry, would you please tell me
why you really called me in here?

483
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,542
You're gonna have to go
along with me on this

484
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,293
even if it sounds a little weird.

485
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,255
- I'm with you.
- Twin Peaks is different.

486
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,465
A long way from the world.
You've noticed that.

487
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,509
Yes, I have.

488
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,511
And that's exactly the way we like it.

489
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:40,142
But there's a back end to that
that's kind of different too.

490
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,644
Maybe that's the price we pay
for all the good things.

491
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:47,149
- What would that be?
- There's a sort of evil out there.

492
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:52,362
Something very, very strange
in these old woods.

493
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,573
Call it what you want:

494
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,075
a darkness, a presence.

495
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,869
It takes many forms,

496
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:03,290
but it's been out there
for as long as anyone can remember.

497
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,625
And we've always been here
to fight it.

498
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,502
We?

499
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,005
Men before us.

500
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,591
Men before them.

501
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,676
More after we're gone.

502
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,179
A secret society.

503
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,349
Why don't we take Agent Cooper
for a little ride?

504
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,019
- Where to?
- The Bookhouse.

505
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,658
This is where we get together.

506
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,536
Going on 20 years now.

507
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,830
"We" meaning?

508
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,708
The Bookhouse Boys.

509
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:50,170
- Coffee's free.
- Like the sound of that.

510
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,009
Cooper, you know James.

511
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,179
- Agent Cooper.
- James.

512
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,307
- This is Joey Paulson.
- Joey.

513
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,600
Who's this?

514
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,811
Bernard Renault, Jacques' brother.

515
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,647
Janitor at the Roadhouse.

516
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,565
Bernard came across the border
this morning

517
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,819
with an ounce of cocaine
in his kit bag.

518
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,738
Thought we'd ask him
a few questions.

519
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,661
Did you ever sell drugs
to Laura Palmer?

520
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,080
I don't sell drugs.

521
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,499
How much does Jacques pay you
to be the mule?

522
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:31,086
Jacques don't pay me nothing.
I'm no mule.

523
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,755
So that ounce you had,
that was for personal use?

524
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,215
That's right.

525
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,093
Guess you don't get a whole lot
of sleep at night, then, huh, Bernie?

526
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,179
Your brother didn't come into work
the last few days. Where's he been?

527
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,098
I don't know.

528
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,766
He got personal business.

529
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,101
Who else is he dealing with?

530
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,270
Why don't you ask him yourself?

531
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,772
He be back tonight. Any minute.

532
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,732
He's coming to work
at the Roadhouse?

533
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,776
He the bartender, isn't he?

534
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,238
Bernard,
we've got you tied up in a chair.

535
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,450
You're mixed up with your brother
in a wide variety of felonies.

536
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,953
What I wanna know is,
why in the world would you tell us

537
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,038
where and when to find him?

538
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,491
- Yeah?
- Leo.

539
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,827
- It's Jacques.
- What's up?

540
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,454
The light. The bust light's on.

541
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,456
- Bernard's in trouble.
- You sure?

542
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,916
I saw it, man.

543
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,835
You gotta get me out of here, Leo.
Border run.

544
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,505
- Where are you?
- Phone booth by the cash and carry.

545
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,424
And I don't like waiting, man.

546
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,677
Shut up. I'm on my way.

547
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,596
Hi.

548
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,937
- Where you going?
- You don't need to know.

549
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,227
Josie.

550
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,312
Josie, what's wrong?

551
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,399
Nothing.

552
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,861
- Nothing?
- Mm.

553
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,370
God, you're beautiful.

554
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,633
Josie, there is something wrong.

555
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,176
What is it? I want you to tell me.

556
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,808
Something horrible
is going to happen.

557
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,396
- They wanna hurt me. I know it.
- Who?

558
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,856
Who wants to hurt you?

559
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,525
Catherine.

560
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,402
Catherine and Benjamin Horne.

561
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,782
What makes you think so?

562
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:54,331
I heard Catherine
on the phone saying I'd never suspect.

563
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,458
Just like with Andrew's death.

564
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,752
Andrew's death was an accident.

565
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,670
Was it?

566
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,631
Catherine keeps
the mill account books in her safe.

567
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,968
Two books. Different numbers.

568
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,974
Andrew built this years ago.

569
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:18,313
I don't think Catherine knows
that I know it's here.

570
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,610
Why do you think
they have two sets of books?

571
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,155
The usual reasons would have
something to do with stealing.

572
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,324
Maybe worse.

573
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,832
There were two. I saw them.

574
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,168
You believe me, don't you?

575
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,295
Of course I do.

576
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,674
There's nothing unusual in this one.

577
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,093
Oh, there were two.

578
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,179
I swear, there were two.

579
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:09,447
Have you seen my tackle box?

580
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:14,702
The next time you and the merry
widow wanna take a peek in my safe,

581
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,871
don't go to so much trouble.

582
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,708
Be a man about it, Pete.
Ask me to my face.

583
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:30,718
Maybe I'll, um, check the truck.

584
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,504
Dr. Jacoby.

585
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,425
I didn't see you at the funeral today.

586
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,722
I'm a terrible person, Agent Cooper.

587
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:20,268
I pretend that I'm not, but I am.

588
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:26,107
Oh, I sit and listen to their problems,

589
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,609
day after day.

590
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:33,907
These people think of me
as their friend.

591
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,704
The truth is, I really don't care.

592
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:46,461
I thought nothing, no one,

593
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,172
could ever reach me again.

594
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,136
Laura changed all that.

595
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,976
I couldn't come today.

596
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,231
I just couldn't.

597
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,487
I hope she understands.

598
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,534
I hope she forgives me.

599
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,205
You think it's possible?

600
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:26,084
You think somebody killed Andrew?

601
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,838
I don't know.

602
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:38,513
I believe what they want
is to take the mill away from me.

603
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:42,433
For Benjamin to have the land.

604
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:48,356
If it was true with Andrew,

605
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,693
you think they'll kill me too?

606
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,861
Think they would?

607
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,866
Josie,

608
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,785
nothing is gonna happen to you.

609
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:05,832
Not now, not ever.
Not while I'm around.

610
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,422
Do you believe in the soul?

611
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,592
Several.

612
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:01,596
- More than one?
- Blackfoot legend.

613
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:06,267
Waking souls that give life
to the mind and the body.

614
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,645
A dream soul that wanders.

615
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,105
Dream souls.

616
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:15,485
- Where do they wander?
- Faraway places.

617
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,279
The Land of the Dead.

618
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,366
Is that where Laura is?

619
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,284
Laura's in the ground, Agent Cooper.

620
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,204
That's the only thing I'm sure of.

621
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,427
To Laura.

622
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,474
Godspeed.

623
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,525
- Will you dance with me?
- No.

624
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,403
- Sorry, pal.
- Please.

625
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,779
- Dance with me?
- No.

626
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,198
- Please.
- That's kind of rude, mister.

627
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,992
- Dance with me.
- Come on, leave us alone.

628
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,869
Dance with me, please?

629
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:10,915
Please.

630
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,752
Somebody dance with me.

631
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,886
Mr. Palmer? Leland.

632
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,857
Let's take you home.

633
00:45:36,024 --> 00:46:57,104
Home.
