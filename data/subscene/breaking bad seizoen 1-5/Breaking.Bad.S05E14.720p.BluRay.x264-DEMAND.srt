1
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,279
Yo, so, what's next?

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,755
We wait.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,835
We don't got like eight more
anal things we gotta do first?

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,398
The reaction has begun.

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,798
Yeah, I know. So how long?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,313
Well, if we had a freezer, the condensed
liquid would cool more quickly

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,554
because, of course, this is an
exothermic reaction, which means

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,876
"giving off heat."

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,117
And our desired product is...

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,518
Put me into a coma, why don't you?

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,074
What did you just say?

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,199
What? What? Nothing.

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,519
Huh.

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,396
No, no, no. Not in here.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,876
Duh. Like I'm an idiot.

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,118
Yeah. Like you're an idiot.

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,879
Dick.

18
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,356
Aah.

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,911
God. Jesus. God.

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,156
Shut up.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,392
Oh, wow.

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,430
Bogdan. Bogdan says I'm not
doing the receipts right.

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,916
Well, he's got a bug up his butt.

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,555
He's got a stick up his butt?

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,793
He's got a bug up his butt
about the receipts, anyways.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,471
So anyway, he's insisting that I--

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,952
He's demanding that I stay

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,356
and look over his system

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,990
and I cannot get out of it.

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,560
Yeah.

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,671
Hello.
<i>Hi, honey. It's me.</i>

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,634
Hey, you. What's going on?
<i>Nothing much.</i>

33
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,598
I was just calling
to say I'm sorry

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,071
but I'm gonna be late tonight.

35
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,431
Bogdan. He's got
a bug up his butt.

36
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,714
That's okay. I wasn't planning
anything special for dinner, so...

37
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,199
In fact, you could take pity on us
and bring a pizza home.

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,596
They're having a two-for-one
at Venezia's.

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,315
At this point,
I could eat a whole one by myself.

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,031
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I can pick up a pizza.

41
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,317
Hopefully Bogdan
won't keep me too late.

42
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,753
He better not. Trust me, he does not want
to piss off a hungry pregnant woman.

43
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,080
Ooh, what's that sound?
<i>I just sold your favorite piece.</i>

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,875
The hideous crying clown.
<i>Wow.</i>

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,511
Yeah, and I got 9 bucks
more than I paid for it.

46
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,712
Shows what I know about art.

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,475
<i>Hey, what do you think about Holly?</i>

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,073
<i>For the baby's name.</i>

49
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,839
Do you like it?

50
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,679
I think I really like it.

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,278
Holly. Yeah, it's nice.

52
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,715
Let me think about it.

53
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,152
Just feels right, you know?
It's my new favorite.

54
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,676
Well, it's a front-runner, for sure.

55
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,200
Listen, I was thinking, um, maybe we can
have a little family time this weekend.

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,392
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>
Yeah.

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,592
You know, just take a drive.

58
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,110
The almost four of us.
Ha-ha-ha.

59
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,516
<i>Maybe we can head up
the Turquoise Trail,</i>

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,872
<i>stop at Tinkertown,
maybe grab some lunch in Madrid.</i>

61
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,390
Oh, my God.
We haven't been there in forever.

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,670
<i>I know.</i>
Yeah.

63
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,600
<i>So why don't we just do that?
Take a little break?</i>

64
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,556
<i>Sold. Sounds fun.</i>

65
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,514
Holly. It's growing on me.

66
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,110
Yep. Me too.

67
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,910
All right, well, I had better go
and get this in the mail.

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,794
<i>Why don't you call me
when you're on your way home?</i>

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,277
Will do. Love you.
<i>Love you too.</i>

70
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,074
Whoa, simmer down there, sparky.

71
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,311
What the hell did we just walk into?

72
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,950
Hey, Uncle Jack,
I don't see Jesse Pinkman.

73
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,992
He was right here before.

74
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,476
- Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?
- No.

75
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
What do you figure? He maybe
headed down that gully there?

76
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,154
That's the way I'd go.

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,273
Frankie, Lester, go find him.

78
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,119
Jack.

79
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,595
These guys are DEA.

80
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,159
No! Jack, no!

81
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,033
Jack! Jack! Jack!

82
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,993
No! No, don't!

83
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,351
Jack, don't. No.

84
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,196
No, Jack, Jack, Jack!
Jack, no!

85
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,552
Jack, no. Don't kill him.
Uh-uh-uh. Back it up.

86
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,752
Don't kill him, Jack.
Get back here.

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,235
The hell not? He's DEA.

88
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,915
No, he's family.

89
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,276
Say again?

90
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,032
He's my family.

91
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,233
He's my brother-in-law.

92
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,591
Didn't cross your mind
to maybe tell us

93
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,269
you had a DEA agent
for a brother-in-law?

94
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,679
Did you know about this?
I called you off, remember?

95
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,357
I told you not to come.
Well, it seems to me we did you a solid.

96
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,234
- You weren't supposed to be here.
- Too late now.

97
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,276
How's about you telling me
what was going down out here? Hm?

98
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,030
You and your brother-in-law
don't seem to be getting along too well.

99
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,153
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't concern you.

100
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,558
We just wasted his partner here,
and he's wearing a bullet,

101
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,400
so, yeah, I'd say
it does concern me.

102
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,320
This is between him and me.

103
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,034
No cavalry coming?

104
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,634
No.

105
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,320
You bet your ass the cavalry's coming.

106
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,273
No, no, no! Jack--

107
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,633
Jack! No, the DEA
doesn't know about this.

108
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,159
Not yet.

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,239
Hank.

110
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,193
Nothing can change
what just happened,

111
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,040
but you can walk out of here alive

112
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,917
if you just promise us
that you'll let this go.

113
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,916
Yeah, I thought as much.

114
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,800
Sorry, man. Just no scenario
where this guy lives.

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,957
No, no, no, listen! I have money!

116
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,240
I have money!
It's buried out here. It's...

117
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,840
It's $80 million.

118
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,360
Eighty million.

119
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,276
Hm. So that's what got
this party started, huh?

120
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,033
But this money of yours
won't do me much good in prison.

121
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,916
You can go anywhere.
You can do anything. Think about it.

122
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,431
You can have any future
that you want.

123
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,116
Jack.

124
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,478
Eighty million.

125
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,434
And all you've got to do

126
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,278
is let him go.

127
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,312
That's a hell of an offer.

128
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,558
What do you think, fed?

129
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,594
Would you take that deal?

130
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,553
It's Hank.

131
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,995
His name is Hank.

132
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,152
How about it, Hank?

133
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,757
Should I let you go?

134
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,794
My name is ASAC Schrader.

135
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,791
And you can go fuck yourself.

136
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,791
Hank, listen to me.

137
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,835
You gotta tell him.

138
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,600
You gotta tell him now
that we can work this out.

139
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,996
Please. Please.

140
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,951
What? You want me to beg?

141
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,399
You're the smartest guy I ever met.

142
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,430
And you're too stupid to see...

143
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,877
he made up his mind
10 minutes ago.

144
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,909
Do what you're gonna do.

145
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,956
Pretty specific directions.

146
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,551
Most people tell me to be somewhere,
they say, "West on the 40,

147
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,674
this or that exit, second gas station
on the left." You know?

148
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,351
This here? This is a whole other story.

149
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,076
That fancy phone of yours,
where does it say this is exactly?

150
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,278
Yeah.

151
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,990
Look at this.
They even brought a shovel.

152
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,514
Jack, no sign of Pinkman.

153
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,993
All right.

154
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,556
Says this is it right here.

155
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,274
Dig.

156
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,871
What's that? A barrel?
Couple barrels?

157
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,559
- Oh, Jesus.
- Hell, yeah!

158
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,672
Oh, Jesus. Would you
look at that? Ha-ha-ha.

159
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,111
- Hell, yeah!
- Goddamn.

160
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,512
Whoo!

161
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,193
What are you waiting for?

162
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,635
Yeah, boss. Hell, yeah.

163
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,674
Let me get on this side.
Get that out of there, man.

164
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,274
Okay. Pull a barrel off the truck
and load it in the Chrysler.

165
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,598
Seriously?
Jack.

166
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,595
That's like 10 or 11 million right there.
You sure you wanna do that?

167
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,196
You gonna make me
say it again? Go, go.

168
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,754
Chop, chop.

169
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,679
Jesus, what's with
all the greed here?

170
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,673
It's unattractive.

171
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,354
Hey.

172
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,674
Hey.

173
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,557
I'm leaving you a barrel.

174
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,997
Boys are gonna load it for you.

175
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,156
You got the keys to these cuffs?

176
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,072
I'm sorry for your loss.

177
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,115
My nephew here, he respects you.

178
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,438
He would never forgive me
if things went another way.

179
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,438
Also you caught me in a good mood.

180
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,077
So here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna get in your car,

181
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,677
and you're gonna drive out of here,
all right?

182
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,911
No hard feelings.

183
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,993
Understand me?

184
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,399
We square?

185
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,713
Hey, man, I gotta know we're square, or
we're gonna have to go that other way.

186
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,839
Pinkman.

187
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,718
Pinkman.

188
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,756
You still owe me.

189
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,596
If you can find him,
we'll kill him.

190
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,840
Found him.

191
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,599
No!

192
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,837
Get off me!

193
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,076
Get off!

194
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,718
No, no.

195
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,876
Good to go?

196
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,796
Hey, Uncle Jack.

197
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,555
Well, he was out here
with those feds.

198
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,074
Right? Working with them. Should we
maybe find out what he told them first?

199
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,114
Because, I mean, he had
to have told them some stuff

200
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,710
that might not be too good for us.

201
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,956
And I'll bet we could

202
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,680
get it out of him back home.

203
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,196
I mean, I can do it.

204
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,394
Me and him, we got history.

205
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,912
And then, you know, we'd
take care of the job after that.

206
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,077
Works for me. Work for you?

207
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,192
Let's go, pal.
No.

208
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,880
No!

209
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,594
No!

210
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,990
No!

211
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,714
Wait.

212
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,760
I watched Jane die.

213
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,312
I was there.

214
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,353
And I watched her die.

215
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,392
I watched her overdose
and choke to death.

216
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,437
I could have saved her.

217
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,232
But I didn't.

218
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,794
Hi.
Hello.

219
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,632
That truck belong to you?

220
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,240
It does.

221
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,595
I'd like to buy it.

222
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,197
It's not for sale.

223
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,516
Hey, Walt, it's me. Um,

224
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,393
just thought I'd try you again.

225
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,513
We were just wondering
when you thought you'd be back,

226
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,760
so just give us a call
whenever you can.

227
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,994
Bye.

228
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,233
Hey, Aunt Marie.

229
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,272
Hey, sweetie.

230
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,034
Haven't seen you for a while.
What have you been up to?

231
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,436
Oh, you know. This and that.

232
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,230
Your mom and I need to talk,
so thought I'd stop by.

233
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,473
Well, I, uh,
wish you'd called first.

234
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,070
This isn't the best time.

235
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,835
Well, Flynn looks like
he can hold down the fort.

236
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,077
Why don't we go into your office?

237
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,792
I got it.

238
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,950
Okay, honey. Thanks.

239
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,398
Marie, I have nothing to say.
Well, I do.

240
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,519
So you can just sit there
and listen.

241
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,157
I got a call from Hank.
He arrested Walt

242
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,720
three hours ago.

243
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,479
It's over.

244
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,479
"Dead to rights"
I believe is the expression.

245
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,310
Hank and Steve Gomez are working
with a former associate of Walt's,

246
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,672
Jesse Pinkman,
whom I know you know,

247
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,351
and Pinkman has supplied them
with everything they need.

248
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,430
Hank is booking Walt
as we speak.

249
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,235
And I, for one, could not be happier.

250
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,117
I almost didn't come here.

251
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,794
Christ, I barely even know
who you are,

252
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,471
and I sure as hell don't know
if I can ever trust you again.

253
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,391
And then I think about
how you were so upset with Walt

254
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,399
and how you wanted
the kids out of the house,

255
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,311
and all of this makes me believe
that there has got to be hope for you,

256
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,309
that whatever he did to you
can be undone.

257
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,873
All I know, all I have been
forcing myself to remember,

258
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,639
is that you are my sister.

259
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,238
And so I'm here.

260
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,793
Marie--
Everything changes now.

261
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,038
And you have got
to prepare yourself.

262
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,398
Hank will help you as much
as he can. I know he will.

263
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,436
And I will support you through this.

264
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,757
But I have conditions.

265
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,270
Give me every single copy
of that obscenity

266
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,880
that the two of you made
to discredit Hank.

267
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,956
That DVD. Every single copy.

268
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,393
You understand me?

269
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,993
Answer me.
Do you understand me?

270
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,634
Yes.

271
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,753
Good.

272
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,557
Now dry your eyes
and get Flynn in here.

273
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,838
You are going to tell him everything,
and I mean everything.

274
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,390
He deserves to know
the truth from his family.

275
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,557
Not a bunch of uniformed strangers.

276
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,514
No. No. No, he cannot know.
You tell him,

277
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,079
or I will.

278
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,677
There's no way around this.

279
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,715
He needs to know,
and he needs to know now.

280
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,080
No.

281
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,720
Look, I gave you what you wanted.

282
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,158
Come on, please.

283
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,714
Hey, please.

284
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,355
I told you where to find the tape, okay?
Yup.

285
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,876
Hey, just go.

286
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,595
Just go there.
Just go to his house and get it.

287
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,599
We're on it.
Get it!

288
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,270
No one else knows about it.
Just me and his partner.

289
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,439
Okay.
No one else knows, I swear!

290
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,353
Let's cook.

291
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,557
You're completely out of your mind.

292
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,637
It's the truth.
It is, Flynn.

293
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,111
Then both of you
are out of your minds.

294
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,994
You're full of shit,
is what you are. Both of you.

295
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,160
If this is true, then how could you
keep this a secret?

296
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,718
I mean, why?
Why would you go along?

297
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,233
I'll be asking myself that
for the rest of my life.

298
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,156
So you're saying all this time
you were lying about this?

299
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,711
I mean, so you're saying you're a liar.

300
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,877
You just admitted it.

301
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,676
So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

302
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,280
Which lie is it?

303
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,596
Flynn, honey,

304
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,154
your mother
is telling you the truth.

305
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,114
Right here, right now. Believe it.

306
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,280
You know what? This is bullshit.
This is bullshit.

307
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,994
Baby--
I wanna talk to Dad.

308
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,238
Your dad's in custody.
You can't talk to him for a while.

309
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,433
I'm calling Uncle Hank.
I've tried. He's not answering.

310
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,592
He's probably in the thick of it

311
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,958
with your father. Honey, I know
this is a lot to process, Flynn,

312
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,073
but if you could just breathe,
just try to breathe

313
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,352
and just trust--
Really? Really? Try to breathe?

314
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,114
Oh, my God.

315
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,840
Go home.

316
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,714
Just take the kids home, okay?
Go home and regroup.

317
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,877
I'll stop by later.

318
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,280
Flynn?

319
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,840
Could you put
your seatbelt on, please?

320
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,715
Please. It's not safe.

321
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,591
You're shitting me, right?

322
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,760
If all this is true
and you knew about it,

323
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,237
then you're as bad as him.

324
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,877
Whose truck is that?

325
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,313
Dad?

326
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,352
Listen, I need you to come inside
and pack right now.

327
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,517
Mom, Aunt Marie,

328
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,313
they said that you were arrested?
No, just--

329
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,153
You're some kind of drug dealer?

330
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,352
No, just come inside,
please. Now.

331
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,710
Come inside. Come on.

332
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,752
Go, go, go.

333
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,709
Dad, stop. Just talk to me, please.
Our priority right now is to pack.

334
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,033
Uncle Hank, they said he arrested you?
I will discuss all of this later, okay?

335
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,356
Just tell me what--

336
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,710
Just listen to me!

337
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,594
Go into your bedroom now,
grab anything important.

338
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,952
You understand? Go. Now.
Both of you. Go.

339
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,276
Walt.

340
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,710
Why are you here?

341
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,795
Skyler, please,
will you just go get your things?

342
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,037
For you and the kids. Now.
This is our priority.

343
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,076
Hank had you in custody.
He wouldn't just let you go.

344
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,115
Where is he?
I--

345
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,199
Where's Hank?
I...

346
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,516
I negotiated--

347
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,399
Negotiated?
Yes.

348
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,478
What does that mean?

349
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,712
It means we're fine, okay?

350
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,594
We are. We're fine.
Everything is gonna be fine,

351
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,598
but we need to leave right now.

352
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,836
All right? Can we do that?

353
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,070
What happened?

354
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,354
Where is Hank?

355
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,960
Why do we need to leave?

356
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,676
I need both of you to trust me.

357
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,837
Right now, okay?

358
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,111
Please, just work with me here,

359
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,996
and I promise I will explain
everything later, okay?

360
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,797
Where is Hank?

361
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,039
Skyler.

362
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,720
I have $11 million in cash
right outside.

363
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,516
We can have a fresh start.

364
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,756
Whole new lives.

365
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,952
All we have to do is go.

366
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,470
We have to go right now.

367
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,070
That's all we have to do.

368
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,279
You killed him.

369
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,278
You killed Hank.

370
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,039
What?
No, no, no.

371
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,800
You killed him. Aah!
No, no, no!

372
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,719
I tried to save him.

373
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,151
Uncle Hank is dead? I--

374
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,831
Mom, it can't be true. It just can't be true.
Just stop, please.

375
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,997
Everything is gonna be okay.

376
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,910
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise,
but we need to leave right now.

377
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,589
Dad, what's going on? Talk to me.

378
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,156
Just stop for one second.

379
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,518
- Look, I told you to get your things.
- Stop walking away.

380
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,030
- There is no time.
- Tell me about Uncle Hank.

381
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,636
- No, just drop it!
- But what's wrong with you?

382
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,832
We're going.
We're going right now.

383
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,032
You have to tell me. Dad, wait.

384
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,677
What happened to Uncle Hank?
What--?

385
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,155
Get out.

386
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,749
Skyler, I promise you,
we will figure this out.

387
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,917
Enough.
Mom,

388
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,679
what are you doing?

389
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,076
Skyler, put the knife down, please.

390
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,958
I promise you, everything--
Don't say one more word.

391
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,798
Get out of here now.

392
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,711
Skyler--
Get out!

393
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,313
Stop it! Just stop! Just stop!

394
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,275
Let go! Let go!
Get away from us!

395
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,312
Just stop! Stop!

396
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,434
Dad, stop it! Stop!

397
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,279
Mom, stop it.

398
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,076
Stop, Dad. Stop it now. Stop.

399
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,034
Stop! Just, please, stop!

400
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,991
Stop it! Stop! Stop it!

401
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,149
What the hell is wrong with you?!
We're a family!

402
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,439
We're a family.

403
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,272
What are you doing?

404
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,960
What are you doing?

405
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,389
Yeah, I need the police.

406
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,115
My dad, he pulled a knife
on my mom.

407
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,880
He attacked her. He's dangerous.

408
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,152
I think he might have
killed somebody.

409
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,033
Yeah.

410
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,552
He's still here.

411
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,594
Yeah, he's still in the house.

412
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,760
We're at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

413
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,431
308 Negra Arroyo Lane!
You've gotta come quick.

414
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,032
Hurry, hurry. Oh, God, no, no!

415
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,798
Oh, my God. No.

416
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,231
Walt, no! Walt!
Mom!

417
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,113
Walt, please, no!

418
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,552
No! No! No!

419
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,638
Walt, no! Let her go!

420
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,473
You can't take her!

421
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,514
Let her go, please!
You can't take her!

422
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,831
Let her go! Walt!

423
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,317
Walt, please, no!

424
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,876
Walt, no! Walt, please!

425
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,839
Walt, no!

426
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,839
Walt, please, no!

427
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,919
Walt, please!

428
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,113
Please, stop! Walt!

429
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,513
Say, "Da-da."

430
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,030
Da-da. You say, "Da-da"?

431
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,075
There. Get rid of that
stinky old diaper, huh?

432
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,954
Don't be sad.
Where's your belly button?

433
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,595
Where's your belly button?

434
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,076
There. Now, don't you feel better?

435
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,273
You're all nice and dry. Huh?

436
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,312
That feels good? Oh, I know.

437
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,997
You were so wet and so cranky,
but now you feel better, don't you?

438
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,877
Next order of business
is to get you a brand-new car seat.

439
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,390
Won't that be nice, Holly?

440
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,192
Mama.

441
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,357
Mama.

442
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,952
Mama.

443
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,237
Mama.

444
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,118
Mama.

445
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,319
Mama.

446
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,354
Mama.

447
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,279
Confirming the abduction.

448
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,075
Amber Alert. Holly White.

449
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,351
Female, 18 months.

450
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,472
Blond hair, blue eyes.

451
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,709
Was last seen wearing
a pink and white jacket, pink pants.

452
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,519
Abductor is the father...

453
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,040
He was in handcuffs.
Hank had him in handcuffs.

454
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,639
Bald head, goatee,
gold, wire-framed glasses.

455
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,478
Are you expecting a call?

456
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,111
<i>Hi, you've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.</i>

457
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,556
<i>Skyler, it's me. Pick up. Pick up.</i>

458
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,151
That's him. That's my husband.
<i>I need you to pick up the phone.</i>

459
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,760
Start a trace on the landline.

460
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,433
The number's 505-177-8987.
<i>I know you're there, so pick it up.</i>

461
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,472
<i>Skyler, you hear me?</i>

462
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,960
Need the location of an incoming caller.

463
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,998
<i>Answer the pho--</i>

464
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,196
Walt, where's Holly?

465
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,993
<i>Are you alone?</i>

466
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,953
<i>No police?</i>

467
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,359
No. No police.

468
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,991
Where are you? Where's Holly?

469
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,353
Walt!
<i>What the hell is wrong with you?</i>

470
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,520
<i>Why can't you do one thing I say?</i>

471
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,236
What?
<i>This is your fault.</i>

472
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,194
<i>This is what comes of your disrespect.</i>

473
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,119
I told you, Skyler.

474
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,879
I warned you for a solid year.

475
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,635
You cross me,
there will be consequences.

476
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,917
What part of that
didn't you understand?

477
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,840
You took my child.

478
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,394
<i>Because you need to learn.</i>

479
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,478
You bring her back.

480
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,919
Maybe now you'll listen.
Maybe now you'll use your damn head.

481
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,430
You know, you never believed in me.

482
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,752
You were never grateful
for anything I did for this family.

483
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,670
<i>"Oh, no. Walt. Walt, you have to stop.</i>

484
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,715
<i>You have to stop this.
It's immoral. It's illegal.</i>

485
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,116
<i>Someone might get hurt."</i>

486
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,036
<i>You're always whining and complaining
about how I make my money,</i>

487
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,194
<i>just dragging me down,
while I do everything.</i>

488
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,830
<i>And now--</i>

489
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,199
Now you tell my son what I do,

490
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:19,113
<i>after I've told you and told you
to keep your damn mouth shut.</i>

491
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,234
You stupid bitch.

492
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,112
<i>How dare you?</i>

493
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,877
I'm sorry.

494
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,830
You have no right

495
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,357
to discuss anything about what I do.

496
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,836
What the hell do you know
about it anyway?

497
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,271
<i>Nothing. I built this.</i>

498
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,551
<i>Me. Me alone. Nobody else!</i>

499
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,359
You're right.

500
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,999
You're right.

501
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,675
You mark my words, Skyler.

502
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,677
Toe the line

503
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,632
or you will wind up just like Hank.

504
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,760
Walt.

505
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,916
Tell me what happened.

506
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,997
Where is Hank?

507
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,273
Please.

508
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,672
We need to know.

509
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,835
You're never gonna see Hank again.

510
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,197
<i>He crossed me.</i>

511
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,600
<i>You think about that.</i>

512
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,832
<i>Family or no.</i>

513
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,635
You let that sink in.

514
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,633
<i>Walt.</i>

515
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,878
<i>I just want Holly back.</i>

516
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,475
<i>Please, Walt.</i>

517
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,437
<i>Just come home.</i>

518
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,759
I've still got things left to do.

519
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,155
Hey.
