Gone fishing.
The lonesome foghorn blows.
Oh, dear.
Lucy?
Lucy, this is Pete Martell. Lucy, put Harry on the horn.
Sheriff, it's Pete Martell up at the mill.
Um, I'm gonna transfer it to the phone on the table by the red chair.
The red chair against the wall.
The little table with the lamp on it.
The lamp that we moved from the corner.
The black phone, not the brown phone.
Morning, Pete. Harry.
She's dead.
Wrapped in plastic.
Whoa, hold on. Hold on a second, Pete.
Where?
You stay right there. I'm on my way.
You better get Dr. Hayward.
Tell him to meet me up at the Packard Mill,
the dock right below the dam.
And roust that Andy out of bed, tell him to get his butt up there now.
What is it? We got a body up there.
Lucy, not a word about this to anyone until you hear from me.
It's over here.
You want forensics first?
No, she's been in the water.
We'd better take some pictures.
Who is she? Andy, pictures.
Sorry. Then we'll turn her over.
Sure, okay.
Oh, Andy.
My God, Andy.
Same thing as last year in Mr. Blodgett's barn.
Give me the camera, Andy. Sorry.
Is this gonna happen every damn time?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. Okay. Okay.
Why don't you go up to the coroner's van
and bring back that stretcher?
Okay. Okay.
Sorry.
Harry, let's roll her over.
Good Lord. Laura.
Laura Palmer.
Laura.
Laura, sweetheart, I'm not gonna tell you again.
Yes, I am.
Laura.
Laura?
Oh, for goodness sakes.
Laura, now means now.
Laura?
Laura?
Laura, honey, are you downstairs?
Hello? Bett, it's Sarah.
Listen, I just went up to wake Laura and she's not here.
Is she with Bobby? Well, she could be.
He leaves every morning to go running and then he goes to football practice.
Can you, um, find out? Can you reach him? I'll call the school.
Just a minute, I've got the number of the field office here.
Thanks. Thanks, Bett.
You know, I'm wondering if maybe she went out with Leland.
He had an early meeting.
Oh, I'm sure that's it. Either that or she's with Bobby.
Sure. I'll call up to the hotel, thanks.
Hmm.
No, Bobby hasn't showed up for practice yet today.
And come to think of it, as a matter of fact,
he's been late every day this week, Mrs. Palmer.
And last week.
And maybe even the week before.
Are they ready to sign? You're not gonna mention
that we have not as yet acquired access to the Packard land?
Sorry.
We have solid information
that the Packard Sawmill is gonna go belly-up within a year.
We're gonna be able to get it for a song. One verse, no chorus.
Now,
let's get out there
and get those cheese-eaters where they live.
Ahh, Benjamin...
Clean, wholesome environment, much like your very own.
With a quality of life
to rival the very best that this country has to offer.
And that is what the Ghostwood Country Club and Estates will be.
Now, when I first spoke to Sven,
he was naturally very concerned about the quality of air here.
If you'll permit me, Sven,
to repeat what you told me this morning after your run:
"My air sacs, ah, have never felt so good."
Your wife's on the phone again. She said it's urgent.
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I'll be right back.
Uh, make it snappy, huh?
So...
...here in Twin Peaks,
health and industry go hand in hand.
I'll transfer you to the house phone. Okay, thank you.
Ahh. Sarah, what is it?
Is Laura with you? No, why?
She didn't go with you this morning?
No, what...? Honey, what's wrong? What's this all about?
She's not here. She wasn't here this morning.
Well, she's, um, probably with Bobby.
I can't find Bobby.
Well, there you are. That's it.
Let's not worry. I mean, they're probably together.
She would've left a note. Why didn't she?
She would've told me. Honey, honey, take it easy, please.
Excuse me. I'm looking for Leland Palmer.
He's right over there on the phone.
Sheriff Truman.
What? Who? What did you say?
Oh, my God.
Oh, God. Laura.
No.
Laura. Oh, Leland, please, what is it? Tell me.
Leland...
Is this about Laura?
I'm afraid it is.
Leland?
Tell me.
Oh. My baby.
No! Oh, no!
No. Okay?
Leland, we're ready to go with the contracts.
Leland?
What's wrong?
My daughter's dead.
No!
What kept you, Heidi? Seconds on knockwurst this morning?
I couldn't get my car started.
Too busy jump-starting the old man, huh?
I thought you Germans were always on time.
I thought the only time you cared about, Bobby, was making time.
You heading out, Shelly?
Yeah, I'm heading home.
I'm going to practice. I can drop you by your place on the way if you want.
That would be great, thanks.
Here's a tune for you, gals.
Okay.
Norma.
I'll see you in my dreams.
Not if I see you first.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
I think she knows about us.
Norma? Mm-hm.
No. Fat chance. I think she's hot to trot for you herself.
It's happy hour in France.
Come on, cowboy, light your fire.
Right. Just a little pick-me-up before home room?
I thought I was your little pick-me-up. Ha, ha.
Baby, you are more like a three-stage rocket.
A pocket rocket.
And what stage are we in now?
Are you sure that your old man is still on the road?
Yes, he called me last night from Butte.
That's a long ways away and he ain't got a phone in his truck.
So quit worrying and start scurrying, Mr. Touchdown.
Butte.
Back up.
I'll call you later.
Leland, I'm so sorry.
Seventeen years old.
Lee, I hate to put you through this.
No, I have to see her.
I have to see what was done to my little girl.
Okay.
My baby.
It's my little girl.
God, God. Let's get out of here.
I can't...
Oh, God.
Have you seen Laura? No, not yet.
Nice day for a picnic. Uh, yeah.
Bobby Briggs, they're looking for you.
Who is? Sheriff is.
Well, here I am in school.
Hey, Snake. Hey, man, something's up.
Where? Think I'm kidding?
What, me worry?
Bobby, you're wanted in the office.
Who wants me in the office? Right now, young man.
Watch out.
Terry Franklin? Here.
Martha Grimes? Here.
Donna Hayward? Here.
Audrey Horne? Here.
James Hurley? Yo.
Excuse me. Room 106?
Mm-hm.
Is there a Bobby Briggs in this classroom?
No, um, he's in 107? 107.
Could I speak to you for a moment, please?
Certainly.
Um, there's a... Mm-hm.
The principal will be making an announcement.
Yes?
Thank you for your time.
Laura.
There will be an announcement from the principal.
I told you, I got up early like I always do.
I went running like I always do.
I went for some breakfast at the Double R
and I didn't go to practice because I didn't feel like it.
Why didn't you feel like it, Bobby? Were you upset about something?
Something troubling you, Bobby? You wanna tell us about it?
Look, you guys, please, what did I do? What's going on?
Mr. Wolchezk, there's rumors all over school.
Maybe it's best if they heard it from you.
Mr. Wolchezk, why don't you go ahead and make that announcement?
Now? Now's the time.
Excuse me.
What is it, sheriff? What's going on?
Now, Bobby, you look at me.
Your girlfriend, Laura Palmer's, been killed.
She was found just after dawn.
Now, she was with you last night
and you weren't where you were supposed to be this morning.
Have these fellas advised you of your rights?
Yes, but I didn't know why.
Laura's dead? Yes.
Did you understand your rights as they were explained to you?
You think I killed her?
We're gonna have you make a phone call.
You can call your parents and they can arrange to get a lawyer to be with you
when we talk to you again.
Andy, take Bobby out to make his call.
I loved her.
And she loved me.
You think because I wasn't at football practice that I killed my girlfriend?
You are crazy.
You get off of me.
Bobby, we're gonna talk about this later.
May I have your attention, please? This is Principal Wolchezk.
I am deeply saddened to have to tell you
that early this morning your classmate Laura Palmer was found dead.
This is a terrible moment for all of us.
For all of us who knew her.
Her friends, her family.
It is very important that we all try to help each other
through this difficult time.
The police have asked me to ask each of you,
if you have any information about Laura's activities
after school yesterday
or yesterday evening,
please come forward.
I am dismissing all classes for the day,
but before we leave,
I would like to ask each of you
to join me in a moment of silence
for Laura
and her dear memory.
Oh, God.
You can talk to her now, Harry.
Do you know what time it was
when you last saw Laura, Mrs. Palmer?
What time? Yes.
Uh, it would have been about 9.
Yes, 9:00...
...p.m.
She came home from Bobby's
and she was going up the stairs.
Those stairs right there.
Who's upstairs?
Your husband and one of my men.
I can tell from the sounds that it isn't her.
Her diary?
Do you know where the key to this is, sir?
Do you have to take that? We'll return it as soon as possible.
Did she say anything to you?
No.
She said good night.
And I said good...
Good night, sweetheart.
Mrs. Palmer, can you remember,
did she make or receive any phone calls?
I heard her phone ring once.
About what time was that?
I don't know who it was.
Harry.
That was Lucy.
Got a call from a guy that works up at the mill, Janek Pulaski.
Says his daughter didn't come home last night.
And she didn't show up at school today either.
Two by fours, four by eights.
Two by fours, four by...
Did you hear me? You can't do that to my workers.
Don't walk away from me like that. Come on back here.
You're not going anywhere
and you're not gonna tell anybody anything.
Katherine,
I'm sorry if this offends you, but I am the owner of this sawmill.
And you don't know the first thing about this mill.
That's why I'm running it.
I've never taken this authority before, but maybe I should have.
You're not shutting us down.
Katherine, I have the final say-so.
Peter, push the plug.
Pete, don't you dare.
Katherine, please.
Shorty, tell the boys to pull the plug.
That's right.
May I have your attention? This is Josie Packard.
I've decided that today, in the light of what has happened,
all work here will stop.
Bitch.
This morning, as you know, the body of Miss Laura Palmer...
What's your name?
Was found near our dock. Fred Truax.
You're fired.
Just now your coworker and a friend, Mr. Janek Pulaski,
has learned that his daughter,
one of Laura's schoolmates, is missing since last night.
Today, all work here will stop.
The mill will shut down.
Perhaps you can spend the day with your families.
Thank you all for your attention.
What the hell?
Laura's dead.
Yeah, I heard.
She was the one.
Buy you a coffee?
Can't do it.
If you see Donna, could you give this to her?
You bet.
Ed.
Ed.
They said those drapes would be ready by 10.
Now, I want those drapes up by nightfall.
Diane, 11:30 a.m., February 24th. Entering the town of Twin Peaks.
It's five miles south of the Canadian border,
twelve miles west of the state line.
I've never seen so many trees in my life.
As W.C. Fields would say, "I'd rather be here than Philadelphia."
Fifty-four degrees on a slightly overcast day.
Weatherman said rain.
If you could get paid that kind of money for being wrong 60 percent of the time,
it'd beat working.
Mileage is 79,345, gauge is on reserve.
I'm riding on fumes here, I gotta tank up when I get into town.
Remind me to tell you how much that is.
Lunch was, uh, $6.31 at the Lamplighter Inn.
That's on Highway 2 near Lewis Fork.
That was a tuna fish sandwich on whole wheat,
slice of cherry pie and a cup of coffee.
Damn good food.
Diane, if you ever get up this way, that cherry pie is worth a stop.
Okay.
Looks like I'll be meeting up with a, uh...
...Sheriff Harry S. Truman.
Shouldn't be too hard to remember that.
He'll be at the Calhoun Memorial Hospital.
Guess we're gonna go and take a look at that girl
that crawled down the railroad tracks off the mountain.
When finished, I'll check into a motel.
The sheriff will be able to recommend a clean place and reasonably priced.
That's what I need. A clean place, reasonably priced.
Oh. Diane, I almost forgot.
I've got to find out what kind of trees these are.
They're really something.
Agent Cooper? Yes.
Sheriff Harry S. Truman. Dale Cooper, FBI.
Pleasure. Ahem. Good to meet you.
Have any trouble finding the place? No, no. Your directions were fine.
Came out over Highway 2, near Lewis Fork.
Stopped at a place called the Lamplighter Inn.
Had a slice of cherry pie. Incredible.
Well, I'll tell you, we're sure glad to have the FBI here.
Kind of lucky, in a way, that Ronette stepped out across the state line.
Whole town's really badly shaken up.
Sure, nice, quiet place, something like this.
Sheriff, let me stop you in the hallway here for just a second.
There's a few things we gotta get straight right off the bat.
I've learned about this the hard way. It's best to talk about it up front.
When the Bureau gets called in, the Bureau's in charge.
Now, you're gonna be working for me.
Sometimes local law has a problem with that.
I hope you understand.
Well, like I said, we're glad to have you here.
Sheriff,
what kind of fantastic trees have you got growing around here?
Big, majestic... Douglas firs.
Douglas firs.
Can someone get me a copy of the coroner's report on the dead girl?
Well, the autopsy hasn't been done yet.
But I'll take you downstairs to the morgue
when we're finished here.
Oh, that will be fine.
Dr. Shelvy, this is FBI Agent Cooper.
Glad to know you. Doctor, how's the girl?
She's in shock, suffering from exposure.
Can I see her? All right, this way.
Was she raped?
Several times.
One perpetrator? We're waiting for the results.
Is there any connection to the dead girl?
Same high school.
Far as we know, they hardly knew each other.
No connection. Mm.
I'd like to question her.
This girl doesn't even know where she is. Or if she is.
What exactly are you saying?
We need a CAT scan and we're not equipped for that here.
My opinion, she may have neurological damage.
She's just not responsive at all.
I'd like to examine her fingers.
All right.
They've already scraped for particles. No, that's not what I'm looking for.
Oh, no, there's nothing here. Not a thing.
Don't go there.
Ronnie?
Ronette?
I catch this fish, pull him out of the water, big mouth.
It's got a big mouth and starts talking to me. Wh...?
Hey, hey.
Harry?
Dr. Jacoby.
Terrible, terrible tragedy.
Yes.
This is Special Agent Dale Cooper.
Gary Cooper? Agent Cooper.
Agent. FBI.
Right. Heh.
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby, Agent Cooper.
Laura was a patient of mine.
You're on your way to the morgue now, do you mind if I join you?
Yes, I do. Why would you want to?
It's sort of against procedure, doctor.
Heh. Well, no offense. I thought I could be of some help.
You still could be. At another time.
Oh. I understand completely.
By the way,
Laura's...
Laura's parents...
Well, they didn't know that she was seeing me. Ha, ha.
That guy's a psychiatrist? Yeah.
I have to apologize again for the fluorescent lights.
I think it's a bad transformer.
That's quite all right.
Agent Cooper, we did scrape those nails when we brought her in.
Here it is.
There it is. Oh, my God, here it is. What?
Would you leave us, please? Jim.
Uh, would you leave us alone, please?
Oh! Certainly.
I've got to find something to grab onto this with.
Diane, I'm at the Twin Peaks County Morgue with the body of the victim...
What's her name? Laura Palmer.
Laura Palmer.
I got here before the autopsy. Diane, it's the same thing.
I had a feeling we'd see this again.
What do you got there?
Ring finger, under the nail.
Let's see what he left us.
It's an "R."
Diane, give this to Albert and his team. Don't go to Sam.
Albert seems a little more on the ball.
We need to bag and tag this. Okay, Cooper.
You gonna let me in on whatever the hell is going on here?
Sheriff, we got a lot to talk about.
Hi, Ed.
Hey, Donna.
I'm so sorry.
Have you seen James yet? He came by.
Is he okay? No.
Do you know where he went? I've already been to the Roadhouse.
I don't know, honey. He told me to give you this.
What the hell are you doing?
Well, I came by... I've been looking all over for you.
In case you didn't realize it, Bobby's in a lot of trouble.
He's my best friend. You're supposed to be with me.
We're going to the police station.
Look, don't tell me where I ought to be.
Second of all, Laura was my best friend.
Get in the car. Muffle it, junior.
Mind your own business. You're on my lot, friend.
Oh, Ed, I'm not your friend.
Donna, you get to the sheriff's right now.
Boy, I sure know how to pick them, huh?
Ed, you waiting for those drapes to hang themselves?
Yeah, okay.
Well, I know how to pick them too.
Will you do me a favor?
If James comes around, tell him I'm looking for him?
You bet.
And, Donna, you take it easy.
Okay.
That's the, uh, videotape we just saw. The one we found in Laura's bedroom.
Right.
At a certain point, I'm gonna wanna show this to the boyfriend.
You say when.
Did you complete your forensics? You bet. All done.
No key yet, huh? We're still looking.
Why not?
Diane, I've just opened Laura Palmer's diary.
This is the, uh...
It's the last entry, dated February 23rd.
It reads, "Asparagus for dinner again. I hate asparagus.
Does this mean I'll never grow up?"
And then she's written, "Nervous about meeting J tonight."
That's the letter J, Diane.
J...
And that is the last entry.
That's something to get started on.
Yeah, that's one out of 26.
Yeah, one out of 26.
Diane, I've just turned back 18 days to day one.
What we have taped to the page here is a plastic envelope
containing a white residue and what looks to be a key
to a safety deposit box.
Sheriff, after you very carefully remove this key,
we're gonna run this envelope.
And my bet is it'll test positive for cocaine.
That's impossible.
You ever been surprised before?
Mr. Cooper, you didn't know Laura Palmer.
Let's get started on a court order to open that safety deposit box,
and maybe we'll both find out a few things about Laura Palmer.
Diane, I'm holding in my hand a small box of chocolate bunnies.
Lucy.
Andy, is that you?
Tell Harry we found where... it happened.
Where Ronette and Laura were taken and tortured.
Tell Harry...
...I didn't cry.
Andy, are you okay?
Sweetie?
But, Lucy,
it's horrible.
Andy.
Sweetie.
Oh, God.
This is to reaffirm that you have been advised
of your constitutional rights, am I correct?
Yes.
Bobby, did you kill Laura Palmer?
No.
She was studying at your house until about 9:30 last night,
isn't that right?
Yeah.
Bobby.
Yes, sir.
Did she drive herself home?
Yes.
You two had a big fight last week, didn't you?
So what?
If I had a fight with her, if I sang songs with her,
if I went skipping rope with her, what difference does it make?
I didn't kill her.
Bobby, here's how this works.
We ask the questions, and you answer the questions that we ask.
Briefly and to the point.
Did you shoot this video, Bobby?
No.
Well, if you didn't, then who did?
Did you know Laura was seeing someone else?
That's what you two fought about last week.
Look at these pictures.
Look how happy she is.
You ever do cocaine with Laura, Bobby?
I don't do drugs.
Excuse me, but what are you charging my client with?
That's right.
You're a football player, aren't you, Bobby?
Bobby, if you knew who she was seeing,
trust us on this, now's the time to tell us.
Why don't you ask Donna?
She was there with her. Because I'm asking you.
Come on, Bobby. Give me a name.
Here's a hint. First initial, J.
J.
No.
She wouldn't do that to me.
You didn't love her, anyway.
Let him go.
Julie, the Norwegians are signing the contract at 4:00
when Mr. Horne returns.
Make sure they do not hear about Laura Palmer's death.
That will blow the whole deal, got it?
Okay, Bob. Thank you, okay.
Okay, Bob. Okay, Bob. Okay.
Julie, what would happen if I pulled this out?
You wouldn't.
Oh... Oh. Oh! Ha, ha.
Audrey, look what you've done.
Audrey... Oh...
Did they scarf that whole damn smorgasbord?
Audrey, honey, don't you go in there. I'm hungry.
Audrey, don't...
Don't go in there. Audrey.
Excuse me, is there something wrong, young, pretty girl?
They found my friend Laura
lying face down on a rocky beach.
Completely naked.
She'd been murdered.
Hey, buddy.
Snake.
We're out of here, man.
Just a sec. Donna's still in there.
You straightened her out yet? I don't know what's up with her, man.
Forget her. I got it figured, Laura and her.
That cop mentioned something about the letter J.
We're looking at some freaking biker.
And some freaking biker's gonna get his head busted open.
What's his name? And we'll finish this quick.
Come outside.
Robert, I'll be at home this evening, if you need a sympathetic ear.
I don't need any damn sympathetic anything.
You know, dear, I have no idea what's going on here.
I... Let's just go home.
So you were on a picnic, just the two of you, way up in the mountains.
Not another soul around?
Is there some law against having a picnic?
Donna, this is interesting to me.
Because with just the two of you out there, I can't for the life of me
figure out how these pictures got taken.
Uh...
Well, that's easy. There was
this, um, hiker that came along.
This woman hiker had a backpack and...
Um...
We asked her to take the pictures for us.
What was her name?
I don't know. I don't think we asked her.
I forgot. I don't know.
Donna, who are you protecting?
Nobody. That's really what happened.
Does this person's name start with the letter J?
No, she didn't tell us her name.
Donna, this is serious business.
More serious than Laura falling in love
with someone other than her boyfriend.
Much more serious than you know.
Agent Cooper,
the sheriff's ready to roll up to the site.
And I've got something else for you here.
You can come on in.
I know Laura was your best friend.
You've been through a lot today.
We're finished here for the time being.
Okay.
Go ahead, Lucy, tell Agent Cooper what you heard.
Okay.
Now, after you were done with Bobby and he was taken back to his cell,
well, then his parents were standing by the door with his lawyer,
and Bobby, he was released,
and he came out and he saw his friend Mike,
who was down by the water cooler,
which is near my desk. Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Okay, okay. Well, I pretended to be typing,
but I was typing what Mike and Bobby were saying.
And, well, they didn't say exactly who it was they were talking about,
but anyway, here's what they were saying.
They said the person we're looking for is a biker.
Yeah.
Looks like a hog to me.
Holy smoke.
Holy smoke.
The Norwegians are leaving. The Norwegians are leaving.
The Norwegians are gone.
Everybody gone? Not good. The Norwegians are leaving.
Norwegians are leaving. Listen to me.
You are throwing away the investment opportunity of a lifetime.
Better that than to throw a lifetime away.
You stay out of this!
Ha, ha. The Norwegians are leaving.
Sheriff.
Diane, it's 4:10 in the afternoon at the scene of the crime.
Here's something we haven't seen before.
A mound of dirt approximately a foot and a half in diameter.
On the top is a gold necklace with a gold heart.
Correction, half a gold heart.
At the base of the mound of dirt is a torn piece of newsprint
written with the words, which appear to be in blood:
"Fire walk with me."
Sheriff, you and I have gotta find out who's got the other half of that heart.
Mrs. Horne.
Mrs. Horne, it might help if you talk to Johnny yourself.
So you think it might help?
Well, you can tell Johnny one more time
that Laura isn't coming this afternoon to work with him.
Or tomorrow afternoon or any afternoon.
Now, what is so difficult to understand about that?
Thank you.
Oh, it fell down.
I knew Laura. She was always so nice.
When was the last time she came in?
Oh, I couldn't tell you exactly. Uh, we have so many boxes.
You don't keep records?
Well, we have plenty of paperwork.
Can you tell me how long she's had this box?
I'd say about six months.
Um, I could check for you.
Would you, please?
And close the door on the way out.
Okay. Thank you.
"Flesh World."
Man, oh, man.
There's over $10,000 here.
That's a lot of Girl Scout cookies.
Here's a page that's marked.
There's your connection.
Ronette Pulaski.
I can't believe it.
Local and federal law-enforcement officials
emerging from this abandoned railway car, which is believed to be...
Shelly, would you please turn the television set off?
Why, Leo? I wanna see this.
Ronette Pulaski, a second...
Shelly, turn it off.
Apparently escaped her captor and fled to safety,
remains hospitalized and in critical condition at Cal...
Shelly, sit down here a minute and help me out.
What kind of cigarettes do you smoke?
Whatever's around.
No, you don't.
You smoke these. What are these doing here?
Come on, Leo, I pick up different packs
from the diner all the time, me and Norma.
There's two things, Shelly.
When I come home, this house should be clean.
And I mean clean. Okay.
Number two, you smoke one brand of cigarettes from now on,
because if I ever see two different brands of cigarettes
in this house again, I'm gonna snap your neck like a twig.
Okay, Leo, you have nothing to worry about with me, darling.
That's right.
Big Ed's Gas Farm. This is Ed speaking.
I'm sorry, I know I promised not to call you there,
but I have to see you.
I feel so bad.
It's okay.
Why don't I, uh, meet you at the Roadhouse around 9:30?
Thank you, Ed.
I'll see you tonight.
All right, sweetheart.
I think I saw a cottontail rabbit.
It must have been a snowshoe rabbit.
Snowshoe? Right.
Snowshoe. Snowshoe rabbit.
Who's the babe?
That's one of the most beautiful women in the state.
Mrs. Packard.
Packard sawmill? Yeah.
Where's Mr. Packard?
Died in a boating accident last year.
Andrew Packard practically built this town.
Brought her over from Hong Kong six years ago.
Left her everything, which didn't exactly please his sister.
That's her right there.
The original deep freeze.
Who's the glad-handing dandy?
Benjamin Horne. Local bigwig. He owns half the town.
He's not after her, he's after her land.
Who's the lady with the log?
We call her the Log Lady.
Shh!
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention.
Is this thing on?
Is this thing on? Hang on, Dwayne.
Sorry. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Thank you, Mayor Milford.
Agent Cooper?
Thank you, sheriff.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Dale Cooper.
One year ago, almost to the day,
in a town in the southwest corner of this state,
the body of a young girl named Teresa Banks was found.
She had no family. No one came forward to claim her body.
It wasn't even news. Until today.
There are irrefutable similarities that for obvious reasons I cannot discuss
that lead us to conclude that Laura Palmer was the second,
and Ronette Pulaski would have been the third, victim of the same killer.
Now, there is a chance
that the person who committed these crimes
is someone from this town, possibly even someone you know.
You are the leaders of this community.
It is vitally important that this not turn into a witch hunt.
I would strongly suggest a temporary curfew
for those under 18 years of age.
Keeping your kids off the streets now may teach them a degree of caution
that may protect them in the days and the weeks to come.
I will remind you that these crimes occurred at night.
When I left the house, Sarah was sleeping.
Leland made it through the day somehow.
I'm not sure I could've done the same.
Poor dear. Poor Sarah.
Eileen, the brutality, the madness of it.
I know.
They're not releasing many details, wisely, I suppose.
At the scene where it happened... No one else knows this.
They found part of a necklace.
Half of a golden heart.
It was Laura's.
They know this because she was wearing it
in a video of a picnic they found.
The reason I'm telling you this
is that Donna was in the video with her,
and she won't tell them who shot it or who else was with them.
What?
But they think the killer may have the other half of the heart.
Donna, which do you like better:
"The blossom of the evening" or "the full flower of the evening"?
Now, listen to me. This is serious.
Well, this is serious too. Shh.
I'm going out the window in a few minutes
and I need you to cover for me.
Aren't you aware that there's a curfew?
They just announced it on the radio.
Yes, I know there's a curfew, Einstein. That's why I need you to cover for me.
I suppose this will include a phone conversation with Mike,
Mr. Bonehead-Boyfriend.
No, this is about Laura.
And it's really, really serious.
Check.
Okay, thank you. Ha, ha.
Oh, I'll need to borrow your bike.
Oh, well, then put a little air in the back tire, would you?
Yeah. Harriet, don't forget to brush your teeth.
Actually,
now that some time has passed,
I like "the full blossom of the evening."
Hey, Snake!
Don't take any oink-oink off that pretty pig.
Don't you worry about that.
Hi, Dr. Hayward. I'd, uh, like to talk to Donna.
Donna's upstairs getting ready for bed, Mike.
You're not drinking and driving, are you?
Well, we're all pretty broken up about what happened today, sir.
Besides, Bobby's doing most of the driving.
I'll see if she wants to come down.
Mike, would you mind waiting out here, please?
The best-laid plans of mice and men.
Snake, man. Let's go!
Where's your sister?
Dad, I'm gonna tell it to you and I'm gonna tell it to you straight.
Harriet.
See that window?
Later.
Donna's not here.
What do you mean? She snuck out?
Maybe you have an idea where she might have gone.
Maybe you can help us find her.
Oh, we'll find her. Don't you worry about that.
Roadhouse.
Let's go.
Sheriff, I got a call for you from Dr. Hayward.
I explained to him that you were on a stakeout at the Roadhouse
but he still would very much like to talk to you.
Go ahead, Lucy, patch him through.
I'm gonna patch him through to you now, sheriff.
I'm patching you through now, Dr. Hayward.
Harry, my daughter Donna
snuck out of the house.
I don't know where she's gone.
Doc, you rest easy now. I'm gonna put out an all-points for her.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
Thanks, Harry.
You betcha.
Lucy, you take care of that all-points now, okay?
All right, sheriff.
Of course Donna snuck out.
Meaning what?
Meaning how else is she gonna lead us to that biker?
Right.
Then I saw your smile
This whole afternoon I've been hanging drapes.
Drapes? Drapes.
Lots of them.
You know how I feel about you, Ed.
Don't do it for me, do it for yourself.
It's Tammy Wynette time, darling. Yeah?
What about you and Hank?
I told you, I'm gonna leave Hank.
Before or after he gets paroled?
I love you, Ed.
I'm gonna do what's best for both of us.
When your sweetheart's husband's in the joint for manslaughter,
the word "parole" has got a nasty ring to it.
Falling
Falling
Are we falling in love?
You know why I'm whittling?
Okay, I'll bite again. Why are you whittling?
Because that's what you do in a town
where a yellow light still means slow down, not speed up.
Mike and Bobby.
They're liable to be a little trouble this evening.
There is a love
Meant for me
The nightingale
It flew to me
And told me
That it found my love
Scotty, Mutt and Jeff just crawled in.
Oh, what a wonderful world.
Looks like sooner than later.
Why don't you whistle for a little backup?
I can see which way the wind's blowing.
Lucy, get us a backup unit down here at the Roadhouse right away.
Make that two backup units.
And call Dr. Hayward. Tell him we found his daughter and she's fine.
All right, sheriff.
Donna!
What are you sneaking around for? Everybody's looking for you.
You and Laura, you're the same. Get your hands off me!
Leave me alone. Get off me!
No! Get your hands off me!
Let go of me!
No! That's enough!
You heard him. Let me go.
Lights out, Mr. Monkey-Wrench.
You guys got it covered? That's right. No sweat.
Don't worry, I'll take you to James.
Joey Paulson.
That's a J. No, he's taking her to somebody else.
I suppose you want me to follow them at a discreet distance.
Harry, you're all right.
Hold on.
Do you think they spotted us?
Give me a doughnut.
Well, Harry, I think we lost them.
Man, smell those trees.
Smell those Douglas firs.
I think I hear them.
What's down there? An old logging road.
The only access is five miles back at the Packard Mill.
And I told Doc Hayward his daughter was okay.
My fault, Harry, not yours.
Thanks, Joey. No problem, James.
James, they're looking for you.
I'm gonna talk to them. But I think they're gonna lock me up.
Why?
I don't have an alibi for last night. I was with her.
James, what happened last night?
It was kind of like a nightmare.
Donna, she was a different person.
What are you saying?
I'm telling you, there were things she was involved with.
Things she let herself get pulled into. Things she thought you'd hate her for.
She said, "There are things about me."
She said, "Even Donna doesn't know me."
I knew her.
I knew her better than she thought I did.
Donna, she said something about a guy getting killed.
Who? She didn't say.
But she said
Bobby told her that he killed this guy.
Oh, my God.
This is why I had to see you.
It all makes some kind of terrible sense that she died, that someone killed her.
I don't know, I can't explain it.
I didn't know whether to believe any of this last night.
I mean, half the time she wasn't making any sense.
I couldn't calm her down.
I could hardly keep her on the bike.
We came to the light at Sparkwood and 21, and she...
She put her hands around my neck
and she screamed she loved me.
I looked into her eyes. They were clear.
It was like she was Laura again. She was so sad.
She sounded so desperate.
Then she ran off. I let her go and she died.
Oh, it's okay.
It's not your fault, James.
It's okay.
James, it's all right. James.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
I changed my mind.
I'm not sorry.
James...
Oh, James.
Those are sirens.
I've got to go to the police.
I don't have an alibi.
After she left, I just rode around most of the night.
James, the necklace you gave Laura with the golden heart.
You have to give me the other half.
Why?
Because they found the half where she was killed
and they think the killer will have the other half.
If you go down there with the necklace and no alibi...
What about you? I'll get rid of it.
No. I'll hide it.
All right. We'll bury it.
Okay.
Right here. Okay.
I'll take you home.
What goes around comes around. Around and around.
That's not Joey, that's James Hurley. He'll do.
James, stand away from the bike. Stand away from the girl.
Put your hands behind your head.
He didn't do anything.
She's probably right.
James...
He didn't do anything.
Lucy, get an arrest form ready.
Doc, I'm gonna release her to you,
but I want her back up here for questioning first thing in the morning.
All right, Harry.
Andy, Hawk, put James back in Number 4.
James.
It's gonna be all right.
You.
We'll be back to check on you later.
Good night, officers.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Donna, after what happened today, I'm sure you understand
what you put your mother and me through tonight.
But I also know you well enough to know you wouldn't have done it
unless you had a good reason.
But we also have another problem facing us, young lady.
Where's your sister's bicycle?
Uh, I left it at the Roadhouse.
Well, we'll have to go get it.
I understand you promised Harriet you'd put some air in the back tire.
Yes, I did.
We're so thankful to have a daughter like you.
A policeman's dream.
Yeah. Lucy sets it up for us every night.
Sheriff, is everything okay?
There's extra jelly doughnuts for Agent Cooper
and there's some extra decaf.
You know, Andy's been drinking so much caffeinated coffee lately...
Thank you, Lucy.
You can go back to work now, and no listening.
Sheriff, that reminds me.
Can you recommend to me a good inexpensive hotel or motel?
Now, it doesn't have to be fancy, and I mean that.
I can get you a good rate up at The Great Northern.
Because, you know, I think I'm gonna be here for some time,
and these motels, they'll promise you a good rate,
and when you get there it's a whole different story.
Now, all I need is a bed, a bathroom, a telephone,
and sometimes a television, in the unlikely event that one day
I'll get a chance to knock off early.
I can get you a good rate up at The Great Northern.
Sold.
Well, tomorrow comes early.
Diane, it's 12:28 a.m.
Looks like I'll be staying locally at a place called The Great Northern Hotel.
Sheriff's getting me a rate.
When you least expect it.
Hello, sheriff.
Hey, Jo.
I understand you wanted to see the sheriff up here.
Yes, I did.
Right over here.
He's here again.
Let's get together and talk about it.
All right.
It must have happened about this time 24 hours ago.
I'm afraid.
﻿1
Diane, 6:18 a.m., Room 315.
Great Northern Hotel up here in Twin Peaks.
Slept pretty well. Non-smoking room. There's no tobacco smell.
That's a nice consideration for the business traveler.
A hint of Douglas fir needles in the air.
As Sheriff Truman indicated they would,
everything this hotel promised, they've delivered.
Clean, reasonably priced accommodations.
Telephone works. Bathroom in really tiptop shape.
No drips, plenty of hot water and good, steady pressure.
That could be a side benefit of the waterfall outside my window.
Mattress firm, but not too firm.
And no lumps like that time I told you about down in El Paso.
What a nightmare that was.
But you've heard me tell that story once or twice,
haven't you, Diane?
Haven't tried the television set yet.
Looks like cable, probably no reception problems.
But the true test of any hotel, as you well know, Diane,
is that morning cup of coffee,
which I'll be getting back to you about within a half hour.
Diane, it struck me again earlier this morning.
There are two things that continue to trouble me
and I'm speaking now not only as an agent of the Bureau,
but also as a human being.
What really went on between Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys?
And who really pulled the trigger on JFK?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You know, this is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee.
I've had I can't tell you how many cups of coffee in my life and this...
This is one of the best.
Now, I'd like two eggs, over hard.
I know, don't tell me, it's hard on the arteries.
But old habits die hard.
Just about as hard as I want those eggs.
Bacon, super crispy, almost burned. Cremate it.
That's great.
And I'll have the grapefruit juice.
Just as long as those grapefruits...
...are freshly squeezed.
My name's Audrey Horne.
Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Dale Cooper.
Can I sit here?
Well, Miss Horne, unless I miss my guess,
your father is Benjamin Horne, the owner of this fine establishment.
So I imagine you can sit anywhere you'd like.
I'd also like to add it would be my pleasure.
Thank you.
You're here investigating the murder of Laura Palmer?
Were you friends with Laura Palmer?
Not exactly.
See, Laura tutored my older brother, Johnny, three times a week.
Johnny's 27 and he's in the third grade.
He's got emotional problems.
Runs in the family.
Do you like my ring?
Very nice.
You know, sometimes I get so flushed, it's interesting.
Do your palms ever itch?
Morning, deputy. Hey, Lucy.
Good morning, Agent Cooper.
Agent Cooper, I got jelly for you special.
The sheriff's in the conference room. It's the door across from the...
I'll look for him in the conference room.
Hey, three for three.
Sheriff, let's get James Hurley up from cell 4 and talk to him straight.
He was in love with Laura Palmer. My bet is she told him whatever dirt
she knew about Mike and Bobby and who knows what else.
Then let's have a little chat with those two perpetrators.
Let's run a top-to-bottom on Bobby's vehicle, see what that brings us.
Also check on the autopsy on Laura Palmer
and see what that brings in.
We're also gonna wanna talk to Mr. and Mrs. Palmer,
let's give them a few days to deal with their grief.
I've got the rest of our day mapped out, let's meet back here in three minutes.
Harry, I really have to urinate.
Oh. By the way, coffee at the Great Northern?
Incredible.
Harry, as you know, I delivered Laura.
I've known her all her life. She was my daughter's best friend.
I couldn't bring myself to do the postmortem,
so I called Joe Fielding in from Fairvale.
He did the work, I assisted.
Well, this is what he found.
Time of death estimated to be between midnight and 4 a.m.
What killed her is loss of blood.
Numerous shallow wounds,
no single one serious enough to have caused death.
Bite marks on her shoulders, also on her tongue.
Probably self-inflicted.
Lesions on wrists, ankles, upper arms, where she was bound.
We're waiting on the toxological tests for drug use.
Within the last 12 hours,
she'd had sexual relations with at least three men.
You've examined Ronnette Pulaski as well?
Yes, sir. There's no question in my mind.
The same perpetrator attacked both of them in that train car.
Doc, when, if ever, will Ronnette be able to talk to us?
She had a severe head injury, it's still early to tell.
Add to that the psychological impact of the fear,
probably witnessing what was happening to Laura before she...
So beautiful.
Who would do a thing like that?
Leo.
Leo, honey, I have to go to work now and Norma should be here any sec.
Leo?
Did you finish cleaning my boots?
Yeah, I did them and I did the laundry too.
All of it?
Well, yeah.
No, you didn't.
Okay, Leo, when I get home, I'll do it.
Now, Shelly.
Okay.
Blood.
Shelly? Norma's here.
Shelly, did you hear me say Norma's here?
Yeah, I heard you, Leo.
I'm gonna come by the diner sometime today.
Be a good girl and save me a piece of pie.
Sure, Leo.
James, you were placed under arrest for suspicion of murder.
The murder of Laura Palmer.
Now, you have no previous criminal record, is that correct?
None. No, sir.
Did you shoot this video?
That's your cycle, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
The three of us went up there two Sundays ago.
James, you were in love with Laura.
The two of you were seeing each other secretly.
No one else at school or any of her friends knew about it.
She was the homecoming queen,
she was dating the captain of the football team.
How much longer did you think
you could keep this relationship a secret?
Yeah, well, it was secret because that's the way she wanted it.
Why? Was she afraid of Bobby?
I think so.
Did you know she was using cocaine?
Yes.
Did you ever use cocaine with her?
No, I tried to get her to stop.
And she did for a while. Why did she start using again?
Something happened a couple of days ago.
What? What happened?
I don't know.
I think something scared her because she wouldn't see me.
She wouldn't even talk to me.
When was the last time you saw her?
The night she died.
She snuck out of her house about 9:30.
About 12:30, I stopped the bike at the light at Sparkwood and 21.
And she jumped off and ran away.
I didn't see her again.
Did you and Laura have a fight?
Not exactly.
But she said she couldn't see me anymore.
Why?
She didn't say.
You recognize this necklace?
Yes, sir.
James, what happened on February 5th?
And who has the other half of this heart?
James, guess why I'm so happy today.
Because your skin is so soft and you smell so good?
No. Why?
Because I really believe that you love me.
Now my heart belongs to you.
I don't know.
Damn it.
Where's that shirt?
No!
Hey, Bopper.
Since when does Leo Johnson call me at my parents' house?
Leo called you?
Yeah, yesterday. He was looking for you.
He wanted to know where the other half of the money was.
What did you tell him, Snake?
Well, as far as I knew, he didn't have any of it yet.
Because I thought the deal was
we were supposed to give it to him today.
Yeah, well,
I gave him half already.
When did you see him?
Hey, I saw him the other night, okay? What night?
The night Laura died.
I went to see Leo
because I had this money burning a $10,000 hole in my pocket.
What about the other half?
It's in Laura's safe-deposit box. So you didn't get it back from her?
She was supposed to hand it over today.
Then she went and checked out on us.
So how are we supposed to get 10 grand for Leo?
I don't know, Snake.
Maybe we could sell light bulbs door to door.
Oh, that's great, that's just... That's just great.
This isn't funny, Bobby. I'm not laughing.
We're lucky. We're lucky we're in jail.
Because you know what's gonna go down with Leo when we get out.
Shut up, man.
Don't mention one word about Leo Johnson.
You do not know Leo Johnson.
Help me.
Mom.
Hi, honey.
Mom, it's 10:30. Why didn't you wake me?
I was supposed to go to the sheriff's office.
They called this morning
and said they could wait until tomorrow to see you.
Your father and I thought you needed your rest.
You woke us crying in your sleep last night.
Do you remember? No.
Really?
We feel so badly for you.
We're so sorry.
Mom, it's so strange.
I know I should be sad, and I am. Part of me is.
But it's like...
It's like I'm having the most beautiful dream
and the most terrible nightmare all at once.
Your father said you went out last night
to meet a boy named James Hurley.
Does this have anything to do with him?
Can this be between you and me?
Of course it can.
James and Laura were seeing each other the last two months.
I was the only one who knew about it.
Mom, James was so good for her.
You don't know how troubled Laura was.
Last night, I had to see him.
We were the two closest people in the world to her.
But I feel so bad now.
Why, angel?
Because we realized...
...that all this time...
...we were the ones falling in love.
So I feel like I've betrayed my best friend.
And if it's true,
then why am I so happy?
Oh, honey.
Now, you tell me what you wanna do.
Should we see these guys separately or together?
No, no, we can see them together. Okay.
Hey, Ed.
How's that coconut? Well, it's kind of tender.
But my pride hurts worse.
Ed, this is Special Agent Dale Cooper.
Pleasure. Any relation to James?
I'm his uncle and he works in my garage.
His mother's out of town and I look after him when she's away.
You fellas plan on holding him?
No, we can, uh, release him into your custody.
Well, let me understand. Is James being charged?
Well, I had one small doubt which he cleared up for me.
He didn't kill anybody.
But you tell him to be careful
because we're gonna have to release Mike and Bobby today as well.
Will do. Agent Cooper,
I've got a call for you from a Mr. Albert Rosenfield.
Sounds like long distance.
Excuse me. Sure.
It has that open air sound, you know, where it sounds like wind blowing?
Like wind blowing through trees. Yes, Albert.
Harry, I've been thinking about last night at the Roadhouse.
And something's not right.
Yeah, when I first saw that bandage,
I thought maybe old Nadine caught wind of you and Norma.
Harry, if Nadine got wind of me and Norma,
I'd be playing harp for the Heavenly All-Stars.
Ain't that the truth?
I was there seeing Norma, but I was also on my stakeout.
And I can remember Mike and Bobby grabbing Donna
and I got up to walk over and I got all lightheaded.
I was out on my feet before I got there.
I don't even remember getting hit.
What do you mean you don't remember?
Well, I'm pretty sure my beer was drugged.
Jacques Renault was tending bar.
All right, Albert, bring the boys.
You can have the body all day tomorrow.
No, I can't do it, they're gonna put her in the ground on Monday.
Albert, listen.
If you come up through Lewis Fork, I can recommend a place for lunch.
The Lamplighter Inn.
They got a cherry pie there that'll kill you.
Hi, Nadine. What are you doing here, Norma?
I might ask you the same question.
And I will tell you.
I've gotten all new drapes for my house.
Ed bought them for me yesterday at Gentleman Jim's.
And we installed them together.
They're a beige sheer.
I was up all last night. Do you know what I was doing?
No, I don't.
I was inventing a noiseless, completely silent drape runner.
And do you know how it works? Do you know what makes it work?
The thing I thought of at 4 this morning
when I was waiting for my husband to be released from intensive care?
Cotton balls.
By God, those things will be quiet now.
Did you have to post bail?
No, I had a talk with Harry. There's no charge.
Mom still out of town?
Yeah, she's still out of town. Let's get out of here.
Gonna need a hand from the Bookhouse Boys.
Somebody's gotta watch my back. Already got it covered.
Hi, Mike.
Bobby.
Well, before we get started, have you two fellas got your stories straight?
If we tell the truth, we don't have to get our stories straight.
Besides, the sheriff told us we're just in here for fighting.
And, uh, it was self-defense.
Right.
Well, I guess you can go, then.
Now? Mm-hm.
Oh, fellas, one more thing.
Pray for the health and safety of James Hurley
because if anything happens to him, we're coming for you.
Sheriff, what are you sitting around for?
We got places to go and people to see.
Yeah, I think I better start studying medicine.
Why's that?
Because I'm beginning to feel a bit like Dr. Watson.
On top of the morning to you, Pete.
Uh, no, Josie, the expression is "top of the morning."
And it's just barely morning.
Pete,
I want to thank you for yesterday. For standing up to me with Catherine.
Forget it. Catherine was wrong yesterday.
Period. Well, thank you anyway.
Hello. Pete, it's Harry.
I got Agent Cooper with me. We're here to see Mrs. Packard.
Um, I will make a fresh pot of coffee.
Hi, sheriff. Mrs. Packard.
Dale Cooper, FBI.
You remember him from the town meeting last night, I'm sure.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Agent Cooper, you remember Pete Martell.
Sure, Pete. You bet.
Uh, can we offer you gentlemen a cup of joe?
Mrs. Packard, you said the magic word.
I'd love a cup, thanks. Sure, I'll pour that for you.
Uh, Mr. Cooper, uh, how do you take it?
Black as midnight on a moonless night.
Pretty black.
Um, please sit down. Thank you.
Mrs. Packard, I'll come straight to the point.
Mrs. Packard, I understand that you hired Laura Palmer
to come visit you twice a week to help you with your English, is that correct?
Yes.
When was the last time that you saw her?
Thursday afternoon, about the time the mill blew 5.
That would be 5:00? Yes.
And when did she leave?
In an hour, when the lesson was finished.
I didn't see her again.
How did she seem to you on Thursday afternoon?
Something was bothering her.
But we didn't have a heart-to-heart on it.
Something she said though, that stuck on my mind.
She said,
"I think now I understand how you feel about your husband's death."
Did she say what that was in reference to?
No.
But after what happened to her, I can't help hearing it in my head.
Like some haunting melody.
Hmm.
Excuse me. Certainly.
So, Harry, how long you been seeing her?
How did you know?
Body language.
Jeez Louise.
Not long. Six weeks.
Andrew died a year and a half ago.
Fellas, don't drink that coffee.
You'd never guess. There was a fish in the percolator.
Sorry.
Yes, Catherine, I'm listening.
I just thought you ought to know
what your sentimental, goodwill shenanigans cost us yesterday.
You do know what shenanigans are, don't you?
Shutting down the mill cost us $87,000 and change.
You really think that would have made brother Andrew happy.
Jocelyn? Mrs. Packard?
Uh, what is "shenanigans?"
Nonsense, mischief, often a deceitful or treacherous trick.
Why do you always have to rush off?
It's been over an hour.
I remember there was a time
when we used to take the whole afternoon.
In the sweetness of passing time, this hour will soon seem like a day.
Sing it to somebody else. I'm no peabrain chambermaid
looking for a tumble in the broom closet.
I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to offend your delicate sensibilities.
Oh, no. My mistake.
I'd gotten used to our conducting business and pleasure.
Sweetheart,
it's all the same to me.
Don't "sweetheart" me, you old dog.
I'm no schoolgirl either.
What's the next step?
Do we escalate?
We may not have to do anything.
A few more, uh, local tragedies
and Josie might just run the old mill into the ground all by herself.
The rate we're going, it's gonna be years before the mill's bankrupt.
I don't wanna wait any longer.
Besides, my knothead husband may peek in the ledger
and sniff out the creative arithmetic.
Maybe it's time to, uh, start a little fire.
Are you talking about business or pleasure?
I'm talking about the Packard sawmill.
All that dry timber lying around.
A stray spark.
One night.
Some night when Pete's off on a toot with Smokey the Bear.
Now I remember...
...how all those hours turned into days.
Sarah, darling.
I'm sorry to disturb you, sweetheart,
but, uh, Donna Hayward is here.
Take this now.
I'll send her in.
Try not to upset her. Okay.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I miss her so much.
Do you miss her?
Yes, I miss her so much.
I miss her so much.
Laura.
Oh, Laura, my baby.
Oh. Oh.
Leland, Leland.
So neither of you saw Ronnette after school that day?
That's right.
And as far as you know, she went to her after-school job?
Yes, Horne's Department Store downtown.
What did she do at the department store?
She was, uh, a salesgirl.
At perfume counter.
She used to joke it was the sweetest smelling job she'd ever had.
Excuse me.
How many times have I asked you
not to disturb the guests with this racket?
About 4000.
Audrey,
Julie tells me that, uh, you were in with the Norwegians
just before they all suddenly decided, en masse,
to return to the old country...
...without signing the contracts.
Is that true?
Yes. Ah.
You wouldn't have, uh, done or said anything
that, uh, might have precipitated their evacuation, would you?
I mean, I'm assuming that this was just a coincidence.
Huh? Daddy.
I did go in there to check out that ridiculous smorgasbord.
And while I was in there, I happened to mention that I was sad.
About what?
About my dear, close friend Laura being brutally murdered.
Do you realize
the kind of money that your little performance just cost this family?
If you ever pull another stunt like that,
you are going to be scrubbing bidets in a Bulgarian convent.
Oh, Daddy, I'm so afraid.
Laura died two days ago.
I lost you years ago.
For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful.
Amen.
Robert, uh, I was hoping we'd have the chance
to discuss the events of the past few days.
Not necessarily the physical events themselves,
but rather, the thoughts and feelings surrounding it.
Rebellion in a young man your age is a necessary fact of life.
Candidly, a sign of strength.
In other words, Robert,
I respect your rebellious nature.
However, being your father,
I am obligated to contain that fire of contrariness
within the bounds established by society
as well as those within our own family structure.
Robert, I note your reluctance to enter into a dialogue with me, your father.
There are times when silence is golden.
Silence can be taken many ways, as a sign of intelligence.
The quieter we become, the more we hear.
Ah!
Now, I am a tolerant man. My patience has its limits.
To have his path made clear is the aspiration of every human being
in our beclouded and tempestuous existence.
Robert, you and I are going to work to make yours real clear.
We're here for you, Bobby.
Can I get you anything to go with that, sheriff?
Agent Cooper here might wanna try a slice of that pie.
Cherry pie? Best in the tri-counties.
Hmm.
And could you ask Norma to stop by a second, Shelly?
Sure thing. Nothing's a sure thing, Shelly.
Man, I still can't get the taste of that fish-filtered coffee
out of my mouth. Me neither.
That's Shelly Johnson, with a J? Mm-hm.
Husband's a trucker, Leo.
Minor rap sheet.
Log Lady?
Right. Hi.
Can I ask her about her log?
Many have.
Evening, Harry.
Norma, like to have you meet Special Agent Dale Cooper.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Norma Jennings.
Miss Jennings, is it true that Laura used to help you
with the Meals on Wheels program,
delivering hot dinners to elderly shut-ins?
Yeah, Laura helped organize that program.
Do you have the names of the people on her route?
I can get them for you. Mm. Would you, please?
And, uh, two more pieces of this incredible pie.
Okay.
Man, oh, man, you must have the metabolism of a bumblebee.
For your information,
I heard you speaking about Laura Palmer.
Yes.
One day, my log will have something to say about this.
My log saw something that night.
Really? What did it see?
Ask it.
I thought so.
Thanks, Norma. See you tomorrow.
Hi, Leo.
Brought you some pie.
Where's my shirt?
What shirt?
My favorite blue shirt.
It's the second one you lost this year.
I'm gonna teach you a lesson now, Shelly,
about taking care of my property.
That means making sure things aren't lost or damaged.
Oh, God, please, Leo.
This is gonna hurt you. No.
No!
I'll get it.
Come on.
Uh, Mom, Dad, this is James. James Hurley.
How do you do, James? Nice to see you, sir, Mrs. Hayward.
Very nice to meet you, James.
Well, I hope you're hungry.
Eileen's been cooking up a storm. Yes, sir.
Would you like something to drink?
We have some soft drinks and some fruit punch,
some sparkling cider.
Uh, fruit punch. That'd be good, thank you.
I'll get it. Okay.
Uh, why don't you fellas sit down at the table
and I'll go check on the roast.
Here's your fruit punch. Thanks, Donna.
I don't believe I know your parents, James.
No, sir. My dad died when I was 10 and my mom travels a lot.
She writes for the paper sometimes. Oh.
Ed Hurley down at the Gas Farm is James' uncle.
His, uh, wife's the lady with the patch.
Yes, sir, that's my Aunt Nadine. She's a real character.
Will? Could you come give me a hand, please?
Uh, excuse me.
We can talk after dinner.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
That bastard.
First your girlfriend, then mine.
Too bad we can only kill him once.
Hey, what's up, doc?
It's Laura Palmer in case you haven't guessed.
I'm making you another one of these tapes,
which, as you already know,
I've mailed to you in one of the envelopes you gave me.
It's Thursday the 23rd and I'm so bored.
Actually, I'm in kind of a weird mood.
God, James is sweet, but he's so dumb.
I should have met you a long time ago, Dr. Jacoby,
because right now, I can take just so much of sweet.
I just know I'm gonna get lost in those woods again tonight.
I just know it.
Remember me telling you about that mystery man?
Well...
﻿1
No, no. No, not in my room, in here. In here.
Jerry, back from Paris?
Ben, what a nightmare. Right there, no, no, right there.
What is with you guys?
I've got a sandwich in there, I want all those bags opened.
We're looking until we find it.
Hey, Audrey, Uncle Jerry's back. Heh.
Sylvia. Benjamin.
Okay, okay. Go on. Goodbye.
Brother Ben, this is the best damn sandwich I ever ate.
It's a baguette, with Brie and butter.
I had four of these damn things every day I was there.
You got to try this thing.
Here, go ahead, eat it, go ahead.
Go ahead.
Oh, yeah.
Mm.
Mm. Mm!
Mm! This is incredible, Jer.
You know what this reminds us of? You know who likes this?
It reminds us of Ginny and Jenny's down by the river.
Hmm? By God, you're right.
Am I right? Am I right? Hmm?
Oh, no wonder.
Mm. Mm!
Mm. Jer.
Outside, outside, outside.
Mm. Oh.
Always a pleasure.
Mm. Incredible. Incredible.
Mm. Jer.
Leland's daughter was murdered and the Norwegians left.
Did they sign?
Deal's off.
Oh!
We had those Vikings by the horns, what happened?
We're not a hundred percent sure, they took their translator with them.
Did you say Leland's daughter was murdered?
Yes.
Ugh, I'm depressed.
I can fix that.
There's a new girl at One-Eyed Jack's.
Freshly scented from the perfume counter.
And you, brother Jer,
have a 50-50 chance of being first in line.
I like those odds.
All work and no play make Ben and Jerry dull boys.
That's right.
Let's jump in the boat.
That's great huckleberry pie, Mrs. Hayward.
Thank you, James.
Well...
Mrs. Hayward and I are gonna say good night, James.
Good night, James.
Good night.
Good night, dear. Good night, Mom.
Uh, don't worry about the dishes. I'll clean up.
Are you, uh, coming to church with us in the morning, Donna?
Yes.
Nine o'clock sharp. Okay.
Good night, James. Good night, sir.
Hi, sailor.
Good evening, Mr. Horne.
Ah, heh-heh.
Now, Ben, we're not gonna go in the casino first, are we?
Jer, I didn't come here to lose my shirt, I just came to take it off.
Yeah.
Kim, the Horne brothers are here. I'll tell Blackie.
Sweetheart, I'd like to order two drinks.
One double Scotch on the rocks and my brother would like
a double Scotch on the rocks.
That's two double Scotch on the rocks.
Next stop, rocket science.
Jerry.
Ah.
Blackie. Benjamin.
Mm.
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And every fair from fair sometimes declines,
By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
Nor shall death brag... Where's the new girl?
When you really want love,
you'll find it waiting for you.
Heads.
Ah.
Come on. We'll take care of you, Jerry.
Well...
Donna, I don't think
that what we're feeling or doing is wrong.
Why not?
Because it's the truth.
Because I think it would have turned out this way anyway.
You do?
Yes.
I remember a time in school, in the hall,
we were suddenly alone and we looked at each other.
I almost told you I loved you then.
It's true.
It is true, isn't it?
Oh, James.
I guess because of Laura I couldn't say anything.
I couldn't even let myself think it. Me too.
Are we gonna be together, James?
Are we?
Are we, James?
Special Agent Dale Cooper.
Hello, it's Hawk.
Deputy Hawk, how is Ronette Pulaski?
Body and spirit are still far apart.
What did you find out from her parents?
Ronette recently quit her job
at the perfume counter of Horne's department store.
Everything else is quiet, except this afternoon
there was a one-armed man snooping around intensive care.
A one-armed man?
Left.
Did you question him?
Negative. I pursued but he got away.
Maintain an around-the-clock watch on Ronette
and we'll speak in the morning.
You got it?
Supposed to leave it in this stupid football.
Is it in there?
Not all of it.
Cash on delivery, Bobby.
He's got a gun.
Hey, Leo. Hey.
Who's that?
Is there someone with you?
Never mind. Toss it over here, quarterback.
It's empty. Is that right?
Weren't you supposed to leave something in there for me?
This barely covers what we paid for.
Where's the rest? Where's the rest of the money?
There's a... There's a problem.
Problem?
Laura had the other half, in a safe deposit box.
You think you got problems?
We can get it, Leo. Just wait till everything settles down.
You punks owe me 10 grand.
Leo needs a new pair of shoes.
Okay.
We won't take delivery on the drugs until you get the cash.
Do I look like a bank?
I appreciate your position.
But this thing with Laura, how can I anticipate that kind of thing?
Hey, man, Laura was a wild girl.
Tell me about it.
Maybe. Someday.
Take your hand out of your pocket, Mike.
What is your problem, Leo?
Problem?
You want to know about problems?
Okay.
You're on the road.
Driving back and forth. Gone for days.
You get back and guess what?
What?
You find out your old lady's been giving it away.
Yeah? Yeah.
Stepping out in your own damn bedroom.
That's a problem.
I guess so.
I guess it is.
Do you know who? A man needs a clean house.
Sure, yeah.
So do you know who?
I'll take care of it.
Sure you will, man.
This other thing, hell, we'll take care of that,
don't you worry about that.
We'll get the cash and everything will be square.
Go out for a pass.
What?
Go out for a pass. Okay.
Just... Run.
Just take it easy. Run!
Take it easy. Easy.
Run! Take it easy.
Damn it. I'm done, Bobby.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Ed. I'm sorry, honey, I didn't see it there.
You stepped on my drape runner.
Well, honey, it was right out in the middle of the floor.
You think that's an accident?
I laid those out there myself.
I was up all night working on that invention.
I'm going to have the world's first 100 percent quiet runner.
I'm real sorry, Nadine.
Ed, you make me sick.
That's it.
Exactly 60 feet, six inches.
It's perfect.
What do you think he's up to?
It beats me.
Invitation to love.
Each day brings a new beginning.
And every hour holds the promise of an Invitation to Love.
Right.
Who is it?
Hey, baby, it's the big bad bobcat.
Are you crazy? What are you doing here?
I just passed Leo, he started to diesel up out in North Bend.
We got at least 20 minutes. Oh, God.
Where's your car?
Parked in the woods, come on.
Open sesame. Somebody might see me out here and that'd be worse.
Bobby, you cannot come by here like this.
We can't see each other for a while.
What the hell happened to you?
Leo Johnson happened to me.
That bastard.
Come here.
Bobby, if he finds out about us, he's gonna kill you.
He'll kill us both.
If he ever does this to you again, I'll kill him.
I mean it.
Bobby.
Cup of coffee.
It's not the first time, it won't be the last,
but I'm in that doghouse again.
What happened this time?
Well, I popped a grease gun,
stepped on a drape runner and all hell broke loose.
I ran into Nadine in the hardware store.
That's all she talked about were those drape runners.
She's got one big bee in her bonnet.
Young Bobby sure gave me a good one didn't he?
Where do you want these rocks?
Put them right down there by the doughnuts, deputy.
Anyone for a warm-up?
Yes. You bet. You bet.
Right over here. Thanks, Lucy.
Damn good coffee.
And hot.
Would everyone please take a seat?
Ah.
By way of explaining what we're about to do,
I am first going to tell you a little bit
about the country called
Tibet.
An extremely spiritual country,
for centuries the leader of Tibet has been known as the Dalai Lama.
In 1950, Communist China invaded Tibet
and while leaving the Dalai Lama nominally in charge,
they in fact seized control of the entire country.
In 1959, after a Tibetan uprising against the Chinese,
the Dalai Lama was forced to flee to India
for his life and has lived in exile ever since.
Following a dream I had three years ago,
I have become deeply moved by the plight of the Tibetan people
and filled with a desire to help them.
I also awoke from the same dream realizing
that I had subconsciously gained knowledge of a deductive technique,
involving mind-body coordination operating hand in hand
with the deepest level of intuition.
Sheriff, Deputy Hawk, if you will please assist me,
I will now demonstrate.
You will recall on the day of her death
Laura Palmer wrote the following entry in her diary:
"Nervous about meeting J tonight."
Today, we're going to concentrate on the J's.
Harry, when I give the word, would you please read aloud
each of the names I've written on the blackboard.
Okey-doke. Deputy Hawk, stand over here
and hold this bucket of rocks up near me where I can get to them.
Would you please put on the kitchen mittens?
Deputy Andy, move down,
stand by the bottle.
Lucy, take this piece of chalk.
Not too near, Andy.
I'm getting excited.
If I should strike the bottle after Sheriff Truman
says a particular name, make a check to the right of that name.
Oh. Sheriff, I almost forgot, when you say the name,
also briefly state that person's relationship to Laura Palmer.
Ready?
Ready. Ready.
James Hurley.
Secret boyfriend.
James Hurley.
Josie Packard. Was instructed in English by Laura.
Josie Packard.
So there's no check next to either of these names?
That's correct, please continue.
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby, Laura's psychiatrist.
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby.
You did it, you hit it.
Lucy, make a note that the bottle was struck
but did not break.
Very important. Okay.
Andy, put that bottle back exactly where it was.
Johnny Horne.
Laura was his special education tutor.
Johnny Horne.
Norma Jennings.
She helped Laura organize the Meals on Wheels program.
Norma Jennings.
Shelly Johnson.
Waitress at diner, friend.
Shelly Johnson.
Sorry, Andy. Sweetie?
It didn't hurt.
It didn't hurt a bit.
Where there's no sense, there's no feeling, Andy.
Cooper.
Tell me.
The idea for all this really came from a dream?
Yes. It did.
Uh, Jack with One Eye.
Maybe it's the letter I, but there's no I in Jack.
I think perhaps it means he only had one eye, Lucy.
Sounds like, uh, Nadine, Big Ed Hurley's wife.
No, no, no, there's a casino up north called One-Eyed Jack's,
across the border on the Canadian side.
That's it, we're gonna go and check that place out.
Okay.
Agent Cooper, I'm going to erase this because it's a place and not a person.
Actually, maybe the person could be in the place.
So should I erase it? Yes.
Yes, a person could be in a place, or yes, I should...?
Lucy. Erase it, Lucy.
Next name, Harry.
Leo Johnson.
Husband of Shelly, drives a truck, connection with Laura...
Unknown. Leo Johnson.
Ah!
Little Audrey Horne just walked in.
Yeah, I saw her at church. Wonder what she's doing down here.
Hi, Audrey. Hi, Norma.
Can I have a cup of coffee, please? Sure.
Remind me to stop at the hardware store to get those 60-watt bulbs.
Thanks.
I'm gonna go say hi.
Hi.
Hi, Donna.
So my parents said they saw you at church today.
I didn't see you.
Yeah, I came by because of Laura.
What do you mean?
I didn't even think you liked her.
There were things about Laura I didn't like,
but she did help to take care of my brother Johnny.
Guess I sort of loved her for that.
Do you like coffee?
Yeah. With cream and sugar.
Agent Cooper loves coffee.
Audrey.
But Agent Cooper likes his coffee black.
Can I ask you something? Sure.
Did Laura ever talk about my father?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
No, what do you mean?
He used to sing to her.
God, I love this music.
Isn't it too dreamy?
Can you believe this?
Hawk found this half mile down the tracks from the crime site.
Oh, it's a nasty piece of work.
Tell Agent Cooper that Albert and his team are here.
Albert? A-L-B-E-R-T.
Are we gonna have to stand here all afternoon?
No. Albert Rosenfield.
R-O-S-E-N-F-l-E-L-D.
Sheriff, this is Lucy.
Is Agent Cooper with you?
Yes, he is.
Are Albert and his team here, Lucy?
Yes, he is. They are.
We're on our way.
Agent Cooper will be right with you.
Yeah, I can hear perfectly well, Curly.
Harry, Albert and his team are cream of the crop.
Albert's a forensic genius.
If they're working for you, I wouldn't expect anything less.
But I got to warn you. Albert's lacking in some of the social niceties.
Nobody's perfect. Isn't that the truth?
What the hell kind of a two-bit operation
they running out of this tree house, Cooper?
Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.
I have seen some slipshod backwater burgs,
but this place takes the cake.
What are you waiting for, Christmas? Got work to do.
They're putting this girl in the ground tomorrow,
and we've wasted half the day traveling here to the middle of nowhere.
Well, Albert, I suggest you and your team should get started.
I'll have one of my men escort you over to the morgue.
That'd be fine.
Results from the local pathologist's report.
Welcome to amateur hour.
Looks like an all nighter, boys.
Albert.
Got a minute?
I hear that you're real good at what you do.
Yeah, that's correct. Well, that's good.
Because normally if a stranger walked into my station talking this kind of crap,
he'd be looking for his teeth two blocks up on queer street.
Good night, Ed.
Ed, is that you?
Yeah, honey, it's me.
Ed! Oh, my God.
Oh, Ed, I'm so happy, sweetheart, I have to thank you.
Why's that?
You don't know what you've done for me?
No, I don't.
Oh, Ed, you big lug.
When you tracked all that grease into the house today,
you spilled some on my cotton balls,
but instead of tossing them out, I put the greased ones on the runners,
and, Ed, just listen to this.
Completely silent.
How about that?
Oh, Ed.
We are gonna be so rich.
Everything smells like fish around here.
Well, you could wash your socks separately.
What did that FBI man want up here today?
Very nice fellow.
Asked a few questions.
About what?
Oh, he talked to Josie mostly.
I had a problem with a fish.
Took a liking to my percolator.
What did he want to talk to Josie about?
Why don't you ask her?
Here's the key, the ledger's inside.
Thank you. You betcha.
Didn't he want to talk to me?
Yeah, but we told him you were on your world tour,
he should contact your press agent.
Get your boots off my bed and go to your room!
I didn't want to get mink oil on my bedspread.
You got mink oil on your head.
Two books.
Oh.
Leland?
Leland, stop it. We have to dance.
We have to dance, Sarah. We have to dance.
For Laura.
Oh, Leland, stop it. Give that to me, give it to me.
We have to dance. Leland, Leland.
Give it to me.
What is going on in this house?
Leland, what is going on in this house?
Oh, God!
Laura.
Laura.
Through the darkness of future pasts The magician longs to see
One chants out between two worlds
"Fire, walk with me"
We lived among the people.
I think you say, convenience store.
We lived above it.
I mean it like it is, like it sounds.
I, too, have been touched by the devilish one.
Tattoo on the left shoulder.
Ah, but when I saw the face of God, I was changed.
I took the entire arm off.
My name is Mike.
His name is Bob.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear me?
Catch you with my Death Bag.
You may think I've gone insane.
But I promise
I will kill again.
But it is Laura Palmer.
Are you Laura Palmer?
Harry, it's Cooper.
Meet me for breakfast, 7 a.m., the hotel lobby.
I know who killed Laura Palmer.
No, it can wait till morning.
﻿1
Diane, 7:15 a.m.
I'll be heading to the sheriff's after breakfast.
From there, we'll be going on to Laura Palmer's funeral.
Good morning, Colonel Cooper.
Just "agent," Audrey. Special agent.
Special agent.
Would you care to join me for breakfast?
I'm in a hurry. For what?
Audrey, that perfume you're wearing is incredible.
Do you really think so? Yes, I do.
Please have a seat.
And would you write your name down for me? Here.
Okay.
There's something you'd like to tell me.
There is?
You slipped this note underneath my door night before last.
I did?
I wanted to help you. For Laura.
You said you and Laura weren't exactly friends.
We weren't friends, but I understood her better than the rest.
What is One-Eyed Jack's? It's a place up north.
Men go there.
What about women?
Women, you know, work there.
Did Laura work there?
I don't know.
Laura worked at my father's department store.
Horne's. He named it after himself.
Where at Horne's Department Store?
At the perfume counter.
So did Ronette Pulaski. Really?
Audrey, that rightward slant in your handwriting
indicates a romantic nature.
A heart that yearns. Be careful.
I do?
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now.
Police business.
Thank you for talking to me.
Trudy, two more coffees, please. Mm.
Harry, Lucy.
It is an absolutely beautiful morning.
Short stack of griddlecakes, melted butter,
maple syrup, lightly heated, slice of ham.
Nothing beats the taste sensation when maple syrup collides with ham.
Griddlecakes, slice of ham.
Who killed Laura Palmer?
Ahh.
Let me tell you about the dream I had last night.
Tibet? No.
You were there. Lucy, so were you.
Harry, my dream is a code waiting to be broken.
Break the code, solve the crime.
"Break the code, solve the crime."
In my dream, Sarah Palmer has a vision of her daughter's killer.
Deputy Hawk sketched his picture.
I got a phone call from a one-armed man named Mike.
The killer's name was Bob.
Mike and Bobby?
No. It's a different Mike and a different Bob.
They lived above a convenience store.
They had a tattoo:
Fire, walk with me.
Mike couldn't stand the killing anymore, so he cut off his arm.
Bob vowed to kill again, so Mike shot him.
Do you know where dreams come from?
Not specifically. No.
Acetylcholine neurons fire high-voltage impulses
into the forebrain.
These impulses become pictures, the pictures become dreams.
But no one knows why we choose these particular pictures.
So, what was the end of this dream?
Suddenly, it was 25 years later.
I was old, sitting in a red room.
There was a midget in a red suit and a beautiful woman.
The little man told me that my favorite gum was coming back into style
and didn't his cousin look exactly like Laura Palmer? Which she did.
What cousin? The beautiful woman.
She's filled with secrets.
Sometimes her arms bend back.
Where she's from, the birds sing a pretty song
and there's always music in the air.
The midget did a dance.
Laura kissed me and she whispered the name of the killer in my ear.
Who was it?
I don't remember.
Damn. Damn.
Harry, our job is simple. Break the code, solve the crime.
Yeah?
Sheriff, I'm at the morgue and there's a big fight going on.
You hang on. I'll be right there.
That was Andy. There's a fight over at the morgue.
Albert.
You're the most cold-blooded man I've ever seen.
I've never met a man with so little regard for human frailty.
Have you no compassion?
I've got compassion running out of my nose, pal.
I'm the sultan of sentiment.
Dr. Hayward, I have traveled thousands of miles
and apparently several centuries to this forgotten sinkhole
in order to perform a series of tests.
I do not ask you to understand these tests.
I'm not a cruel man.
I just ask you to get the hell out of my way
so I can finish. Is that clear?
We are here to conduct Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery.
If you think we're gonna leave here without her, you are out of your mind.
All right, all right, all right.
Mr. Rosenfield, please.
Now, uh, Leland Palmer couldn't be with us today,
but I know I speak for everyone,
the Palmer family included,
when I say that, uh, we appreciate and understand the value of your work.
But as their representative,
I must insist that we consider the feelings
of the Palmer family as well.
Mr. Horne, I realize that your position in this fair community
pretty well guarantees venality, insincerity,
and a rather irritating method of expressing yourself.
Stupidity, however, is not a necessarily inherent trait.
Therefore, please listen closely. You can have a funeral any old time.
You dig a hole, you plant a coffin.
I, however, cannot perform these tests next year,
next month, next week or tomorrow.
I must perform them now.
I've got a lot of cutting and pasting to do,
so why don't you return to your porch rockers and resume whittling?
That does it. I'm taking charge of the body.
You don't touch Laura from this moment on.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Gentlemen. Whoa!
What's going on? Thank God.
Cooper, this old fool is obstructing a criminal investigation. Cuff him.
He won't release Laura's body for the funeral. He's not human.
What's the holdup? Please, Cooper.
I do not suffer fools gladly and fools with badges, never.
I want no interference from this hulking boob. That clear?
I've had just about enough of your insults.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I've had about enough of, uh, morons and half-wits,
dolts, dunces, dullards and dumbbells.
And you, chowderhead yokel, you blithering hayseed,
you've had enough of me?
Yes, I have.
Ugh. Oh, that's nice. How appropriate.
Wait in the car, Harry.
The old rustic sucker punch, huh?
A hail of bullets would be nice. That's enough.
The sheriff didn't mean anything.
He hit me. Well, I'm sure he meant to do that.
Albert, I want you to release this girl's body to her family immediately.
I want your test results by noon. Those are orders.
Thank you, Agent Cooper.
Invitation to Love.
Starring Martin Hadley as Chet,
Selena Swift as Emerald and Jade,
Evan St. Vincent as Jared Lancaster
and Jason Dembo as Montana.
My darling daughter, Jade,
and Emerald,
because of my financial difficulties, I have decided to end it all tonight.
I hope you can find the strength to go on without me.
Your loving father, Jared.
Uncle Leland? Daddy, it's Jade.
Uncle Leland. Please. I know you're in there.
Madeleine?
Jade, what a surprise, I...
Maddy?
Is it you?
Uncle Leland,
I am so sorry.
I'm sure Hank appreciates your unwavering devotion.
Your husband has been a model prisoner,
an inspiration to guard and inmate alike.
He greets the day with a smile
and confounds adversity with a kind word.
Hank's parole hearing is scheduled for tomorrow.
Barring unforeseen circumstance, with your full support before the board,
he could be released shortly thereafter.
Any questions?
No.
Will you help find the job that Hank needs
to effect a successful parole?
Yes. How exactly?
I own the Double R, Mr. Mooney.
Oh.
You're quite a girl, Norma.
I'll bet you get all kinds of Romeos in here, uh, begging for favors.
How do you keep them from your door?
I usually tell them I have a homicidally jealous husband
who's doing three-to-five for manslaughter,
but he expects to be a productive member of society real soon.
Well, now, that should conclude our session for today, Mrs. Jennings.
Look at that.
Ducks on the lake.
So fill me in on Leo Johnson.
Leo's one of those guys you keep on a list and you keep your eye on.
So far, we haven't caught him with his paws in the cookie jar.
Morning, Leo.
Who the hell is he?
This is Special Agent Cooper, FBI.
We'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
So ask.
Leo, is that short for Leonard?
That's a question?
Did you know Laura Palmer? No.
How well did you know her? I said I didn't.
You're lying.
I knew who she was, all right? Everybody did.
Do you have a criminal record, Leo? Nothing. You can look it up.
Illegal U-turn, April 1986.
Drunk and disorderly, November 1987.
September '88, aggravated assault, charges dropped.
I paid my debt to society.
Where were you the night of Laura Palmer's murder?
Around midnight. On the road.
I called my wife, Shelly, around that time from Butte, Montana.
She'll confirm this? She will if you ask her.
Robbie.
This may be a good time for a brief discussion.
You wanna talk about cigarettes? Today?
No, but put it out.
It's a filthy habit, especially for a varsity athlete.
Yeah, I've attended my share of funerals.
Too many.
Any time a man dies in war, he dies too soon.
Laura died too soon as well.
Yeah, she did.
But we have a responsibility to the dead, Robert.
Responsibility is the linchpin of our society.
Each man responsible for his own actions,
each action contributing to the greater good.
What's the good of putting someone in the ground?
Well, it's man's way of achieving closure.
In ceremony begins understanding,
and the will to carry on without those we must leave behind.
Robert, in your life you must learn,
you will learn, to carry on without them.
Great.
Now, I realize you experience an ongoing disinclination
to enter fully into meaningful exchange.
This leads to stalemate
and a desire on my part to force certain wisdom upon you.
This isn't necessarily a bad thing.
Sometimes it's the best course available.
Son, don't be afraid.
We'll all be there together.
Afraid of what?
Well, the funeral.
I'm not afraid of any damn funeral.
Afraid?
I can hardly wait.
Afraid?
I'm gonna turn it upside down!
Everybody ready?
Deputy Hawk.
Agent Cooper, there's no sign of the man with one arm.
Keep trying. He's out there somewhere.
If anyone can find him, Hawk can.
He's a tracker? The best.
Oh.
Okay, Albert, what do you got?
Enough forensic spadework to save your butt
and get mine out of this godforsaken burg.
What do you got?
Okay, first of all, contents of envelope found in Palmer diary, cocaine.
Toxicology results also positive.
Newsflash: the little lady had a habit.
Next, we've got fibers of twine
embedded in her wrists and upper arms.
Two different kinds of twine.
Fibers of twine found in the railroad car.
Matched the sample from her wrist.
The same twine was used to bind the wrists of the Pulaski girl.
Conclusion: she was tied up twice
at different locations on the night of her death.
Once here and once here.
Like this:
Sometimes my arms bend back.
Here we've got traces of pumice found in standing water
outside the railroad car.
Soap, industrial strength.
I found identical particles on the back of Laura's neck.
It's not her home-use brand.
My conclusion,
the killer washed his hands and then leaned in for a kiss.
Like this:
Good Lord.
Uh, distinctive wounds found on Laura's neck and shoulder
appear to be claw marks, bites of some kind.
An animal.
Look, it's trying to think.
Finally, a small plastic fragment from her stomach
partially dissolved by digestive acids.
I'm taking it back for reconstruction,
as the local facilities give new meaning to the word "primitive."
I note with some interest what appears to be the letter J.
Good work, Albert.
A couple more days with the body, who knows what I might have found?
Sheriff, it's time.
Excuse us. We have got a funeral to get to.
Cooper, may I have a word with you alone?
There's one more item. It's a report concerning the assault on my person
which you witnessed.
I think you'll find it's quite accurate. Requires your signature.
Albert, I'm not gonna sign this.
What?
Albert, I hope you can hear me.
I have only been in Twin Peaks a short time,
but in that time, I have seen decency, honor and dignity.
Murder is not a faceless event here.
It is not a statistic to be tallied up at the end of the day.
Laura Palmer's death has affected each and every man, woman and child
because life has meaning here. Every life.
That's a way of living I thought had vanished.
But it hasn't, Albert. It's right here in Twin Peaks.
Sounds like you've been snacking on some of the local mushrooms.
With your behavior towards these good people,
consider yourself lucky I do not file a report of my own
that could bury you in a building so deep you'd never see the sun.
Diane, it's 12:27 p.m.
I'd like you to look into my pension-plan options
regarding outside real-estate investment.
I may look into purchasing property
at what I assume will be a very reasonable price.
Mm. Mm!
Love me?
You bet.
This a new one?
Yes.
Isn't it beautiful?
Oh.
How do I look?
Well, you look fine, Nadine.
Oh, Ed.
Last night was wonderful.
Oh, my darling Ed, you came back to me.
Now I feel like we're really together again.
Ed, in high school,
I used to watch Norma and you at those football games.
She was so pretty.
And you made such a handsome couple.
But I knew,
even though I was just
a little nobody,
just a little brown mouse,
I always knew inside,
once you got to know me,
we'd be together forever.
That's not your bike, is it, Ed?
It's James.
James who?
Oh.
We don't wanna be late. Are you ready?
I'm not going.
It's Laura, James.
I can't.
I just can't.
James.
I don't care what the doctor says.
If you keep indulging him this way, he is never going to change.
I don't think we should be discussing this
while Johnny's in the room.
Johnny doesn't even know what day it is.
We have to be patient. You be patient.
I have been waiting 20 years for some sign of intelligent life.
I'm clear about this, Sylvia. I have my limits.
Don't I know it.
My, let's all spray venom in my general direction.
You take it with no problem.
Taking it is the specialty of the house.
Sylvia, I'm going to make it extremely simple for you.
We can't take Johnny to the funeral in that ridiculous getup.
Let Dr. Jacoby see what he can do.
We gotta go.
No, no.
You do it, then.
Am I going to have to call Dr. Jacoby
every damn time I have a problem with Johnny?
Oh, thank God.
All right, let's everyone just get into the car.
I am the resurrection and the life.
He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
For if we live, we live unto the Lord.
And if we die, we die unto the Lord.
Whether we live, therefore, or we die,
we are the Lord's.
Blessed be the dead who die in the Lord,
even so sayeth the Spirit, for they rest from their labors.
The Lord be with thee.
Let us pray.
O God, entrust this child, Laura, to thy never-failing care and love,
and bring us all to thy heavenly kingdom,
through the same, thy son, Jesus Christ our Lord,
who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit.
One God, now and forever. Amen.
I baptized Laura Palmer.
I instructed her in Sunday school.
And I, like the rest of you, came to love her
with that special love that we reserve for the headstrong and the bold.
Laura was bright.
She was beautiful, she was charming.
But most of all, Laura was, I think, impatient.
She was impatient for her life to begin,
for the world to finally catch up to her dreams and ambitions.
Laura used to say that I talked too much.
I'll not make that mistake today.
Just let it be said that I loved her,
and I will miss her the rest of my days.
Amen.
Amen.
Thank you, Johnny.
Amen!
What are you looking at?
What are you waiting for?
You make me sick.
You damn hypocrites make me sick!
Everybody knew she was in trouble.
But we didn't do anything.
All you good people.
You wanna know who killed Laura?
You did!
We all did.
And pretty words aren't gonna bring her back, man, so save your prayers.
She would've laughed at them anyway.
You are dead, man. You're dead.
That's enough, Bobby. That's enough.
You're dead!
Get off me.
You're a dead man. Dead.
You're dead, man. Gah! Dead.
That's enough. Come on.
Get off me.
Agh!
My baby. Laura.
Laura, no.
Hang on. Can you reach him?
No...
The whole thing has gone haywire.
Don't ruin this too.
My baby.
Laura.
Laura.
So here's the guy, right. He was the father.
And this is his daughter in the coffin. He goes, boom!
I'm telling you, Harry, he's just not gonna figure this out.
Ed, that's a bet I'll take for the check.
He's right on time.
Harry, careful who you trust. He's just not one of us.
Cooper, take a seat.
Harry, I got your note. Hawk, Big Ed.
How would you like some fresh huckleberry pie?
I would love a slice of pie.
Norma, slice of huckleberry pie, heated,
vanilla ice cream on the side, coffee.
Coming right up.
Big Ed, how long you been in love with Norma?
Ed, looks like pie and coffee's on you.
Okay, what did you call me in to talk about
besides the highlights of the dinner menu?
You better tell him.
Somebody's running drugs into Twin Peaks from across the border.
We've been working this for months, trying to set up a bust.
Top to bottom. Nobody walks. Who's targeted?
Jacques Renault, bartender at the Roadhouse.
We figure him for the middleman.
Now, Ed's been doing some undercover.
In fact, the night you got into town, he was staking Renault out.
We think Renault slipped him a mickey.
Felt like somebody hit me with a log splitter.
Ed, I didn't know you were a deputy.
He's not.
Well, it's a little outside your jurisdiction, don't you think?
Somebody's selling drugs to high school kids,
and I figure that's everybody's jurisdiction.
I call Ed in when I need him.
He's not the only one I call.
Thanks, Norma. Enjoy.
Mm.
This must be where pies go when they die.
Okay, Harry, would you please tell me why you really called me in here?
You're gonna have to go along with me on this
even if it sounds a little weird.
I'm with you. Twin Peaks is different.
A long way from the world. You've noticed that.
Yes, I have.
And that's exactly the way we like it.
But there's a back end to that that's kind of different too.
Maybe that's the price we pay for all the good things.
What would that be? There's a sort of evil out there.
Something very, very strange in these old woods.
Call it what you want:
a darkness, a presence.
It takes many forms,
but it's been out there for as long as anyone can remember.
And we've always been here to fight it.
We?
Men before us.
Men before them.
More after we're gone.
A secret society.
Why don't we take Agent Cooper for a little ride?
Where to? The Bookhouse.
This is where we get together.
Going on 20 years now.
"We" meaning?
The Bookhouse Boys.
Coffee's free. Like the sound of that.
Cooper, you know James.
Agent Cooper. James.
This is Joey Paulson. Joey.
Who's this?
Bernard Renault, Jacques' brother.
Janitor at the Roadhouse.
Bernard came across the border this morning
with an ounce of cocaine in his kit bag.
Thought we'd ask him a few questions.
Did you ever sell drugs to Laura Palmer?
I don't sell drugs.
How much does Jacques pay you to be the mule?
Jacques don't pay me nothing. I'm no mule.
So that ounce you had, that was for personal use?
That's right.
Guess you don't get a whole lot of sleep at night, then, huh, Bernie?
Your brother didn't come into work the last few days. Where's he been?
I don't know.
He got personal business.
Who else is he dealing with?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
He be back tonight. Any minute.
He's coming to work at the Roadhouse?
He the bartender, isn't he?
Bernard, we've got you tied up in a chair.
You're mixed up with your brother in a wide variety of felonies.
What I wanna know is, why in the world would you tell us
where and when to find him?
Yeah? Leo.
It's Jacques. What's up?
The light. The bust light's on.
Bernard's in trouble. You sure?
I saw it, man.
You gotta get me out of here, Leo. Border run.
Where are you? Phone booth by the cash and carry.
And I don't like waiting, man.
Shut up. I'm on my way.
Hi.
Where you going? You don't need to know.
Josie.
Josie, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing? Mm.
God, you're beautiful.
Josie, there is something wrong.
What is it? I want you to tell me.
Something horrible is going to happen.
They wanna hurt me. I know it. Who?
Who wants to hurt you?
Catherine.
Catherine and Benjamin Horne.
What makes you think so?
I heard Catherine on the phone saying I'd never suspect.
Just like with Andrew's death.
Andrew's death was an accident.
Was it?
Catherine keeps the mill account books in her safe.
Two books. Different numbers.
Andrew built this years ago.
I don't think Catherine knows that I know it's here.
Why do you think they have two sets of books?
The usual reasons would have something to do with stealing.
Maybe worse.
There were two. I saw them.
You believe me, don't you?
Of course I do.
There's nothing unusual in this one.
Oh, there were two.
I swear, there were two.
Have you seen my tackle box?
The next time you and the merry widow wanna take a peek in my safe,
don't go to so much trouble.
Be a man about it, Pete. Ask me to my face.
Maybe I'll, um, check the truck.
Dr. Jacoby.
I didn't see you at the funeral today.
I'm a terrible person, Agent Cooper.
I pretend that I'm not, but I am.
Oh, I sit and listen to their problems,
day after day.
These people think of me as their friend.
The truth is, I really don't care.
I thought nothing, no one,
could ever reach me again.
Laura changed all that.
I couldn't come today.
I just couldn't.
I hope she understands.
I hope she forgives me.
You think it's possible?
You think somebody killed Andrew?
I don't know.
I believe what they want is to take the mill away from me.
For Benjamin to have the land.
If it was true with Andrew,
you think they'll kill me too?
Think they would?
Josie,
nothing is gonna happen to you.
Not now, not ever. Not while I'm around.
Do you believe in the soul?
Several.
More than one? Blackfoot legend.
Waking souls that give life to the mind and the body.
A dream soul that wanders.
Dream souls.
Where do they wander? Faraway places.
The Land of the Dead.
Is that where Laura is?
Laura's in the ground, Agent Cooper.
That's the only thing I'm sure of.
To Laura.
Godspeed.
Will you dance with me? No.
Sorry, pal. Please.
Dance with me? No.
Please. That's kind of rude, mister.
Dance with me. Come on, leave us alone.
Dance with me, please?
Please.
Somebody dance with me.
Mr. Palmer? Leland.
Let's take you home.
Home.
﻿1
Yeah.
Yeah, his hair was long. Filthy, gray-on-gray, long hair.
I saw him, at the foot of Laura's bed.
He looked like an animal.
Had you ever seen this man before? No, never.
His face. My God, his face.
Sarah, did you tell them about the necklace?
You're gonna love that one. What necklace?
She's had two visions.
Go ahead, Sarah.
Leland.
Sarah.
It's night.
A flashlight beam moves across the ground.
Then a hand,
a gloved hand,
lifts a rock and takes out a necklace.
Broken in half.
It was Laura's.
Invitation to Love.
Don't fight it, Chet.
You know as well as I there's still something between us.
There always will be.
For God's sake, Emerald.
That may be true, but I'm married to your sister now.
It's wrong.
Well, you always said you could never tell us apart, so...
Morning, Lucy. What's going on?
Uh, thanks to Jade, Jared decided not to kill himself.
And he's changed his will, leaving the Towers to Jade instead of Emerald,
but Emerald found out about it, and now she's trying to seduce Chet
to give her the new will so that she can destroy it.
Montana's planning to kill Jared at midnight,
so the Towers will belong to Emerald and Montana,
but I think she's going to double-cross him and he doesn't know it yet.
Poor Chet.
What's going on here?
Uh, Agent Cooper's in the conference room with Dr. Jacoby.
Thank you.
Lucy, why couldn't I spend the night last night?
Will you be having coffee, Deputy Brennan?
Was Laura Palmer seeing you because she was addicted to cocaine?
Agent Cooper, I'd like to help you, but, uh, I got a little problem here.
Look, maybe there's some sort of hula we can do
around my doctor-patient confidentiality, huh?
It is safe to say she came to you because she was having problems?
Oh, my, yes.
Were her problems of a sexual nature?
Agent Cooper,
the problems of our entire society are of a sexual nature.
Tibet. Hm.
You know, my abiding interests lie to the east as well,
but only as far as, uh, Hawaii.
Ancient Hawaiians often turned to the soothing rhizome of the ginger plant
to ease the pain of profound confusion.
Which, more often than not, was sexual.
Ginger is nonaddictive. Cocaine is.
Look, the fact that Laura Palmer sought medication,
no matter how dubious, was actually a positive sign.
Dr. Jacoby, I understand you cared deeply for Laura Palmer.
Why is it that you won't help us?
My own personal investigation, I suspect,
will be ongoing for the rest of my life.
Laura had secrets.
And around those secrets, she built a fortress that...
Well, that in my six months with her I was not able to penetrate,
and for which I consider myself an abject failure.
Doctor, did Laura ever discuss Bobby Briggs
or James Hurley with you?
Yeah, they were boys. Laura was a woman.
She had sex with three men the night she was murdered.
Were you one of them? Heh.
No.
Who killed her, Dr. Jacoby?
The night after Laura died,
I followed a man that, uh, Laura had spoken to me about.
He was driving a red Corvette.
I followed him to the Old Sawmill Road and then I lost him.
And that, gentlemen, is all I can tell you.
Agent Cooper,
there's a Gordon Cole on the phone.
He says you're expecting his call. Should I put him through?
Yes, Lucy, put him through.
Thank you, doctor. That will be all.
You'll be in town, doctor?
Well, I'm planning a pilgrimage to Pebble Beach,
but that's not till the end of the month.
Hang loose, haoles.
Does Leo Johnson drive a red Corvette?
Yes.
How we doing on Jacques Renault? There's an APB on him.
His brother made bail this morning. I got an all-points on him too.
Harry, this is my supervisor.
Good morning, Gordon. How are we doing?
Cooper, where do we start?
The Palmer girl or Albert's new best friend, Harry Truman?
Laura Palmer. Albert has been very busy.
The twine he found on her upper arms is a common household variety.
Finley's Fine Twine.
And the twine on her wrists? Definitely not a match. No ID yet.
And those marks on her shoulders?
Bird bites. Bird bites?
He'll also be faxing a reconstruction
of the plastic fragment from her stomach.
Great, tell Albert we're anxiously awaiting his results.
Now for the bad news, Coop.
I've got an O.O.J. and an A.F.O. here from Albert
concerning his mano a mano with the local Sheriff Truman.
Albert wants this guy's badge, Coop.
Gordon, here's how it is. You know Albert.
In my opinion, Sheriff Truman displayed the patience of a saint
not clocking him a day earlier than he did.
He wants it filed with the U.S. attorney.
File it under F for "forget it." Cooper.
Tell Albert if he wants to pursue this... Coop.
I'll fight him all the way to Washington.
Don't get excited and hang up, now. I'll talk to you later, Gordon.
Thanks. Uh, I didn't get a whole lot of sleep last night.
Harry, the last thing I want you to worry about while I'm here
is some city slicker I brought into your town relieving himself upstream.
This is the man I saw in my dream. You saw this man?
I had an intuition that my dream and Sarah Palmer's vision were connected.
I didn't go with you this morning because I didn't wanna influence her.
I'm a strong sender. The eyes were a bit closer together.
Deputy Hawk calling in for Agent Cooper.
Hawk.
Right. Stay there.
Follow him if he moves.
Traveling east on Highway 12, how long will it take us
to reach the Timber Falls Motel?
Half an hour. Ten minutes.
Depends how you go. Hawk's found our one-armed man.
I wish I could have seen Josie's face.
Opening the safe for her lawman Romeo
to show him the double set of books,
and all she finds is the one I've been slowly cooking.
Where's the book that spells bankruptcy?
Mm, I have more than one hiding place.
Life goes on, trust me.
My desk upstairs.
There's a drop panel in the top drawer.
Not even Pete the poodle knows about that one.
I'm famished.
Let's get one thing straight.
I didn't spend 18 months up the Amazon
dodging blow darts for my health.
I suppose room service is too much to expect of this rusticated mildew farm.
You would prefer the Lumber Baron Suite at the Great Northern?
I'd prefer getting on with setting the torch to that damn mill.
Harry, he's here at the motel. Room 101.
Last name's Gerard.
Now, when the mill goes up in smoke, the headline that we're after is:
"Josie Packard torches bankrupt mill in insurance fraud."
Not "Giant weenie roast in the woods."
Ha-ha-ha-ha. Hm? Hm?
Mr. Gerard, it's the police. Open up.
What...? Jeez...
Gunplay? Sounds serious.
Mr. Gerard.
Don't move. Oh, my God.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
You, uh, let me know if there's any bloodshed.
I'm going to give little Elvis a bath.
What do you mean, you don't know him? You know this man.
Oh, no, sir. I've never seen that man before in my life.
But you know something, he kind of looks like somebody, doesn't he?
Mr. Gerard, do you have a friend named Bob?
Bob Lydecker's just about my best friend in the world.
Why have you been at the hospital the past two days?
Bob's in a coma.
There was a Lydecker assaulted three days ago outside a bar
in Lotown.
That's Bob. Is your friend Bob a doctor?
He's just about the best darn veterinarian in these parts.
Thanks.
He's clean. No record, no warrants.
Take a look at his car.
Your middle name is Michael.
Named after my uncle.
How'd you lose the arm? Car accident.
I was on the road from Memphis to, uh...
Someplace. Selling pharmaceuticals.
Pretty good job.
That's what I'm selling these days. Everybody needs shoes.
They're all for the right foot. That's my sample case.
Yeah. Two-day delivery, guaranteed.
We could certainly take care of all your departmental needs.
The arm you lost, did it have a tattoo?
What's this all about?
I'm a shoe salesman. Settle down, Mr. Gerard.
He just asked you a question.
If you won't tell us, we can find out.
What did it say?
It said "Mom."
Harry.
What do you got?
Car was already staked out when I got here.
It was Josie Packard.
I've been doing some research.
In real life, there is no algebra.
Maybe you should run away and join the circus.
Escape.
I got a better idea.
A tall, dark and handsome stranger falls madly in love with me,
takes me away to a life of mystery and international intrigue.
You mean the FBI agent? Dream on.
Maybe.
Or maybe he'll realize that I'm the woman of his dreams
because I'm gonna help him figure out who killed Laura.
Is that so? Yeah.
And you're gonna help me.
Fact: Laura was seeing James Hurley behind Bobby's back.
What if she was? So it is true.
Fact: Laura had a sweet tooth for nose candy.
Well, I guess that's not such a big secret.
I didn't know Laura half as well as you, and I knew the score.
Laura was wild.
Come on, will you help me?
What else have you figured out, Sherlock?
The morning of the funeral,
Jacoby's talking to my brother Johnny, trying to get him to go to the funeral.
So he tells Johnny that Laura's in a better place now, blah, blah, blah.
And he knows that because Laura was his patient.
Laura was seeing Jacoby?
It gets better. You ever heard of One-Eyed Jack's?
Isn't that that Western with Marlon Brando?
It's a place across the border. They have girls working there.
Are you saying you think Laura was one of them?
I don't know. But if it's true, wouldn't you wanna know about it?
Well, it sure would explain a few things.
You know, I think about it.
I think about Laura being in a place like that and I get all shivery.
But it's like a hot cold,
like when you hold an ice cube on your bare skin for a long time.
Audrey, I'll help you,
but whatever we find out, we have to promise to keep it between ourselves.
Our secret. It's a deal.
And I know exactly where to start.
Did you know Ronette and Laura worked in the same place?
No.
The perfume counter at my father's department store.
I've arranged for you to have a little chat with Hank before the hearing.
He's glad you're here.
I hope I didn't come on too strong yesterday.
I'll be sure to tell him how helpful you've been, Mr. Mooney.
Haven't seen you for a while, Norma.
Been kind of busy.
So, uh, business is good? Yeah.
You gotta back me up in there, Norma, please.
I gotta get out.
It's starting to put the zap on me, bigtime.
I know I have no right to ask and you have no reason to believe me,
but I'll change.
I swear on my life, I have changed.
Give me a chance to prove it to you.
I've replayed it in my mind a million times,
and I just don't have any answers.
A car in perfect condition goes out of control.
A vagrant nobody knows is killed while sleeping by the roadside.
Why? Why did fate deal me this hand?
You are not incarcerated for an act of fate, Mr. Jennings.
I accept that.
But it was fate, maybe in an odd way even luck, that sent me to prison.
Just as much as the car accident. What is your point?
I know I have a lot to make up for.
For the life I destroyed,
and for another life I very nearly destroyed.
Mrs. Jennings, your husband would be facing a difficult reentry.
How would you help him?
I own the Double R Diner in Twin Peaks.
I can give him a job.
The boss is tough but fair.
And you would live together as man and wife?
Well, he is my husband, isn't he?
Well, we have what we need here.
We'll make our decision without the inmate present.
We'll let you know by 5:00 today.
Catch you later.
In my dream, Mike said he and Bob lived above a convenience store.
Cooper, I'd think you'd be afraid to go to sleep at night.
Hey, Hawk.
Andy, could you go into the One Stop and get me some twine?
Okay.
No, that's not Dr. Lydecker.
Does Dr. Lydecker treat birds? Why, yes, of course.
Rhetta, we're ready for you. There are other vets in Twin Peaks.
Yes, but only one has a best friend with one arm.
Harry, in the heat of the investigative pursuit,
the shortest distance between two points is not necessarily a straight line.
Andy, hand me that spool of Finley's Fine Twine.
Ms. Loomer, we're gonna have to confiscate your files.
What?
Harry, as clear as the signs on the turnpike,
the bird that attacked Laura Palmer is a client of this office.
I feel so bad for you.
I was watching you at the funeral and my heart was aching.
I wanted to hold you so much.
That James Hurley.
He was seeing Laura behind my back.
I'm gonna fix him. Fix me first.
When is Leo due back?
Don't worry, bad boy. I can hear his Vette a mile away.
Don't mess around with this, Shelly. Where is he?
He's with his friend, that creepy Jacques.
Jacques who?
That Canuck guy that works at the Roadhouse.
Leo and Jacques? What's the matter?
Gotta think. I gotta think...
Um, well, think later, Bobby.
I have to go back to the diner in a half an hour.
I gotta tell you something.
What? What is it?
I've been onto this for a while. I've been checking it out.
It's pretty bad. Tell me.
Leo and Jacques are running drugs across the border.
Cocaine. And they've been selling them at school.
I knew it. I knew Leo was messed up in something.
I think it's even possible they were giving drugs to Laura.
Bobby, I have to show you something.
This was in Leo's truck two days after Laura was murdered.
You sure this is Leo's?
It has his initials sewn in the collar.
He makes me sew them into everything.
Shelly, this...
This could be the answer to our prayers.
What do you mean?
You don't need to know. I'm gonna take this, okay?
You never saw this.
Say it. "I never saw it."
I never saw it.
Leo's not gonna be a problem for us anymore.
Stay clear of him and keep quiet.
I bought this. You know how to use it?
I thought you could teach me.
Teach me, Bobby.
Fellas, take them right into the conference room.
Lucy, I need you to go through these files
and pull out all the people who own birds.
How will I know they own birds? It'll say so on the cards.
Okay, I'll start going through the files, then.
Agent Cooper, I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened.
My gun just slipped out of my hand.
Andy, have you ever used your weapon in the line of duty?
No, sir, I haven't. I can't explain what happened.
I've been feeling a little high-strung.
Well, it was lack of preparation. We'll take care of that.
Andy, get some ammunition from the lockbox,
meet us downstairs at the pistol range.
Lucy, did you hear what happened? I feel so dumb.
I dropped my gun and it went off.
Are you all right? Oh, yeah, I guess so, but...
I would like to chat, but I am now under orders to examine these files,
so if you'll excuse me, please.
Laura Palmer's murder was vicious and calculated.
There's no telling what we'll encounter bringing a suspect to ground.
After Andy's mishap at the motel, I wanna make absolutely certain
each of us is comfortable and confident with our firearms.
Nice piece.
Actually, it's standard issue. I made a few modifications.
How long has Lucy been upset with Andy?
Body language?
In this case, it was yelling through a megaphone.
Six rounds apiece to start with, Andy. Okay.
Care to tell us about you and Lucy, Andy?
Jeez, you can tell?
Not too many secrets left around here.
She won't speak to me, and I don't know why.
And I don't know why she's doing what she's doing.
I just can't figure her out.
Well, there's no logic at work here, Andy. Let that one go.
In the grand design,
women were drawn from a different set of blueprints.
Amen to that. Amen.
Hawk, Andy.
Rapid fire.
Hawk. Six for six, two kills. High marks.
Andy.
Andy, what we need is practice and lots of it.
One hour, three times a week. Harry, you'll supply the ordnance?
Whatever it takes.
Chin up, Andy.
You ever been married, Cooper? No.
I knew someone once who helped me understand commitment,
the responsibilities and the risks.
Who taught me the pain of a broken heart.
One woman can make you fly like an eagle,
another can give you the strength of a lion.
But only one in the cycle of life can fill your heart with wonder
and the wisdom that you have known a singular joy.
I wrote that for my girlfriend. Local gal?
Diane Shapiro, Ph.D., Brandeis.
Harry, one miss, five hits, three kills. Excellent.
Only four hits?
I put four through the eyes and one through each nostril.
Nice pattern.
Agent Cooper, I'm looking at the files from Dr. Lydecker's.
And for instance, I have here in the A's an Arky,
who's a part poodle, part rottweiler
who lives on Maple and belongs to Mr. Rumple.
Then, for example, I have an Annette, who's an otter
who lives with a family near Elk River.
We wanted the name of birds.
I know, but the files are all organized alphabetically.
Lucy, go through the bird file.
No, no, you don't understand.
They're organized alphabetically in the names of the pet.
We're gonna need some more coffee.
Thanks, Toad. I'll be sure to get this into my retirement fund ASAP.
Shelly, you're gonna scare the customers.
I've got one man too many in my life, and I'm married to him.
Sound familiar? You should have a little talk with Leo.
Leo doesn't talk. He hits.
He was so great at first, you know?
This flashy guy in his hot car.
Then we get married,
and I find out all he was looking for was a maid he didn't have to pay.
I feel so stupid.
Look at us.
Two men apiece,
and we don't know what to do with any of the four of them.
So how did Hank's hearing go?
They're not gonna decide till this afternoon.
Have you told him you're divorcing him for Ed?
When I saw him, I, uh...
He might not even get out this time around.
Guess my plans are a little up in the air.
Yeah, well, I've definitely got plans for Leo.
You know what we're gonna do, Shelly?
Tomorrow you and I are gonna have a day of beauty.
A manicure, a facial, we're gonna have our hair done, the works.
We're gonna be the knockouts of the Double R.
It's my treat.
Yeah? Yeah.
Donna? Hi, James.
Donna! Hold on.
Who the heck ever heard of diet lasagna?
Just a sec, Daddy. I'll be right in, okay?
It's James. Hm.
Hi, we're having this church potluck dinner here tonight.
Well, tell him to get over here. I need help.
SOS. Okay.
Mayday, mayday.
Would you like to come?
I don't think I'd be very good company.
Well, I think we need to talk. Um...
I've found out some things.
Audrey told me some stuff and Mrs. Palmer saw something.
What? Well, if you come over, I can tell you.
I'm gonna get something to eat. Then I'll be over in a little bit.
Okay. Bye.
Hi.
Who are you?
My name's Madeleine Ferguson.
Laura was my cousin. James Hurley.
Laura and I hadn't seen each other much recently.
I live in Missoula.
Did you know Laura well? I thought I did. Heh.
Here you go. I've got your order ready.
Thanks a lot. Mm-hm.
I'm picking up food for my aunt and uncle.
Aunt Sarah can't cook right now, and Uncle Leland's up half the night
listening to old music and crying and stuff.
But if I was cooking for them, they'd be doing even worse. Heh. Heh.
Um, you think I look like Laura? Yes.
We used to come visit Twin Peaks when I was a kid.
It was great. We'd pretend we were sisters.
I wish I'd known her better.
It's so sad.
Well, it was nice to meet you, James Hurley.
Nice to meet you too.
Thanks for calling, Mr. Mooney.
Are you okay?
Hank got his parole.
He's coming home.
What's that?
No, I don't know what you get when you cross a Norwegian and a Swede.
Oh, very good, sir, very good.
I can't tell you how excited we are
about bringing Icelandic investment to the great Northwest.
Would you put my brother back on, please?
Jerry, who the hell is that joker? You're sure that he's the boss?
Just make sure they don't start taking eggnog in to the pilot.
Jer, I've got the jet gassed up and on the runway in Seattle.
Usher these guys through customs, make your connection,
and save me some of whatever it is that they're having. Ha-ha.
Yeah.
Oh, Audrey. I didn't hear you come in.
What is it this time?
Dad, are you ashamed of me?
Audrey, you're, uh...
You're my daughter.
I was thinking about what we talked about the other night
when you were so mad.
It isn't that I'm ashamed of you, Audrey.
It's just that I wish I could depend on you more,
especially during a trying time like this.
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Dad, I wanna change my life.
I've decided I wanna help you with the family business.
I mean, one of these days you'll need someone to take over,
and obviously it's not gonna be Johnny.
Heh-heh. Oh, Audrey, I wish that I could believe you.
Daddy, please.
I saw a friend of mine cut down like a flower that had just begun to bloom.
Life can be so short.
There isn't all the time in the world,
I see that now, and I wanna change my life.
How, exactly?
I don't need to go to college.
You can teach me the business,
and I'm willing to start at the absolute bottom.
All right. We've got some guests arriving.
You go upstairs and start making some beds.
You still don't believe me?
All right. Okay.
Okay. All right, all right.
Where would you start?
Well, I think I should start at the department store.
Cosmetics or something. Just part-time at first, till I graduate.
You're really serious, aren't you?
You have to start to think about the future, Daddy, just like I am.
The future? Our family's future.
Please let me be your daughter again.
Audrey...
Hello, this is Benjamin Horne.
Uh...
I have to take this, sweetheart.
Oh, okay.
Thanks, Daddy.
Thank you, Audrey.
Where have you been?
Meet me down by the river in a half-hour.
And be discreet.
Here's a bird. Louis Armstrong. He's a parakeet.
Put it with the others.
Agent Cooper,
I've got Gordon Cole on the phone.
Cooper here. Coop,
Albert is faxing you his reconstruction of the plastic object
found in Laura Palmer's stomach.
He's also determined the bites and marks on her shoulders were made
by a parrot or a myna bird.
That's it. You're up to date.
Take a look at this. Something with the letter J.
Poker chip.
One-Eyed Jack's.
Waldo!
Harry, Agent Cooper, it's a myna bird named Waldo.
A myna bird owned by Jacques Renault.
I'll get his home address.
Gentlemen, when two separate events occur simultaneously
pertaining to the same object of inquiry,
we must always pay strict attention.
Fellas, let's make a house call.
Nice game.
Jacques, it's Harry Truman. Open the door.
He's headed around the side. Go get him.
Let's get Forensics and seal this room, Harry.
Harry? Yeah, Hawk.
He got away from me. I lost him in the woods.
Harry?
"L.J." Leo Johnson. Leo Johnson and Jacques Renault.
That's our connection.
Hm?
Nice touch, Leo, nice touch.
Bright-red sports car for a secret meeting. Nice.
You don't like it, get somebody else. Oh, no, no.
Hank said that you were gifted. I believed him.
But, Leo, your whole approach, it's misguided.
Major career opportunity staring you in the face,
and all you can think about is car wax and chicken-feed drug transactions.
Hey, I'm out $10,000. Maybe that's peanuts to you, not to me.
You were in business with a couple glue-sniffing squish-heads, Leo.
The Renault brothers? I broke up their act.
This is Bernie.
Jacques is back in Canada. We had a long talk.
He's staying there.
Jacques was the brains in the outfit.
Bernie made bail this morning on possession.
Ahem. And do we know if, uh, the late Bernard gave you up?
I told him if he ever did, I'd kill him.
Oh, and did he?
No, he shouldn't have trusted me, but like I said, Bernie wasn't too bright.
Okay. One last chance, Leo. Don't disappoint me.
The mill? Keep it simple.
Insurance investigator should read arson, block letters, about 6 feet high.
The deal as we discussed?
The rest on delivery.
Three nights, Leo. Green light.
Is that clear enough?
But if Mrs. Palmer knows about the necklace...
How? How could she know? She said she saw it.
She said she had a vision and she saw someone take it.
Donna.
Donna, it's not here.
Somebody must have seen us. Somebody must have followed us here.
How? How could Mrs. Palmer know?
Laura used to say her mother was kind of spooky.
She used to see things. She had these dreams.
Laura did too.
Maybe we should tell somebody. You mean the police?
Well, if it was the killer, then he knows that we know.
James, the police didn't love Laura. Nobody loved her but us.
I keep thinking I'm gonna see her.
I think that, you know, I'm gonna catch a glimpse of her
out of the corner of my eye.
Sometimes it's like I really do see her.
James, listen. We're gonna find out who killed her.
This is about us.
We have to do this for us, not just for her.
James, I wanna be with you.
Hello?
Josie, it's me.
Hi.
We just got a break in the Palmer case. I can't get away.
I miss you. I need to talk to you. I wanna talk to you too.
Josie, were you at the Timber Falls Motel this afternoon?
Eh, I have to go. Um, call me tomorrow?
Goodbye.
Blow the whistle, Josie. It's quitting time.
How did the shift go, Pete?
Oh, cut some wood, made some lumber.
I'm so tired, I could... You could eat a horse?
I made you a turkey sandwich. Oh, that's fantastic, Josie.
Uh, is Catherine asleep? Yeah.
Good, then give me some mayo with that.
Josie, uh, how do you feel about fish?
To eat? No, to catch.
See, the Fishing Association,
their annual do is coming up, and, uh, I'm defending champion.
And this year, well, they're adding a mixed-doubles division,
and I thought, well, if you were interested, uh,
what the heck, uh, would you like to, uh, partner up with me?
Well, Pete, I don't know the first step about fishing.
Oh, Josie, there's enough fishing in me for the both of us.
Well, what do you think? Sure, Pete.
Let's give it the run at the money.
Josie, you're my kind of gal. Here. I'm gonna hit the hay.
Sweet dreams, Pete. Sweet dreams, Josie.
Hello.
Did you get my message?
Yes.
Catch you later.
﻿1
Diane, it is 4:28 a.m.
I have just been woken up by the most God-awful racket,
which you can probably hear over the sound of my voice.
Can you hear that?
Up until this moment, I've experienced nothing at the Great Northern Hotel
but the most pleasant, courteous service imaginable.
However, it just goes to prove the point that once a traveler leaves his home,
he loses almost 100 percent of his ability to control his environment.
Diane, I was wondering if you could overnight express to me
two pair of those Ear-Pillow silicone earplugs
which I used on my last trip to New York.
Naturally, I didn't bring them with me on this trip,
because I didn't feel it would be necessary.
However...
Coffee?
Please.
What's with the choir practice? Heh.
Business junket. From Iceland.
Got in about 3 this morning.
Ohh.
They're on my floor. Lucky you.
It'll take them a day or two to reset their biological clocks.
Heh. Hope the herring holds out. Mm.
How are you?
Well, Audrey, to be perfectly honest, I'm tired and a little on edge.
Oh.
I got a job.
Good for you.
And I thought maybe now I could help you with your case.
Guess where I'm going...
Audrey, you'll have to excuse me this morning.
I'm running late. I only have time for coffee.
Well, maybe I could go with you.
Wednesdays were traditionally a school day when I was your age.
I can't believe you were ever my age.
I've got the pictures to prove it.
How old are you? Eighteen.
We'll see you later, Audrey.
See you later.
Bye.
Ha, ha. I'll see you later, Sons of Olden!
How do you say that?
My brother will love you guys.
Brother Ben, I bring you greetings
from the fertile treeless tundra of Iceland.
We have had complaints from nearly every guest in the hotel.
What are they on, nitrous oxide?
They are insane for the Ghostwood Estates project.
I have had more serious fun in two days with these Nordic animals.
And, Ben, I'm in love.
Her name is Heba. She's a giant snow queen
with a smile like a sunrise on an ice floe.
You could go blind looking at this girl. Look at this.
You see what she gave me? An entire leg of lamb.
Jerry, come on. Is that beautiful?
Come on, look, you crush some garlic, some fresh mint,
that's rotisserie heaven.
Come on, you gotta meet her.
Jerry, just grab some downtime, will you?
We've laid in a gala reception for your fair-haired boys tonight.
All of Twin Peaks' best and brightest.
We're holding it in a phone booth?
And if we still need a kicker
to nail the sale, I'm thinking that maybe they might enjoy
a little road trip up to, uh, you-know-where. Ah?
Jack's. I am honored to know you.
Ben?
Leland, what are you doing here?
Well, I know there's a new investment group arriving today.
If there's anything I can do...
Leland, the best thing that you can do is follow doctor's orders.
Go home. You need your rest.
I just feel...
I just feel I need something to occupy my mind.
Leland, will you take some time off, for God's sakes?
Fly somewhere. Uh, take Sarah.
I'm afraid to go. I'm afraid.
Hawk, we're here
at Jacques Renault's apartment.
Get over here as soon as you can.
Morning. Morning.
What do you got, Harry?
Jacques Renault's a Canadian national.
He worked the lumber fields this side of the border
until he put on a little excess tonnage a couple of seasons ago.
That's when he started bartending at the Roadhouse.
Harry, are there any more doughnuts?
Sure. Andy.
Thank you.
Better wash that down with a cup a joe.
I didn't get too much sleep last night.
Yeah, you do look a little peaked.
There's a large group of insane men staying on my floor.
Jacques Renault turn up?
No one's seen him for two days.
We've canvassed the building and the Roadhouse.
I sent Hawk to roust his brother. I'll get back to you.
But it looks like Bernie's jumped bail. There's no sign.
Morning, Agent Cooper. Morning, doc.
The blood on the shirt you found here is AB negative.
It's not Laura's blood.
So it was Jacques Renault's blood on Leo Johnson's shirt. Hmm.
Hmm.
Oh. Thank you, Andy.
Mm.
What about Leo Johnson? Could you hold this?
The APB went out last night. Nothing yet.
I need you to find out something. Could you give me a leg up here?
Sure.
What's Jacques Renault's blood type?
Alley-oop. Unh.
Jacques Renault's blood is AB negative.
Thanks, doc.
My pleasure.
Holy smoke. Flesh World again.
Yeah.
Harry, remember that ad with the picture of Ronette Pulaski?
We traced that ad.
It came into the magazine in a plain envelope, no name.
Well, the magazine's a clearing-house.
Readers write letters in response to the ads
and mail them in to the magazine.
The magazine forwards them on to the advertisers.
No direct contact.
Ronette received her letters at this post office box.
That's a local ZIP code.
Now, my guess is that this post office box
will be registered under the name of Jacques Renault.
Let's see who was writing to Ronette.
Postmarked Georgia.
Good night.
I don't know.
The beard sort of ruins the effect of the lingerie.
What do you think?
The guy's no Georgia peach.
Poor bastard.
By the way, Harry, did you notice
the picture of Leo Johnson's truck on that page?
I love it when you cook for me.
Leo hates my cooking.
Leo missed the boat with you, baby.
The biggest mistake of your life
was dropping out of the 11th grade and marrying that road hog.
What would you do if he walked in right now?
Come here.
Hey, Leo. How's it going, man?
What a surprise.
Now, Leo, Shelly tells me that you don't like her cooking.
Tell you what, she and I, we're gonna sit here
while you cook breakfast for us, you hump.
And if you so much as utter one harsh syllable
to this beautiful girl,
I'm gonna shoot your ugly face off, okay, man?
Sheriff's deputy.
Now, Shelly, you do exactly what we said,
and everything's gonna be fine.
Okay? Come here. Mm.
Oh, hi, Andy. Come on in.
Hi, Shelly.
Do you know when Leo might be back?
Is he in some kind of trouble?
No, we just wanna talk to him.
This wouldn't be about Laura, would it?
Why do you say that?
Well, I heard him talking to this guy, Jacques, the night he left.
Jacques Renault?
Yeah. They were outside arguing.
I couldn't hear exactly, but they did seem to be arguing about her,
and then they drove off together.
Shelly, you call us the minute he gets in touch with you.
Okay, I will. Thanks for stopping by.
How'd I do? You did great. Oh.
You drive me crazy.
Hello? Hi.
Hi, Leo. Where you calling from?
Has anybody come by?
What's that? Is anybody looking for you?
Why would anybody be looking for you?
Are you sure?
You know how paranoid you get
when you've been popping bennies on the road a couple of days.
So when are you coming home?
Soon. Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine, Leo.
Come on home.
I miss you, Shelly.
I miss you too.
Hey, good-looking.
Hope you don't mind my coming.
Oh, no.
Nadine won't be back from that patent attorney
over there in Fairvale for a couple of hours.
Ah. The famous silent drape runners.
She's already spending the millions.
Well, I have to put gas in my car like everyone else, right?
You bet.
I didn't wanna tell you on the phone, but Hank got his parole.
Okay.
He'll be coming home. I mean, back.
I only saw him a minute before the hearing.
He seemed so hopeful.
I didn't wanna say anything.
You don't have to explain.
Have you said anything to Nadine yet?
Haven't yet.
Waiting for me to go first?
No.
It's just that, uh, Nadine's not well.
What are you saying?
I don't know.
I think I do.
I don't ever wanna hurt you, babe.
Maybe that's our trouble, Ed.
We never wanna hurt anyone.
We never just take what we want.
There's a part of me that's beginning to think
that this is how it is when you get to the end of your life
and that you don't have anything to show for it.
Norma.
Don't call me. I mean, not for a while, okay?
Okay.
I love you, Ed.
I can remember when you were just a little girl.
So did my father speak to you?
Yes, yes, he did.
And I can't tell you how excited we are to have you come on board
and put in a hitch with us down here at our flagship.
So, what did you have in mind for me?
Well, Audrey, as per your father's suggestion,
starting low, aiming high, et cetera,
we thought perhaps the Wrapping Department,
gifts, et cetera. Part-time, after school.
No, no, no.
Emory, may I speak frankly?
Oh, please do.
Let's talk retail.
Sales?
Perfume.
One of our more, uh, sensitive areas.
Expensive items, delicate customer relations.
I'm afraid I've got my heart set on it, Emory.
Heh. I'd have to talk to your father.
Emory, here's what we're gonna do.
You're gonna tell my father
that I'm busy as a bee wrapping boxes with the drones.
Then you're gonna put me to work this afternoon
behind the perfume counter,
because if you don't, I'm gonna rip my dress in half
and scream at the top of my lungs
and tell my father that you made a pass at me.
Does that help to clear things up for you?
Yes.
Yes, what?
Yes, Miss Horne.
Shall we get started on the paperwork?
James. I got your note.
Are you all right?
Donna, there's some things I gotta say.
I told you that my dad died when I was 10.
He didn't die.
He was a musician. We were living on the West Coast.
He was a bum, and he ran off on me and my mom.
I'm sorry.
My mom was a writer.
She was really good. Poems and short stories.
She's an alcoholic.
If you have a problem with this, I know you didn't ask to hear it.
I don't have a problem. You tell me.
It's true she was out of town this week, but she wasn't traveling.
What she does is she goes to another town,
shacks up in some cheap hotel with a couple of bottles
and picks up guys and...
It's all right.
I'm telling you this because I don't wanna have any secrets from you.
I don't want there to be any lies between us.
It's the secrets people keep
that destroy any chance they have of happiness,
and I don't want us to be like that.
We won't. We won't be.
We have to do what's right.
What you said yesterday was true.
If we don't do everything we can to figure out what happened to Laura,
it'll never go away our whole lives.
We will, James.
She's out there, wandering like a restless spirit.
I feel it too.
We owe it to her.
At least they're fresh. Here you go, Gary.
Oh, thanks.
Here you go, Scott. Thank you.
There you are.
What do you wanna mark this?
Mark it duplicate. Do we have one like it?
Yeah, the same stain. We had it before.
Mark it duplicate.
Hmm. Red drapes.
That PO Box was registered to Jacques Renault.
Those are the letters responding to Ronette's ad in the magazine.
Let's see if there's something from someone we know.
Hawk, hand me that magazine, would you?
What is it?
Two different ad numbers mailed to the same post office address.
Ronette's and one other.
Yeah, here it is.
"Young student requires education in the ways of love.
Only generous mature men need apply."
It's Laura.
You see some identifying mark?
The drapes. Drapes?
Red drapes, Harry, from my dream.
Now, why would an apartment dweller like Jacques
buy 50 gallons of heating oil?
Yeah, yeah, I already got it.
To heat a log cabin.
Harry, you're all right.
Jacques' brother said something about a place up near the state line.
Fellas, let's pack a lunch. We're taking a walk in the woods.
Madeleine.
Hi. Hi.
Hi. I'm Madeleine Ferguson.
My friends call me Maddy.
This is really nice of you guys.
I don't really know anybody in town except Aunt Sarah and Uncle Leland.
And the mood at the house, you can probably guess,
isn't that great right now.
Would you like something to drink?
A cherry Coke would be great.
You got it.
Madeleine.
If I said that you can't really say a word of this to anyone, not a soul,
not even your aunt or uncle, would that be okay with you?
It sounds like some big secret.
It is.
James and I knew Laura better than anyone did.
She was in some kind of terrible trouble before she died,
worse than any of us could imagine.
What?
Well, I'd rather not say too much about things we can't prove yet.
You said you can't prove it yet.
We loved Laura.
We're afraid that the truth might never come out
or that the person who killed her might never be caught.
We've sworn on her memory not to let that happen.
My God. You know who did it?
We have some ideas.
We wanted to talk to you about this because we need your help.
What do you want me to do?
Laura used to talk about a secret hiding place she had
somewhere in her house, maybe in her room.
I'm not really sure. But nobody else knew about it.
We think she might have left something there
that could lead us to the killer.
I'll help you.
You will?
The day before she died,
I had a feeling that Laura was in trouble.
I've always felt close to her. That's why I came here.
You know, I didn't really know Laura that well,
but I feel like I do.
Our folks were always telling us how much alike we were.
Will you call me if there's anything I can do?
I don't think there'll be any problem.
This is really great.
Call me Maddy.
Hi. Hi, Norma.
We look like a couple of refugee beauty queens.
You don't know how really good-looking you are.
I never felt so glamorous.
Hope I don't chip a nail slinging plates around.
Hi, Norma.
Hello, Hank.
Surprised to see me, huh?
Yes.
Is that Leo's girlfriend?
Wife.
That Leo. So impulsive.
Not much meat on her, though.
Hey, I don't expect a kiss or anything.
I figure I gotta earn my way back into your heart.
But, Norma, I intend to try.
So where do I start?
Washing dishes will be fine.
Can I finish my coffee first, boss?
Oh, no. Oh, no. No.
You little Froot Loop.
You're done! Done!
Don't ever cross me.
Tune in tomorrow for Invitation to Love.
He's been spending more and more of his time alone in his room.
It's become much more difficult to engage him in conversation.
Terrible mood swings.
We've been told by the school that his attendance has become erratic at best.
And then there's the matter of public fighting,
both at the Roadhouse and at the funeral.
Are you using drugs, Bobby?
Nope.
Alcohol. Alcohol's a drug.
Well, that's not what he meant. Alcohol doesn't count?
Everybody drinks.
Are you unhappy, Bobby?
Shouldn't I be?
Well, that's not for me to say.
Have you ever killed anybody?
Have you? My father has.
During wartime. That's different.
Different from what?
Perhaps I should spend a few minutes with Bobby alone.
This is supposed to be family counseling.
Well, and I'll need to spend some time with each member of the family alone,
but Bobby first.
Fair enough. Whatever you say.
Bobby, let's just cut the crap, huh?
Okay, so your parents don't understand
what you're going through right now.
Heh. That's a good one.
Let's talk about Laura.
Okay. Let's talk about Laura.
Bobby, what happened the first time
that you and Laura made love?
What the hell kind of question is that?
Bobby, did you cry?
Did I what?
And then what did Laura do? Did she laugh at you?
Were you very sad when Laura died?
Laura wanted to die. How do you know that?
Because she told me.
What else did she tell you?
Did she tell you there was no goodness in the world?
She said people tried to be good,
but they were really sick and rotten, her most of all.
And every time she tried to make the world a better place,
something terrible came up inside her
and pulled her back down into hell.
It took her deeper and deeper into the blackest nightmare.
And every time, it got harder to go back up to the light.
Did you sometimes have the feeling
that Laura was harboring some awful secret?
Yeah.
Bad enough that she wanted to die because of it?
Yes.
Bad enough that it drove her to consciously try to find
people's weaknesses and prey on them,
tempt them, break them down,
make them do terrible, degrading things?
Yes. Laura wanted to corrupt people.
Because that's how she felt about herself.
Yes.
Is that what happened to you, Bobby?
Is that what Laura did to you?
She wanted so much.
She made me sell drugs so she could have them.
This way. Through here.
Watch your step there, city boy.
Thanks, Harry.
What is it, Hawk?
Is that the cabin we're looking for?
Maybe, maybe not.
You might wanna hang back a step, doc.
Huh. Might want to, anyway.
About time you got here.
They move so slowly when they're not afraid.
Come on, then. My log does not judge.
I've got tea.
I've got cookies. No cake.
Well, that's very kind of you, ma'am, but I don't believe that...
What kind of cookies?
Sugar.
The owls won't see us in here.
A cup of tea would be very nice.
Shut your eyes and you'll burst into flames.
Thanks, Margaret.
We'll let it steep.
Wait for the tea. The fish aren't running.
You've been expecting us, Margaret?
You're two days late.
But that's your concern.
My log saw something.
Something significant.
What did your log see?
Tea first. Then be ready.
Thank you.
My husband was a logging man. Oh?
He met the devil.
Fire is the devil hiding like a coward in the smoke.
It was the day after the wedding, wasn't it, Margaret?
The wood holds many spirits, doesn't it, Margaret?
You can ask it now.
What did you see that night?
The night Laura Palmer was killed?
Shh.
I'll do the talking.
Dark.
Laughing.
The owls were flying.
Many things were blocked.
Laughing. Two men.
Two girls.
Flashlights pass by in the woods over the ridge.
The owls were near.
The dark was pressing in on her.
Quiet then.
Later, footsteps.
One man passed by.
Screams far away.
Terrible. Terrible.
One voice.
Man or girl? Girl.
Further up. Over the ridge.
The owls were silent.
The two girls were Laura and Ronette.
The two men, Jacques, maybe Leo.
Maybe.
Who's the third man?
Do you hear it?
This way.
And there's always music in the air.
Waldo.
There's film in here.
Blood.
One-Eyed Jack's.
Evening, Mr. and Mrs. Showel.
Okay. Go right ahead. Thank you.
Good evening.
Catherine Martell and spouse. Mm-hm.
Go easy on the sauce tonight, okay, Cathy?
Couple of belts and even you might start to look good to me.
Of course, the modern age has changed forever
the way your people live, Mr. Thorson.
But it would be my guess that there still remains
a tremendous vestigial interest
in the legends and folklore of ancient Iceland.
Vestigial. Absolutely.
Heba, did you know that was an American figure of speech?
No, Jerry. Ha, ha.
Heba, Heba. You never heard that before?
No, Jerry. Ha-ha-ha.
Do you realize the incredible potential that could result
from our taking a mutual dip in each other's respective gene pools?
Heba, I wanna cook for you.
Very, very good. That's funny.
So he says, "What do you get when you cross a Norwegian with a Swede?
A socialist who wants to be king."
Well, I can remember it was, I think, oh, somewhere in the '50s,
I came through your country. Beautiful, beautiful.
Not many trees, though, you know, but...
Hmm.
Would you excuse me?
Of course.
Meet me in my office. Give me two minutes to break away.
Hell hath no fury. What?
Two minutes.
Ah, Thor, I've been meaning to ask you,
are you familiar with the word luhamsta?
Catherine, we agreed, no scenes in front of the guests.
Let's keep the melodrama to a minimum.
The next thing I know, you're polishing my shoes with Dom Pérignon.
Fill me in. What's eating you?
Why did you have this thousand-dollar poker chip
from you-know-where in your pants yesterday?
I thought you preferred women with certain experience.
Hmm.
Jerry gave me that.
It's a good-luck charm.
I thought I'd lost it. I'm so relieved that you found it.
Are you quite finished?
Yes.
In that case...
Oh. Let's burn the mill.
Let's do it tonight.
No, my love.
We'll give Josie one last chance to sell.
Tomorrow.
Failing that, I have retained the services
of a qualified professional.
Breath mint?
Now, let me get this straight.
Your entire country is above the timberline?
Folks, ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?
Can I have your attention?
Heh. First off, I wanna thank you all for turning out
to welcome our neighbors from the magical isle of Iceland.
We are all Icelanders.
The Ghostwood Estates project
is an important part of our future here in Twin Peaks,
and there's no one we'd rather have as partners in our future than...
What...?
Dance with him.
It is serious. Dance with him.
All right.
Jerry, what's going on?
Get Jacoby, get a net, but get him out of my life.
What are they doing?
Jerry. Jerry.
Gather round.
Donna? It's Maddy.
I was looking in Laura's room and I remembered
when we were younger, she used to hide cigarettes in her bedpost.
The top of one of the posts screws off.
I found a tape in her hiding place.
Leland? Where did you go?
I'll meet you and James tomorrow.
Okay. And bring a tape recorder. Leland?
Did anyone see you come in here?
No.
You do realize the risk if anyone sees us.
This was hidden in her desk where you said it would be.
Then we can proceed. When?
Tomorrow night.
Over here. Told you to mind the store, Leo, not open your own franchise.
Hank, I... Do as you're told, Leo.
Next time, you'll watch me take your little chippy apart before I kill you.
Get me a beer, Shelly.
Honey, what happened? Are you okay?
Just get me a damn beer! Aah!
Get up and...
What the hell are you doing with that?
You're not gonna hurt me again.
Don't touch me. Don't come near me, Leo.
You stupid little slut.
You haven't got the guts.
Reach over and turn on the light.
Don't make me leave.
Please, don't make me leave.
﻿1
Audrey, you're a high-school girl.
I'm an agent of the FBI.
So do you want me to leave or what?
What I want and what I need are two different things, Audrey.
When a man joins the bureau,
he takes an oath to uphold certain values.
Values that he's sworn to live by.
This is wrong, Audrey. We both know it.
But don't you like me?
I like you very much.
You're beautiful, intelligent, desirable.
You're everything that a man wants in his life.
But what you need right now, more than anything else, is a friend.
Someone who will listen.
Friends, huh?
Now, I'm gonna go down and get us two malts and some fries downstairs.
Then I want you to tell me all your troubles.
I could take all night.
The night is young.
Now, I'm gonna get the food, and you're gonna get dressed.
I can't tell you all my secrets.
Secrets are dangerous things, Audrey.
Do you have any? No.
Laura had a lot of secrets.
Finding those out is my job.
Good morning, Officer Brennan.
I sure wish you would stop calling me Officer Brennan.
Officer Andy, this is peak-activity time at the station switchboard.
So it's really not convenient for me to talk right now.
Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station, may I help you?
One moment, please.
Dr. Stanicek?
Yes, it's me.
Good. I've got the tests...
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Well, thank you, doctor.
No, I'm fine.
Bye.
Morning, Lucy. Heard you were out sick yesterday.
I'm much better today, thanks.
We're on it. I found it, yeah.
"Gracula Religiosa,
commonly known as the hill myna.
Native to Southeast Asia, Indonesia.
Feeds on fruit mainly, some invertebrates.
Its ability to mimic the human voice is amazing."
Yeah, well, so far, we haven't heard a peep.
Hey, Waldo, what's up?
Well, it says here that "mimicry is a kind of play with the myna."
But this one's in a weakened condition. Starved, dehydrated.
I'd say he's feeling anything but playful.
Here you go, little fella.
Oh, you wanna feed him, Agent Cooper?
I don't like birds.
When do you think he'll start talking again?
Well, according to the book, his urge to mimic should return
with his good health.
Well, if it does, then we've got a witness.
Well, we better keep feeding him.
You got any apples?
Yeah, there's some in the bottom of the fridge.
These grapes are right on the edge.
These just came in from your office.
Ah, forensics confirm Mr. Jacques Renault
had three guests to his cabin.
Laura Palmer, Ronette Pulaski and Leo Johnson.
That was the only exposed negative on that roll of film, Harry.
Look familiar?
That's our Waldo.
No, Harry, the girl. That's Laura.
Well, now we know who and when.
We don't know why.
Voice activated, Harry.
When the bird talks, maybe we'll get some answers.
Albert confirmed that this matches the fragment
found in Laura's stomach.
Thousand-dollar chip from One-Eyed Jack's.
Jacques Renault's working there. He's dealing in the casino.
Well, I think a little fieldwork is in order.
Jack's is over the border, little out of our jurisdiction.
Well, I know that, Harry.
That's why I was thinking this would be a good job for the Bookhouse Boys.
Better call Hawk on that one.
Shelly.
Bobby Briggs.
Come on, lover boy. Leo's waiting.
I called you, but your dad answered. I didn't know what to say.
Bobby's here, baby. Bobby's here.
I shot him, Bobby.
I know I did.
He just screamed and screamed. He sounded like an animal.
You what?
Oh, slow down, Shelly. Talk to me.
He's out there, I know he is.
He's gonna kill me.
Bobby, he's gonna kill me. Shelly, Shelly.
Start over. Go real slow.
Leo came home late last night.
He was all beaten up. He had blood all over him.
I told him I was never ever gonna let him hurt me again.
But he came at me, so I pulled the trigger.
I shot him, Bobby.
What am I gonna do? Where am I gonna hide?
Shelly, Leo Johnson is history, understand?
I'm taking care of you from now on.
I'm gonna deal with Leo. I'm gonna deal with James.
Bobby's gonna deal with everything.
Birdseed? No, this bird eats fruit.
The sheriff says it's a witness.
No, not just because it saw something, because it talks.
And it needs to eat...
What's up, doc? Heh.
Just a few words before I go to sleep.
I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.
Big bad ones, you know?
The kind you like.
It's easier talking into the recorder.
I guess I feel I can say anything.
All my secrets.
The naked ones.
I know you like those, doc.
I know you like me too.
That will be my little secret, okay?
Just like your coconut.
Why is it so easy to make men like me?
And I don't even have to try very hard.
Or maybe, if it was harder...
This one's empty.
"February 23rd." The night Laura died.
Tape's not in there. He must still have it.
I mean, she died. He never returned it.
God, do you think Dr. Jacoby killed her?
We're gonna find that tape tonight.
Where?
Jacoby's office.
What if he's there?
We'll get him out.
How?
Maybe he gets a phone call from Laura.
What's up, doc?
Just a few words before I go to sleep.
I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.
Here, try this. It smells like a florist.
This won't do. I want something more fruity.
Fruity.
As in fruit. Jenny.
Could I see you in my office in five minutes?
Sure. Yeah.
I'm not making myself clear.
I want a scent that makes a statement.
Maybe you should try hanging it around your neck.
It's a perfume, it's a fashion accessory.
Two statements for the price of one.
I don't appreciate your attitude.
Well, thank you for shopping Horne's Department Store.
I'm gonna use the little girls' room.
Okay.
You know, there's a real bad accident outside.
It sounded like a bus or something.
Come right this way, Jenny.
Something really special to talk about today.
Come right in. My, my, you look lovely.
Sit, sit.
Thank you, Mr. Battis.
This is for you, Jenny.
A reward for a job well done.
It's a unicorn, ancient symbol of purity.
Tamed only by the young at heart.
Wow, a unicorn.
Jenny, you had a good time at the club last week, didn't you?
Yeah, yeah, I had a great time, Mr. Battis.
They were very pleased with you as well, I must say.
They'd like you to continue.
And believe me, Jenny, not many girls qualify.
Really? Yes.
Now, the variety of work is completely up to you.
Hostess, cocktail waitress.
Or if you are chosen, hospitality girl.
What's that?
Hospitality girls escort important guests, VIPs.
It's a lucrative opportunity, Jenny.
Attending to wealthy men in need of a little company.
That sounds cool, as long as they're wealthy.
Jenny, your attitude will take you far in this life.
Call this number, ask for Black Rose.
Now why don't we make a trip to Eveningwear
and find you something elegant?
Elegant sounds great, Mr. Battis.
Elegant.
How do you feel about rose?
"Ronette Pulaski."
You're in prison, you remember faces from home.
They all seem like friends somehow, even the ones you barely knew.
It's like something to hang on to, I guess.
Must have been hard on you.
I paid my debt. That's what counts.
You know, you're a really big help around here.
I wanna thank you for that, for getting Norma through.
You're welcome, Hank. It's no problem.
She told me in her letters how much you've meant,
and how much Pete helped...
Pete?
Yeah, no, not Pete. Um...
Oh, no, you mean Ed.
Yeah, Big Ed. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm a little better at faces
than names, I guess. Oh.
Yeah, Big Ed.
Hello there.
Shelly, can we have another cup here?
Hello, Hank.
Hi, Harry. Glad to see me?
You, uh... You looking for a free lunch,
I recommend the meatloaf.
Well, save it. I'm looking for you.
Harry, I'm innocent. What you are is on parole, Hank.
That means you pay your case officer a visit once a week, Fridays.
You miss a visit, go to jail. Got it?
Thanks for the reminder, sheriff.
Stop in anytime.
Do you think people really change, Cooper?
I don't.
Oh, afternoon, guys.
You like some coffee? Afternoon, Shelly. Yes.
We should be on our way.
Harry, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
Every day, once a day, give yourself a present.
Don't plan it, don't wait for it, just let it happen.
It could be a new shirt at the men's store,
a catnap in your office chair,
or two cups of good hot black coffee, like this.
A present. Like Christmas?
Yeah.
Oh. Man, that hits the spot.
Nothing like a great cup of black coffee.
Bye, Audrey.
So did Battis get you a dress?
Yeah, he did.
Got mine yesterday. I'm gonna be working hostess this weekend.
Oh, really? Yeah.
Cool. Got one of these too.
Yeah, what am I gonna do with a horned horse?
Ha, ha. Ditto. I bet he's got cartons of them.
He probably does.
God, Jenny, I did a really dumb thing.
Um, I lost that number that he gave me for Black Rose.
Do you have it?
Yeah, I got it.
Great.
Here.
Thanks.
Okay, I'll talk to you later. Okay, see you tomorrow.
I wasn't fooling, Montana.
You show them, Chet.
You show all of them.
Tune in tomorrow for Invitation To Love.
Ed.
I'm eating bonbons.
Come on, honey, it's not that bad.
You don't know how bad it is.
You don't know all the things I was gonna do for us.
I know.
A new TV, I was gonna do that.
I already looked at a motorboat.
Sweetheart.
It wasn't just things I was gonna buy.
It was a new life we were gonna lead.
Nadine, there's plenty of patent attorneys.
We just got to keep on looking till we find one
that understands drape runners.
Rejected.
Rejected. That's what he said.
Nobody else is gonna say anything different.
Nadine, don't you give up. Don't you dare.
I just got that baby back from Tim and Tom's Taxidermy.
When I caught him, he was this big.
But I guess by the time they take the innards out and put the stuffing in,
it loses something in the translation.
Yeah, well, Pete, it's still a fine-looking trophy,
no matter what the size.
Yeah, well, size isn't everything, I guess.
Harry. I didn't expect you to be here.
I'm late for the mill, but I'll make time for us.
What's wrong?
What were you doing at the Timber Falls Motel, Tuesday?
Oh.
Tuesday I was at the mill.
Hawk saw you. I know you were there.
Oh.
Harry.
You can tell me anything.
Josie, you can tell me anything.
I was there
because Ben and Catherine were there together.
I followed them and I took pictures.
What's this all about?
You asked me for proof last time.
And I followed them and I took pictures.
The other night I heard Catherine talking on the phone.
Something about an accident.
A fire. A fire at the mill.
A fire at Andrew's mill.
My mill.
I'm not gonna let this happen. No.
Neither will I.
I won't let it happen.
Well, now.
Evening, Harry, Ed. You all set?
Is that what you're wearing? It's pretty spiffy, Cooper.
Do you like to gamble, Ed?
Well, I went to Reno once. But I never felt too lucky.
Well, you're gonna be lucky tonight.
It's $10,000 of the bureau's money.
When I gamble with a company stake,
I always like to bring back a 10 to 15 percent return.
How much you wanna start with?
How about 300?
And, Ed, the suit is perfect.
Well, Harry would like to talk with you.
So why don't I see you outside?
Yeah, Harry, what's on your mind?
I'm worried about Josie. She's been real afraid.
About what?
Ben Horne and Catherine Martell.
Now, they've been seeing each other on the side.
It's been going on for years. Josie just found out.
She thinks that they're planning to burn down the sawmill
and somehow get rid of her too.
Do you believe her?
I know Ben Horne wants that land for the Ghostwood Development,
and I know Josie won't sell. Yeah, yeah, I believe her.
How much do you know about her?
Where she's from? Who she was before?
What you getting at? The truth, Harry.
That's my job. I know all I need to know.
I love her, and she's in trouble.
That's good enough for me. Let's look into it.
Thanks.
Is Hawk ready? Yeah, he's outside in the van.
Oh.
I got that brand-new Cadillac you wanted.
Good. It's perfect for our cover.
High rollers from the Tri-Cities.
Oral surgeons, Harry.
Big spenders vacationing among the firs.
Yeah, has Agent Cooper returned yet?
I need to leave another message. Tell him that Audrey called again.
Yes, it's still urgent.
I'm glad you agreed to see me, Mrs. Martell.
It's quite all right.
Normally, I'd never think to impose this late.
That's fine. Now what's this about?
Every agent is instructed five signatures.
It's really the first thing we learn, and somehow we missed one.
Now, refresh my memory. What policy is this?
Your new life insurance.
Since the binder takes effect at midnight tonight,
I really had no choice, see. Just couldn't wait until tomorrow.
Right here, please.
Is everything in order, Mrs. Martell?
Yes. It's just...
This was handled without our actually meeting each other.
And I... I'd almost forgotten.
To be perfectly honest with you, Mrs. Martell,
I withheld that last page myself.
Did you?
Have to admit I thought it a little unusual.
Life insurance and the client is too busy to be involved?
I mean, you did know about this policy, didn't you?
Are you suggesting
that there's something irregular at work here?
I certainly never got that idea from Mrs. Packard, no.
Or from Mr. Horne, for that matter, either.
When he offered to collect your signatures, I thought it was fine.
Just, with a new account I like to be certain to cross every T.
Right here, please.
You know, I'm noticing that there are some minor changes
that I asked my attorney to make that are not included in this draft.
I think what I'd like to do
is go over this with him on the phone in the morning
and initial the changes
and get the completed documents to you at that time.
If there's anything that I can do to help you with the policy
or anything at all, anything.
Are you an ambitious man, Mr. Neff?
One likes to think so.
One never knows.
There may be a few T's left to cross.
Good night.
Mrs. Martell.
I'll see myself out.
Think.
Ed, why don't you open that up?
Wow, look at all this.
Ow.
I'm sorry.
There's a curly-haired wig in there, Ed. It's gonna work like gangbusters.
And I'll help you out with one of those mustaches.
Do you think it will fit? I got a big head.
Okay, give it a try.
Testing, one, two.
Laura, Laura.
What happened? Somebody shot Waldo.
Aw, Jesus.
Poor Waldo.
What happened?
Somebody shot Waldo.
Birdy, birdy, birdy.
Want some orange? Come on. Let's share.
Hello, Waldo.
Laura, Laura.
Don't go there.
Hurting me. Hurting me.
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it.
Leo, no. Leo, no.
Casino's probably in the back.
If Jacques' dealing, that's where we'll find him.
Well, I'll give you the high sign and clear out.
Here comes something.
Evening, fellas. They call me Blackie.
Glad to know you, Blackie. I like your style.
Most do. First time here?
Yeah, it's our rookie season.
Well, you just think of tonight as spring training.
With a little luck, you just might make the team.
You look like a cop. I'm the cop.
You look like Cary Grant. Got a name?
Barney and Fred. Just in from the Tri-Cities.
Well, Fred, what's your line?
Own a gas station.
Um, I'm an oral surgeon.
Well, I got a Chevy parked out back with a serious root-canal problem.
Want to take a look?
Well, I was hoping you might need a little gum work,
because I'd sure like to get a look under your hood.
Mm, Fred's okay.
Fred's a prince.
So, boys, what's your pleasure?
Cards and dice. For starters.
Casino's that way.
This might just be your lucky night. Luck has nothing to do with it.
Not bad, Ed. Not bad at all.
Hawk, we have a small casino room
with the usual games of chance.
Bar's at the far end and there's stairs to who knows where.
Everybody's having a good time.
No sign of Jacques Renault.
Ed's gonna head over to the craps table.
I'm gonna play some blackjack.
Ed,
let's gamble.
You simply have got to teach me some of these incredible songs.
Incredible, eh?
Incredible.
Jerry, maybe you'd like to take some of our guests
down to the dining room.
I'll be with you in a half a tick.
You should have seen them at this tour of the site.
The trees, Ben. Jerry.
They worship them. Jerry.
I caught a couple of them hugging pine.
Jerry. No kidding.
When are they signing the contracts?
This needs more pecan. They're ready, Ben.
They're poised with their pen in their hand.
Mm-hm.
Yeah?
So, what's the catch? More fun.
Signing party.
They want to finalize the deal at One-Eyed Jack's.
How did they find out about Jack's?
I take full responsibility.
Uh-huh. Jerry, Jerry.
Get them back on the van.
Heh. Okay, everybody, back in the van!
Road trip! Road trip!
Hey, going on a road trip. Road trip.
Road trip. Road trip.
Road trip.
Ahem. Hello.
Is she there?
I just came back. She's gone.
We need her at the mill.
I'll get her there.
Is it set for tonight? Yes.
You shouldn't call here for a while.
I know the drill.
You're not a shy one, are you, sweetheart?
I'm not shy.
Hester Prynne.
Pretty name.
Maple House in Vancouver.
Roy's in Chicago.
Calgary Stampede, '87 through '89.
Where did you work in Calgary, darling?
Around.
Can you give me a name?
The Lost Dude Ranch.
Big Amos still running things out there?
Mm. Bigger and better.
Big Amos is the name of my dog.
I read The Scarlet Letter in high school just like you did.
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't airmail your bottom back to civilization.
Sign here.
Welcome to One-Eyed Jack's, Hester.
Twenty-one again. Another winner.
How did you do? Do I have to pay you back?
We'll take it out of my winnings.
Care to sit in? Blackjack is not my game.
Ed, can you count to ten? On a good night.
Then you can win at blackjack.
Gentlemen, place your bets.
Jacques, is it? That's me.
Jade. Here's to old times.
Should old acquaintance be forgot?
Come on, baby. Bottoms up.
One for the road. For old times' sake.
Aloha.
Hey, what's up, doc?
Feel like I'm gonna dream tonight. Big bad ones.
You know?
The kind you like.
Who is this?
Who do you think it is, silly?
I want to see you.
You're not Laura. Okay, doc.
First thing you have to do is go to the door.
Go on.
There's something waiting for you.
It's today's paper, doc. Now do you believe me?
Meet me at Sparkwood and 21.
In ten minutes.
But wait...
You think he bought it?
I think so.
I think he did.
Okay. Wait here for us.
Gazebo.
Say goodbye, James.
﻿1
Where do we look? I don't know. Everywhere.
Where should we start?
Maybe this is something.
Umbrellas?
The Kahala Hilton, July 1969, men on the moon.
August 9, 1974, I first lay eyes on Mimsi.
Weird. Yeah. Heh.
James.
What did you do? I just hit a button.
Hit it again.
There's gotta be a way to turn it off.
My little coconut.
James.
Laura said something on her tape about a coconut.
Oh, my God. The necklace.
Okay, Laura, this is where you shot that video.
Now just tell me,
tell me why you sent me to Sparkwood and 21?
Oh, my God.
No.
Red 36. Sorry, I guess our date's off.
Sir, are you absolutely sure you want another card?
Yes, please.
Twenty-one, can you beat that?
Mother always said I was born lucky.
Maybe later.
Thanks for asking.
This is for you.
I'm a friend of Leo's.
Who's Leo?
Buy you a cocktail, Jacques?
Come in.
Turn around.
Yes, very nice.
Come over here.
Something wrong?
Uh-uh.
This is a good night for you to break in.
The owner's coming by tonight,
he likes to spend some time with all the new girls.
Who's that? No names, child.
You don't offer and you don't ask.
Yes, ma'am.
Pick a card.
Jacques, how long you been dealing blackjack?
Long enough to spot a card counter.
You always let card counters buy you a drink?
I don't see tips like that every day.
Leo ever mentioned me to you?
I don't know, mister. Who are you?
I can't believe Leo never told you about me.
Maybe he did, I don't know.
Leo played you like a violin.
Had you and your brother taking all the risk
running the product across the border.
Never cut you in on a piece of the action.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Take that chip out of your pocket and a look at it.
Go ahead.
That chip has a special significance.
A very special night you spent up at your cabin.
Here's a clue:
"Laura, Laura."
Take it easy. Take it easy.
How do you think a low-rent hump like Leo's
been financing this little operation?
You. I'm the bank.
He never mentioned your name. Course not.
Leo makes the buy with my cash.
You and your brother mule it across the border.
He ever tell you who was distributing stateside?
No. Some high school kid, that's all I know.
That's right.
We're in sync now, Jacques. Can you feel it?
Can you? Yeah, yeah, sure.
Good, because I've got a job for you across the border tonight.
No Leo. No middleman.
It's ten grand.
Half now, half on completion.
How's that sound?
Sounds good.
What are we doing?
You meet me at the water-processing plant on Black Lake in two hours.
Is that gonna be a problem? No.
No problem. Good.
One more question, Jacques.
You know, Leo told me all about that night at the cabin with the girls.
I'm curious about the chip, how'd that happen?
It was that crazy bird.
Bird? It had a thing for Laura.
Saying her name all the time. Like he's in love or something.
So we're all partying.
Girls are all getting pretty high, everybody's pretty crazy.
You, Laura and Ronette.
Leo lets Waldo out of the cage and the bird, he lands on her shoulder.
Laura, she's all tied up.
She liked that, the bird, he starts pecking on her shoulder,
pecking like love pecks or something, you know what I mean?
So Leo,
he's doing a number on her
and Laura, she's screaming about that damn bird.
So Leo takes out a chip.
Puts it in her mouth and says:
"Bite the bullet, baby. Bite the bullet."
Thanks for clearing that up.
Yeah, no problem.
See you on the other side.
Can do, Cappy.
Got a trout on the line, Hawk.
This one's a keeper.
I'm just gonna sit right here, okay?
Come here, sweetie.
Look, we got all night, baby.
Ow.
You made me do this, Shelly. You made me.
Is Lucy talking to you yet?
As we say in the law enforcement game,
it's a cold trail.
Agh. Women.
Harry, Hawk here.
The trout's heading upstream towards the net.
Hawk, hold the line. We'll set the hook.
You got a twenty on Agent Cooper?
He's downstream about ten minutes.
He'll probably miss the catch, but he'll be there when we grill him.
Copy that.
We'll make our move as soon as the big fish shows his fins.
Ready, Andy? Ready, Harry.
Jacques, keep your hands where I can see them.
Put them on the roof of the car, now.
You heard him.
Get in there and cuff him. Don't move.
You're under arrest.
For the attempted murder of Ronette Pulaski
and the murder of Laura Palmer.
Give me your other hand.
He's got my gun. Harry, look out.
My shoulder. Andy.
Call an ambulance? Are you okay, Harry?
Yeah. Shut up, you're all right.
Better call that ambulance.
You have the right to remain silent. Yeah.
Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
You have a right to an attorney.
Hello.
All clear.
Be there as soon as I can.
Hey, what's up, doc?
It's Laura, in case you haven't guessed.
It's Thursday the 23rd and I'm so bored.
Actually, I'm in kind of a weird mood.
God, James is sweet, but he's so dumb.
And right now, I can only take so much of sweet.
Hey, remember that mystery man I told you about?
Well, if I tell you his name, then you're gonna be in trouble.
He wouldn't be such a mystery man anymore,
but you might be history, man.
I think a couple of times he's tried to kill me.
But guess what?
As you know, I sure got off on it.
Isn't sex weird?
This guy can really light my F-l-R-E.
As in red Corvette.
Uh-oh.
Here comes Mom with milk and cookies.
Donna.
Later, Lawrence. Dad?
Bye-bye.
I've got an emergency at the hospital, I don't know when I'll be back.
See if your mother needs anything, huh?
Okay. All right, Dad. I'll call later.
James.
It's okay, I'm glad I heard her say it. I'm glad.
I might have gone my whole life...
I'm sorry you had to hear that. I'm okay.
Jacoby didn't kill her. He was trying to help her.
Then how'd he get the necklace?
You hear that?
You've got about one hour to think about what you've done to me.
And think about it.
Because by then Bobby Briggs is gonna be dead.
You broke my heart.
Goodbye.
It's all here.
Pretty generous, Josie.
Sitting in that concrete box all that time,
90 grand seemed like all the money in creation.
Kept me going.
It's a funny thing.
Back in the world, I don't know,
seems kind of light.
We had an agreement.
I've been going over this in my mind and...
See, if you could follow my thinking,
we're all born into life,
and we have a certain number of years
to move and breathe and have our being.
That's from a book on Oriental philosophy
I read when I was in the joint.
And maybe somebody somewhere knows how much time we have.
I don't, do you?
So when a man gives up a certain portion of his life...
Eighteen months, for instance.
How does he place a value on that time?
Eighteen months, 90,000, what's that?
Five thousand a month?
Well, that's not bad, if you're gonna live another 40 or 50 years.
But what if you only got another 20?
Or ten?
Or some unforeseen event killed you tomorrow?
As in the case of the boating accident
that killed your late husband, Andrew.
Or say you just got out of prison,
where you went in for, uh,
vehicular manslaughter as part of an agreement
to avoid being implicated in the commission of a much greater crime.
Murder.
For which in fact you were responsible.
But now there's this threat,
this possible threat that this fact could be discovered.
And in one stroke ten or 15 or 20 more years of your life
could be cut right off from underneath you.
So I've been asking myself:
"What does that do to the market value of 18 months?"
We had an agreement.
And we still do, sweetheart.
Signed, sealed, delivered.
And I'm gonna take care of everything we agreed to.
See, you want a lot for your money.
And I want a lot for my time.
You know, there's a saying in the joint.
It's not Oriental philosophy,
but it has a similar kind of logic that appeals to my, uh, spiritual nature.
Once you're in business with somebody,
you're in business for life.
Like a marriage.
Partner.
Damn.
Where is it? Where is it?
Catherine?
The account ledger, have you seen it?
Well, don't you keep it in that little safe at home?
No, it's not in the safe at home, it's not here, it's not anywhere.
Tell me you didn't take it.
I didn't take it.
Pete, tell me the truth.
You're not helping her to pull something here.
Who? Josie.
Well, no.
Pull what here?
Oh, Peter, forget everything that we've ever said or done to hurt each other.
Just like that?
Temporarily.
I know our marriage is a living train wreck.
But there used to be something caring between us.
The fellow who caught my eye.
The lumberjack who could scamper up a tree like a cat.
The boss' sister from that big house on the hill.
A summer's indiscretion and here we are.
Catherine.
Oh, Pete.
I never should have taken you to that house up on the hill.
Well, I have no complaints about the house.
As for me, taking my principle pleasure in lashing out at the one person
who was decent enough to stand by me
through all my foolishness.
I know things haven't been easy for you.
Peter, if somewhere under all that scar tissue
there's the faintest flicker of what we used to feel for each other,
I'm asking you to feel that now.
Why?
Exactly.
Because I'm in trouble.
And given what I've become and the way I've treated people,
there's no one else I can turn to.
I need your help.
Catherine. Catherine.
So Fred starts to put the cuffs on him, right.
Now Harry, he turns to go.
Now all of a sudden, Jacques throws an elbow at Fred like this: Wham!
And in one move, takes Fred's gun
and he's got the drop on Harry.
Harry is deader than a pound of roadside stew.
Then all of a sudden, a single shot rings out.
All right.
Andy, my man. All right, Andy.
Go ahead, Andy, give it your best shot. Go on.
Oh, Andy. Oh, Punky.
I'm pregnant.
Uh-oh.
Fresh coffee.
What? Let me talk to the sheriff.
I'm sorry, the sheriff isn't in at the moment.
I expect him back shortly, would you care to leave a message?
You tell him Leo Johnson said to check out James Hurley.
He's an easy rider. An easy rider?
You got that? Yes, I've got that, but Leo?
Wait, Leo?
Dr. John Vincent, ICU,
Dr. John Vincent, ICU.
Did you take Laura and Ronette up to your cabin that night?
You know they'd both been up there before, they was no nuns.
Is that where you took the pictures for Flesh World?
Yeah, that was Laura's idea.
She talked Ronette into, uh, making them ads.
What did you and Leo fight about that night?
Bastard, he hit me with a whiskey bottle.
Why?
I don't know why. That's why we fought. Heh.
I'm bleeding like a stuck pig, and he's laughing.
So you used Leo's shirt to stop the bleeding. What then?
I got sick.
I go outside, pass out.
I wake up, I'm lying on the ground.
Where was Leo?
Leo and the girls, they were gone. Ha, ha.
What about the train car?
I don't know nothing about that.
I come down the hill, Leo's car's gone.
Had to walk 15 miles back to my own house. Heh.
When they brought him in, he was rambling incoherently.
These things he said to you, they're pretty incredible.
I know, let's hope he pulls through.
Well, he's stabilized anyway.
So Leo had to take the girls to the train car by himself.
You believe him? He's too stupid to lie.
He'll testify against Leo. We got him.
We've gotta find Leo first.
Doc, how's Jacoby? He's out of the woods.
Listen, he, uh... He says he got a phone call from Laura Palmer.
He was on his way to see her when he was jumped.
That brought on the heart attack.
Any description of the assailant? He didn't see him.
But he says he saw Laura Palmer standing by the gazebo in Easter Park.
It's not here. It's not here. It's not here either. Damn.
Ahh.
Midge.
Midge Jones.
What are you doing?
It's, uh, my old high school yearbook.
I thought it was gone forever.
Oh, Pete.
Sorry.
What?
It's at the mill. What is?
What you're looking for.
Drying shed 3, near the north gate.
Pete.
Guess I'll look in the other room.
What do you want? Talk terms.
We'll let you know.
Hey, Norma, do you still have that big down comforter on your bed?
Yes, Hank.
Mattresses they give you on your bunk,
they're probably yay thick, you know.
And you lie there at night thinking,
"If this mattress's so skinny, how'd they get all those rocks inside?"
So, uh, you'll forgive me if I tell you
that, uh, night after night,
I dreamed of you lying there on that big feather bed.
I guess the, uh,
hired help shouldn't be so familiar with the boss lady, huh?
I can't blame you for dreaming.
I wasn't just dreaming about being with you, Norma.
What I was trying to...
I shouldn't even be saying this much, heck.
I think you should.
No, I haven't earned the right, Norma.
I've been back what, two days? Say what you wanna say.
I've been trying to picture a whole life with you.
With the diner.
Making it soar. Making it blue sky.
I always talk too big. That's my biggest fault.
I learned that talking to my counselor inside.
This is new territory for me.
But I'm gonna try Norma.
You know, it's 20 years we've been together next month.
Can you believe it?
Maybe we're doing this all backwards.
Maybe it's the next 20 that counts.
Give me time, Norma, I'll make you proud of me yet.
Nadine?
Nadine?
Honey?
Oh, God, Nadine. Don't you do this.
Nadine.
I need an ambulance. My wife has just taken some pills.
422 Riverside.
For the love of God, hurry.
Stay with me, Nadine.
Please don't go.
Stay with me.
Leo Johnson's gone underground.
My bet is he's holed up somewhere near his home.
Sheriff, Leo Johnson called.
When? About ten minutes ago.
He left this message.
And sheriff, in the background, when I spoke to him,
I could hear a clock striking.
What kind of clock, Lucy?
It sounded like the clock at Easter Park.
Harry. Hawk.
Good work, Lucy.
Hawk, pull the surveillance off Leo's house,
I want you to set up a perimeter around Easter Park.
Got it.
I'll radio. You get some cars over there.
Harry, I gotta talk to you. Sure.
Harry, let me talk to James.
You wanna investigate this?
Come on, James.
Harry.
Harry, is it true?
You've found him. You've got the killer?
We've arrested a suspect, Leland, that's all.
But is it the man, Harry? Is it him?
We can't release any details right now.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Leland, there's nothing you can do here.
You should be home with Sarah now.
Well, yes, you're right. Of course, you're right.
You going back to the hospital? No. I'm heading home.
Thank you, Will. Don't give it a thought.
Hospital.
Think you ought to listen to this tape.
Why is that?
It was Laura's. We found it.
I think it'll help you find who you're looking for.
Who might that be?
Somebody with a red Corvette.
Dr. Jacoby's in the hospital with a heart attack.
Heart attack? He said he saw Laura Palmer tonight.
James, what kind of dangerous game have you been playing?
Is Jacoby gonna be all right?
I've been very patient with you, James.
From here on out, I'm gonna need a better set of answers.
Let's start with why this was in the gas tank of your bike.
Fine, fine, fine.
Okay, okay. Uh-huh.
Ghostwood. Fantastic. I love it. Mm! Ha-ha-ha.
All your revisions are included.
Ben, I am so happy I can't even say how much.
After you. No, no, no, after you.
After me. Ha-ha-ha.
Excuse me.
Benjamin Horne here.
Time to Black Flag that little firebug.
Leo Johnson's gonna get a house call.
Proceed.
Shelly?
Shelly, are you here?
Shelly's not here, Bobby.
Leo, man, am I glad to see you.
Was there something I could help you with?
Actually, it's you I was looking for, the cops, man, they're after you.
Liar.
Shelly's dead. You killed her. Aah! Unh!
No, Leo.
Later, Leo.
I can't understand a word you're saying,
you have a thing in your mouth.
Who are you? Shelly Johnson.
You know who called me here?
No, I don't know anything, please help me...
Be quiet, I'm thinking.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Any of the boys still inside? Not sure. Shift was over.
But we're still trying to get a count.
Seen Catherine? No, Pete.
That's her car.
Jesus God, you think she's still inside?
I guess I'm gonna have to find out.
Pete, that ain't such a good idea.
She's still my wife.
Catherine.
And that is that.
Ben, is this a great moment? Ghostwood.
Incredible. Ghostwood. Huh?
Einar, tonight, you play on the house.
This is marvelous, eh?
Enjoy, my friend. Enjoy.
To Ghostwood.
To Ghostwood Estates and Country Club.
Congratulations, boss.
Blackie, old pal,
this calls for a celebration.
Let's have a look at the new girl.
Good luck, honey.
Close your eyes.
This is such stuff as dreams are made of.
Diane.
4:37 a.m.
After a long investigative night,
returning to my room at The Great Northern.
We have one suspect in custody
and Leo Johnson, the man I believe is responsible for Laura's death,
won't be able to escape the dragnet we've thrown up for him much longer.
As you can hear from the ambient sound around me,
and I notice with some relief that the Icelandic group
staying on my floor have either checked or passed out.
I may not need the Ear-Pillow Earplugs,
which I did receive today, Diane,
although I suspect I may put them to use
as a purely precautionary measure.
I ordered some hot milk from room service.
Hoping that does the job
and I'll be able to catch a few hours of quality sack time.
Twenty-four hour room service
must be one of the premier achievements of modern civilization.
"My special agent."
Cooper here.
Who is this?
Couldn't this wait until tomorrow morning?
Please excuse me, I've got room service.
Agent Cooper, we found Leo Johnson.
He's been shot. Agent Cooper?
﻿1
Agent Cooper.
Can you hear me? It's Andy.
Agent Cooper, it's Andy.
Can you hear me?
Agent Cooper?
Room service.
How are you doing down there?
Warm milk.
Agent Cooper?
Would you put it on the table, please?
And would you call a doctor? Sure.
Are you all right? Can you hear me?
Agent Cooper.
Agent Cooper, it's Andy. Can you hear me?
Are you all right?
Agent Cooper. Agent Cooper.
Agent Cooper.
It's Andy.
It's An...
I hung it up for you.
What's that?
Hung it up for you.
Did you call the doctor?
The doctor?
It's hung up.
The phone.
Thank you.
Sure.
No problem.
Does this include a gratuity?
Yes, sir.
Thank you. Thank you kindly.
The milk will get cool on you.
Pretty soon. Okay.
I've heard about you.
I heard about you.
I will tell you three things.
If I tell them to you and they come true,
then will you believe me?
Who's that?
Think of me as a friend.
Where do you come from?
The question is, where have you gone?
The first thing I will tell you is,
there's a man
in a smiling bag.
Man in a smiling bag.
Second thing is,
the owls are not what they seem.
Third thing is,
without chemicals, he points.
What do these things mean?
This is all I am permitted to say.
Give me your ring.
I will return it to you when you find these things to be true.
We want to help you.
Who's "we"?
One last thing.
Leo locked inside hungry horse.
There's a clue at Leo's house.
You will require medical attention.
Knock, knock, knock.
Come on.
Let's have a look at the new girl.
Ow, mm.
Vixen.
What room is Ben in?
The little flower room.
Why is he holding out on me? What?
Why is he holding out on me? What's that, Blackie?
Who's holding out on who?
Please.
Oh, Blackie.
You used to be so pretty.
Blackie, Blackie.
Bastard.
I think you should go now.
Do you, Prudence? Yes, I do. I really do.
Hmm.
All right.
If you insist.
Gotcha. Ha, ha!
I will huff
and puff,
and blow your house down.
Oh, my, my.
Aren't you something?
I've got to see you. I must see you.
Go away. I'm shy.
Didn't they tell you who I was?
The owner?
That's right.
Ben, it's Jer. We got a situation.
So have I.
Brother Ben, we got a S-N-A-G.
Alas, I do have a situation. Come on, Ben.
Coming, Jer.
I like you.
You know how to interest a man. That's half the battle.
Next time, we will play a different game.
I'll make the rules.
You'll like it. Fun game.
Everybody wins.
Diane.
My recorder is on the table.
I'm unable to reach it at this time.
I can only hope that I inadvertently pressed
the voice-activation button.
I'm lying on the floor of my room.
I've been shot.
There's a great deal of pain and a fair amount of blood.
Fortunately, I was wearing my bulletproof vest last night,
per bureau regulations when working undercover.
I remember folding the vest up,
trying to chase down a wood tick.
If you can imagine the impact on your chest
of three bowling balls dropped from a height of about 9 feet,
you might begin to approximate the sensation.
All things considered,
being shot is not as bad as I always thought it might be.
As long as you can keep the fear from your mind.
But I guess you could say that about almost anything in life.
It's not so bad as long as you can keep the fear from your mind.
Oh, my God.
The ring is gone.
At a time like this, curiously,
you begin to think of the things you regret
or the things you might miss.
I would like, in general, to treat people with much more care and respect.
I would like to climb a tall hill.
Not too tall.
Sit in the cool grass.
Not too cool.
And feel the sun on my face.
I wish I could have cracked the Lindbergh kidnapping case.
I would very much like to make love to a beautiful woman
who I had genuine affection for.
And of course, it goes without saying that I would like to visit Tibet.
I wish they could get their country back and the Dalai Lama could return.
Oh, I would like that very much.
All in all, a very interesting experience.
They're here.
My skin was itching.
Wood tick was crawling.
I lifted my bulletproof vest.
Three slugs.
Point-blank range.
That explains this.
Hell of a way to kill a tick.
Did you get a look at the gunman?
I saw a masked face, muzzle flash.
Lucy, you better bring Agent Cooper up-to-date.
Leo Johnson was shot.
Jacques Renault was strangled.
The mill burned. Shelly and Pete got smoke inhalation.
Catherine and Josie are missing.
Nadine is in a coma from taking sleeping pills.
How long have I been out? It's 7:45 in the morning.
We haven't had this much action in one night
since the Elk's Club fire of '59.
Harry, we need to get a search warrant for Leo Johnson's house.
No need. Leo was shot in his own living room.
Deputy Brennan found him.
You're not going anywhere. Doc. When the will is invoked,
the recuperative powers of the physical body are simply extraordinary.
Just give me a couple of hours to get dressed.
I'm standing just in front of where a massive log-storage area
of the Packard Saw Mill burned to the ground,
under what fire department investigators are calling
"mysterious circumstances."
Now, police officials have told me that they have, as of yet,
Bobby. uncovered no apparent link
between these two seemingly unrelated
Bobby. tragedies.
Reporting live from the Packard Saw Mill...
Cooper, this is totally against my recommendations.
It's all right, doc. Duly noted.
You got two busted ribs, your cartilage is a mess.
Who knows what else is wrong?
What's that?
Jacques Renault.
Is that bag smiling?
Smiling?
What's there to smile about?
Do you miss Beth?
What?
Have you been missing your mom?
Aunt Sarah? Yeah?
I had the strangest dream last night.
About what?
The rug.
Right here.
Right from this angle where I'm sitting.
Was Laura in it?
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And liddle lamzy divey A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats And liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?
Now, if the words sound queer And funny to your ear
A little bit jumbled and jivey
Say, "Mares eat oats And does eat oats
And little lambs eat ivy"
Leland?
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats And liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?
Morning, dears.
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And liddle lamzy divey
Oh, Leland.
Uncle Leland's hair turned white.
Leland, come back here.
Oh, God.
Okay. Agenda.
One.
I want a location on Catherine.
Keep our distance, just make sure she's ready to take the fall.
Two.
I want a complete medical on Leo Johnson
and his prospects for recovery
and a satisfactory explanation from Hank Jennings
why Leo isn't being measured for a plot in Ghostwood Memorial Park.
Well begun is half done.
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And liddle lamzy divey A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats And liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?
Now, if the words sound queer And funny to your ear
A little bit jumbled and jivey
Say, "Mares eat oats And does eat oats
And little lambs eat ivy"
I'm back.
Back and ready.
But the bullet came from outside.
How do you figure?
Sheriff, a picture is forming.
Big ax on the couch.
These same geese were flying that evening.
Leo was trying to turn someone into kindling.
That person hit the TV, moved it.
You can see the depression in the carpet.
Shelly?
Shelly Johnson's about 99 pounds soaking wet.
This is a big TV.
Leo advanced, ax raised.
Then what happened?
Bullet came through the window, knocked Leo back onto the couch.
Do you think it was Shelly who pulled the trigger?
Sheriff, get your mind off Shelly, for a moment.
We won't know about Shelly until we find out what time she got to the mill.
Surprise. Flesh World.
Hey, what issue is this?
Still no cocaine. Here or in the truck.
But I found this in the truck.
Leo's duster.
Reeks of gasoline. The mill.
Good work, Hawk.
Harry, do you know who it is?
Harry, do you know who it is?
Harry. What's that?
Harry, do you know who it is? It's Andy.
He seems pretty upset about something.
Harry, it's Agent Rosenflower.
Andy, are you all right?
Hey, Andy.
Are you all right?
And it's another great moment in law enforcement history.
Hey, Albert.
Looks like you were more right than you know.
Looks like a new pair of boots and a lot of cocaine.
Andy.
Good work.
Hot damn that pie is good!
Here's Laura's glasses that you wanted.
Thanks.
Donna, do you see these glasses that I'm wearing?
Yeah.
I hate them.
I'm never wearing these again.
Okay.
Is it true about James?
He spent the night in jail.
Do you think it's because of what we did?
Look, we don't know if we did anything.
My dad said Jacoby got sick because he was attacked.
All we did was send him a tape.
Maybe he wouldn't have been attacked if we hadn't.
Maybe. Maybe the sun won't come up tomorrow if you wash your hair.
Think like that and you're gonna go crazy. What's done is done.
The only way this won't come back to haunt us
is if we keep quiet about what happened last night.
I can assure you James is doing the same thing.
Get the picture?
Loud and clear.
Uncle Leland's hair turned white.
Really?
White as a sheet.
Weird.
Donna, I have something for you.
Came here to the Double R yesterday.
Thanks, Norma.
God. What is it?
"Look into the Meals on Wheels."
How simple can I make it, Cooper?
FBI agent gets shot, FBI agent investigates.
I'm in proximity, work in the Seattle lab, I'm familiar with the underlying case.
Ugh! Yes. Does that hurt?
Albert, the point is, you're not gonna win any local popularity contests.
No, the point is Gordon Cole ordered me back here.
Breathe.
Again.
Okay.
You were shot by a right-handed person, 5'6 "to 5'10" tall,
at a distance of less than 3 feet. I'll have ballistics this afternoon.
You're still blank on the other details? Yes.
What was your vest doing riding up like that?
Wood tick.
Meanwhile, one of your principle suspects is killed in his hospital bed,
the other is shot in his living room.
Vigilante justice or just clean country living?
Albert, where does this attitude of general unpleasantness come from?
I'll have to get back to you on that.
If you don't want two black eyes on a regular basis,
I suggest you make some kind of peace with rural life.
Great. After the square dance, maybe we can all take a hayride.
Come in.
Andy, how's the nose?
Not a mark on it, only blood squirted out.
Where do they keep his water dish?
Albert.
Agent Cooper, guess what.
I have the answer to the riddle that you told me this morning.
I called Hungry Horse, Montana.
The word "locked."
Leo Johnson was locked in a jail in Hungry Horse, Montana.
When, Andy?
"February 9, 1988."
Teresa Banks.
Looks like Leo has an alibi for the night Teresa Banks was murdered.
Good work, Andy.
Yeah. Woof.
Excuse me.
Is Sheriff Truman here? He is, but he is busy at the moment.
May I help you?
I'm afraid I don't have an appointment.
The sheriff asked me to stop by
at my convenience.
This is the first convenient moment. Heh.
May I ask what this is regarding?
I'm here to sell him some shoes.
Shoes?
Uh-oh. Here comes Mom
with milk and cookies.
Later, Lawrence.
Bye-bye.
You got this tape from Dr. Jacoby's office?
Yeah.
That's breaking and entering, James.
The door was open.
How did you know Jacoby wouldn't be there?
I knocked, nobody answered.
You were alone? Yeah.
Okay. I know you were trying to help,
but there's some people who might not see it that way.
Especially with 3 ounces of cocaine in your gas tank.
You know I didn't put that there.
I think it was probably Mike and Bobby.
Yeah. Harry,
Laura talks on her tape about a mystery man.
A red Corvette. Leo Johnson.
I think it was somebody else. Not Jacques Renault either.
Why do you say that?
I never put it together until I heard the tape.
Where she says, "This guy can really light my fire."
Well, I remember this one night when we first started seeing each other.
She was still doing drugs then.
Well, we were in the woods and she started saying this scary poem,
over and over, about fire.
And then she said:
"Would you like to play with fire, little boy?"
"Would you like to play with Bob?"
What did she mean by that? I don't know.
Laura said a lot of nutty stuff.
Half the time, it just went right by you.
This stuck, though.
James, I'll get right to the point.
I know you have the other half of Laura Palmer's necklace.
I want it. Give it to me.
How?
Well, this was in Jacoby's office.
It was in a coconut.
A coconut?
Hawk, take James back to his cell.
Jacoby?
How did you know he had the necklace?
Laura and James were in love.
I figured he had to have the other half of the necklace,
but if he had the other half,
he would have given it to us to help with the case.
Then it dawned on me.
Something or someone frightened him off.
He had to have it, so I asked him for it.
Jacoby?
I didn't figure he had anything to do with this at all.
Sometimes you just get lucky.
Donna?
Hi, Lucy.
I'm here to see James.
How are you doing?
Did you tell them anything?
They haven't asked me anything.
When did you start smoking?
I smoke every once in a while.
Helps relieve tension.
When did you get so tense?
When I started smoking.
Did you tell them anything?
I didn't tell them about you or Maddy.
Do they think Leo killed Laura?
I don't know what they think.
How is Maddy?
She's fine.
She hasn't said anything either.
So don't you wanna kiss me?
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
Or is it just not okay for me to want you?
Get out soon, James.
Lucy.
Andy.
In these boxes is every edition of Flesh World
published for the past three years.
This is a picture of Teresa Banks, the first victim,
who was found murdered a year ago in the southern part of the state.
Now, Laura and Ronette's photographs appeared in ads in the magazines.
You want us to look for a picture of Teresa Banks.
Andy, you're way ahead of me.
Lucy, Sheriff Truman and I will be at the hospital.
Behave yourselves.
Diane, just received the back issues of Flesh World. Good work.
It's nice to see some cooperation with the law,
especially from a company that preys on human weaknesses.
Lucy, I sure feel uncomfortable being in this situation with you.
Why? We're both professionals.
Is he on something?
Only what you prescribed.
I think he did take a little bit of his food.
My God, could that be it?
Agent Cooper.
Why don't you tell the psychiatrist
about your broken ribs and torn cartilage.
Well, well, well.
What happened to you?
I don't want any baloney, magic tricks or psychological mumbo jumbo.
I want you to tell us how you came into possession of this
or I am gonna have to place you under arrest for obstruction of justice.
Look, I told you.
The night after Laura died, I followed a man in a red Corvette.
Leo Johnson.
Correct.
Then he eluded me somewhere near the old sawmill road.
As I sat there, cursing my...
My lack of horsepower,
a motorcycle drove by.
Followed by a police cruiser.
But you lost them.
They went into the woods.
I saw them. I followed them in there on foot.
James and Donna? Yes, they...
They spoke intently for a while, but I couldn't hear what they were saying.
I remember it was...
It was a cold night in the woods.
Finally, they...
They buried something in the ground, under a rock.
Ill-advisedly, perhaps,
I took it as a keepsake.
It was her, you see.
The necklace.
A divided heart.
Laura was...
Was, in fact...
Well, she was living a double life.
Two people.
Yeah, but then...
Then when I saw her that last time, she...
I don't know, she seemed to have reached a kind of...
A peace with herself.
Now I believe that
what she had in fact arrived at
was a decision to end her life.
Are you saying Laura wanted to die?
Doctor,
Laura Palmer did not commit suicide.
No, no.
But maybe she allowed herself to be killed.
One more thing.
You were in intensive care last night when Jacques Renault was killed.
Yeah, yes. But I mean, come on, fellows.
I was heavily sedated and...
Did you see anything? Hear anything?
I remember hearing a fire alarm go off, but...
It's...
It's all like a...
Like a dream.
There was a smell.
Yeah, there was a peculiar smell.
It's usual in case of strangulation for the victim to void his bowels.
No.
No, that wasn't it, this...
This was a smell like...
Like oil.
Scorched engine oil.
Dr. Bradley, call the operator.
Dr. Bradley, call the operator, please.
Hey, sleeping beauty.
Bobby.
What are you doing here? What if someone sees you?
I don't care. I do not care anymore.
Leo's in the hospital.
Somebody shot him.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I heard there's cops outside his room.
Really? I hear they're gonna bust him.
He must have got caught doing something, poor bastard.
What happened to you?
Bobby, I'm so afraid.
Leo tried to kill me.
He knows about us.
He took me up to the mill,
and he tied me up and started the fire.
Bobby,
he told me he was gonna kill you.
Fat chance.
I won't let him hurt us anymore.
Are you all right?
Doctors seem to think so.
You know, Shelly, hospitals are dangerous places.
First of all, they're crawling with sick people.
And second of all, that food can kill you.
So if you wanna get out of here pronto,
you're gonna have to let Bobby be your doctor.
So let's just have a look here, Miss Shelly.
Oh, you seem to be coming along splendidly.
Deep breath.
I'd say you're on your way to a complete recovery.
You better go.
You're my girl.
Bobby.
I love you.
I guess I love you too.
Yeah, I guess I love you too.
Bobby Briggs.
What's he doing here? He doesn't look sick.
Sheriff Truman, to see this kind of investigative genius at work,
it's just a real treat for me.
Ed.
How are you doing? I heard you stopped a couple.
I'm okay. How's Nadine?
Well, she's in a coma.
They say there's nothing we could do. She has to wanna come back.
How are you holding up?
Well, all I can do is sit here,
thinking about the things I should have said or done.
Ed, don't be too hard on yourself.
I never believed in fate, Agent Cooper.
I always felt
you make your own way, you take care of your own, you pick up after yourself.
Farmer's Almanac?
Albert, I would like to speak to Ed.
Albert, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
Take a seat, Ed.
I saw this coming.
I didn't wanna believe it.
What's worse is I'm sitting thinking that maybe there's a part of me
that didn't wanna stop her.
And that's a full load.
When did you get married, Ed?
Right out of high school.
Norma and I had been together about four years.
Everybody figured we'd get hitched. That'd be that.
I barely knew Nadine to say hello to.
That spring, one bad weekend,
Norma ran off with Hank.
I was so twisted up inside, I couldn't see straight.
When I opened my eyes,
there was Nadine, right in front of me.
There was something so sweet,
so helpless about her.
We drove all night.
Ended up in some little town in Montana, out past Great Falls,
and I asked her to marry me.
Half joking, half drunk, half crazy.
It was light before we found a justice of the peace.
And Norma...
Well, she hadn't even slept with Hank.
The look on her face when she found out...
Nadine and I, we went up to my dad's old cabin up in Eagle Pass.
Honeymoon.
I was hoping maybe we'd get around to talking about a divorce,
annulment, something.
But Nadine was so happy.
And you know, by golly,
I shot out Nadine's eye on that honeymoon.
What do you mean, Ed?
The first day, we were hunting pheasant.
Nadine's a crack shot and we already had a couple of birds.
And I felt good shooting.
Listening to the sound echoing, roll down those hills.
I fired.
A piece of buckshot skipped off a rock and caught Nadine square in the eye.
Man, that's a tough one.
She laid across my lap as we drove back to town.
She never cried.
She never blamed me.
She never hated me for it.
Couple of months later, Norma married Hank.
So I don't believe in fate. You make your bed, you sleep in it.
Sorry.
Ed, someone here to see you.
A man in a smiling bag.
Take James right back to the station when you're done here.
Poor Ed.
Poor Nadine.
Yeah. Yeah.
Albert, why don't you take this opportunity
to check in at The Great Northern?
Nurse, I really mean it, you better speak to that kitchen.
Harry, when Albert finishes up at The Great Northern,
we'll meet back at the station.
I'm ready to lay the whole thing out.
Rocks and bottles?
Chalk and blackboard will be just fine.
Jelly doughnuts? Harry, that goes without saying.
I'll come back later and I'll bring some soup.
The food in these places will kill you quicker than most diseases.
Heh. So I hear.
Now, you know I have a sweet tooth too.
I've got a chocolate-peanut butter pie.
Norma, I'm serious.
Bring the whole pie.
I'll bring you two.
Okay.
Feel better, sweetie. Bye.
Bye.
Son.
Dad.
Would you
care to join me?
Okay.
How was school today?
School?
Fine.
That's good.
How was work?
Work? Work was good.
Dad? Yes, son?
What is it that you do, exactly?
That's classified.
Oh.
Bobby, would you care for a piece of pie?
The huckleberries are particularly delicious today.
Particularly fresh and delicious.
No, thanks.
Bobby,
may I share something with you?
Okay.
A vision I had in my sleep last night.
As distinguished from a dream,
which is mere sorting and cataloging
of the day's events by the subconscious.
This was a vision.
Fresh and clear as a mountain stream.
The mind revealing itself to itself.
In my vision,
I was on the veranda of a vast estate,
a palazzo of some fantastic proportion.
There seemed to emanate from it a light from within this
gleaming, radiant marble.
I'd known this place. I had, in fact, been born and raised there.
This was my first return.
A reunion with the deepest wellsprings of my being.
Wandering about, I noticed happily
that the house had been immaculately maintained.
There had been added a number of additional rooms,
but in a way that blended so seamlessly with the original construction
one would never detect any difference.
Returning to the house's grand foyer,
there came a knock at the door.
My son was standing there.
He was happy and carefree.
Clearly living a life of deep harmony and joy.
We embraced.
A warm and loving embrace, nothing withheld.
We were, in this moment, one.
My vision ended and I awoke with a tremendous feeling
of optimism and confidence
in you and your future.
That was my vision of you.
Really?
I'm so glad to have had this opportunity to share it with you.
I wish you nothing but the very best in all things.
Thank you, Dad.
See you later. Call. Okay.
Major?
How was the pie?
Exceptional, as always.
How is Shelly?
I can't talk right now.
Well, how did she like the flowers?
The night Laura Palmer was killed, it appears she made two appointments.
In her diary she had written, "Nervous about meeting J tonight."
I now believe this was a reference to James Hurley.
She was nervous because she planned to tell him
she didn't wanna see him anymore.
Before she snuck out of the house, she received a phone call.
We believe it was Leo Johnson making the second appointment
for sometime later that night.
Laura met James, was with him until 12:30,
when, at the intersection of Sparkwood and 21,
she jumped from the bike and ran into the woods.
We believe she met up there with Jacques Renault,
Leo Johnson and Ronette Pulaski.
Together, they drove to the foot of the trail leading to Jacques' cabin.
They climbed the trail, they were heard passing by the cabin of the Log Lady.
They reached Jacques Renault's cabin at approximately 1 a.m.
Drugs and alcohol were consumed. Laura was tied up
and had sexual relations with both Leo and Jacques.
Waldo the bird was let out of his cage and attacked Laura.
Leo and Jacques fought. Jacques went outside and passed out.
When he came to, Leo and the girls were gone.
We believe Leo hiked back down the trail to his Corvette alone,
leaving the girls behind.
The reason being, there was a third man.
Deputy Hawk found evidence of a third man
outside the window of Jacques' cabin.
The third man took Laura and Ronette to the train
where they were tied up.
Laura for the second time, Ronette for the first.
Using a blunt object, the killer hit Ronette
and knocked her unconscious.
He must have been so intent on killing Laura,
he didn't realize that Ronette regained consciousness and escaped.
Either he didn't know or he didn't care.
He made a small mound of dirt
and put the half-heart necklace of Laura's on top.
He then placed a small cut out letter R under the nail of her left ring finger.
You'll recall that he placed the letter T under the fingernail of Teresa Banks.
He left a note written in blood, "Fire walk with me."
Here's the interesting thing.
The blood on the note was tested. It doesn't match Leo's,
Jacques', Laura's or Ronette's.
So we surmise the killer wrote the note in his own blood.
It's a rare type, AB negative.
The towel that Deputy Hawk found five miles down the tracks
was soaked in blood of that type.
He also found, near the towel, scraps of faded paper.
These scraps may have been left by the killer.
They'll be sent back to Washington, D.C., for testing.
I know, Andy. I know, I know, I know.
It's what we call a real three-hankie crime.
Albert Rozerfeld,
I don't like the way you talk smart about Sheriff Truman or anybody.
You just shut your mouth!
Laura Palmer is dead.
Jacques Renault is dead.
Ronette Pulaski and Leo Johnson are in comas.
Waldo the bird is dead.
This leaves only the third man.
You want this door closed? Yeah, yeah. We'll frost our rooms.
Oh.
I sure do appreciate the ride, Harry. No problem.
I always appreciate your company, Pete.
Oh.
Boy, this smoke inhalation is nasty business.
I feel like somebody taped my lips to the tailpipe of a bus.
Take her easy.
So where the hell is Josie? Oh, well, maybe this will tell us.
"Dear Pete,
I had to leave the town
on an emergency of business to Seattle.
I will phone you when I arrive.
Hope you did a good day at the mill.
There is ginger beer in the refrig. Love, Josie." There you go.
Is there a phone number in there? No.
Does she say where she's staying? No, no, she goes off to Seattle
once every three months or so.
You want my opinion, I think she goes over there to indulge a secret vice.
What's that? Shopping.
Comes back with half a department store.
Pete,
we haven't found Catherine.
Yeah.
I figured.
I know you wanna hope for the best,
but you ought to prepare for the worst.
Oh, dear.
I always figured I'd be the one to go first.
I mean, if you was laying odds
on the last person standing after an atomic war,
I'd have bet on her.
Yeah, she was a tiger, all right.
Ah, no use mincing words.
She was plain hell to live with.
Plain hell.
But
once, there was a little bit of heaven there too.
Oh, I'm sure there was.
Oh, God.
This will take a little while to sink in, I suppose.
I suppose it will.
God help her miserable soul.
I loved her.
Blue Pine Lodge.
Could I speak to Josie Packard, please?
Well, she's not here right now. Can you tell me when she'll be back?
Well, she's out of town. Who's calling?
I'd like to place an international call, please.
Collect to Hong Kong.
Doesn't that sound?
I mean, I ate it, but I didn't really know what it was.
I read about it in this French magazine,
and they take the entire head and dip it in a kind of blancmange pudding.
And then they roll it in oats and stuff it full of walnuts and hot rocks
and a spice cookie. Mr. Horne, Mr. Horne.
They wrap it in papillon. Mr. Horne, Mr. Horne.
They seal the edges
with a sugar glaze... Mm.
...and bake it under glass. Mr. Horne, Mr. Horne.
Ah. That sounds incredible.
It is to die for.
Have you seen Audrey today?
No, I haven't.
Hank Jennings.
Jerry and Benjamin Horne.
Where's Josie?
She left last night.
Prearranged?
She wanted to put a little distance between her and the smell of smoke.
Sound strategy.
Next business, Leo Johnson.
He's in a coma.
Looks like brain damage.
With Leo, how could they tell?
Why isn't he dead?
I caught him center shot with a.44.
Couldn't risk going inside.
Neighborhood was hot. I had to sneak past patrols as it was.
Anybody see you?
Negative.
He was chopping wood.
Chopping wood? Inside?
Yeah, you know Leo. Wait a minute.
Chopping wood inside? Yeah.
You know Leo.
All right. What's next?
Catherine.
Dead?
My phone call put her in the drying shed when the place went up.
Sounds like buried with the wreckage.
Heat like that, they'll be lucky to find teeth.
And they were such pretty teeth.
Marvelous.
Gentlemen,
if they don't hang the arson on the late lamented Catherine
and her coconspirator Leo,
I'll give up sex.
That's confidence.
What do we do with the ledger?
Hank,
you leave the creative thinking to the brothers Horne.
You're a bicep. Relax until we say, "Flex."
Now, that really makes me mad.
You guys. Ha-ha-ha.
Come in.
Why is the door to my room locked?
And who's the refrigerator?
The owner was a little disappointed in your performance last night.
Well, the owner isn't exactly my type.
And what is your type exactly?
Not you. No offense.
Hey.
Let's get one thing straight between us, princess.
Okay.
I don't wanna hear another complaint about you.
When you work for me,
everybody's your type.
Norma?
Hi, it's Donna.
I'm calling about Meals on Wheels.
I'm gonna take over Laura's route if that's okay with you.
Okay.
Great.
Listen, can I use the Double R station wagon?
All right.
Great.
Then I'll see you tomorrow at 9.
Gersten's gonna tell us about tonight's proceedings.
She has some very good news. We're all very proud of her.
Good evening.
I'm Gersten Hayward and I'd like to welcome you all
to the Hayward Supper Club.
I'm going to be playing various selections
of music for you this evening.
My good news is that I was chosen
to be the fairy princess in my school play.
This is my special dress.
Also, I got the highest scores in mathematics and English
this midseason term,
just as my sisters, Harriet and Donna, did before me.
So now I don't have to worry about being ashamed anymore.
Before I play, Harriet would like to read a poem
about your daughter and our friend Laura.
Um...
It was Laura
And I saw her glowing
In the dark woods
I saw her smiling
We were crying and I saw her
Laughing
In our sadness I saw her dancing
It was Laura living in my dreams
It was Laura
The glow was life
Her smile was to say
It was all right to cry
The woods was our sadness
The dance was her calling
It was Laura
And she came to kiss me goodbye
That was wonderful. Thank you.
Gersten.
Now I'm going to play Mendelssohn's "Rondo Capriccioso, Opus 14."
I got the list and map for Meals on Wheels.
I'm going to start tomorrow.
Aces.
Long day, Will?
I feel like I've sat through back-to-back operas.
In med school, we learned to live on three hours a night and catnaps.
It's terrible about the mill.
Yeah. They say more than 150 jobs may be lost.
Awful. Just awful.
I suppose this will open the door
for Ben Horne and his big development plans.
Well, as his lawyer, and yours,
of course I can't comment. Hmm.
Well, as your doctor, Leland,
what the hell happened to your hair?
It is strange, isn't it?
Well, I just, uh...
I woke up this morning, looked in the mirror, and there it was.
It had literally changed overnight.
Well, considering all you've been through...
You know, the funny thing about it is,
seeing it, I realized that I had
turned a corner somehow.
I feel a great deal of sadness still, yes,
but it wasn't as overwhelming to me.
I physically felt as if a great weight had been lifted from my heart.
Perhaps it has. Perhaps it has.
Perhaps it has.
God, I feel like singing.
That would be very nice.
No, I really feel like singing a song.
Leland? Come on, everybody. Get happy.
"Get Happy." "Get Happy"?
Mm-hm.
Forget your troubles And just get happy
You gotta pack all your cares away
Sing hallelujah Come on, get happy
Get ready for the judgment day
The sun is shinin' Come on, get happy
The Lord is waitin' to take your hand
Sing hallelujah Come on, get happy
We're going to that promised land
We're headin' 'cross the river Wash your sins away in the tide
It's, oh, so peaceful on the other side
Forget your troubles Come on, get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing hallelujah Come on, get happy
Get ready for the judgment day
Sing hallelujah Come on, get happy
Get ready for the judgment day
Sing hallelujah Come on, get happy
Get ready for the judgment d...
Donna, get my bag.
Leland?
Dad, is he okay? I'm sure it's nothing serious.
Oh. Oh, God.
I feel happy.
"Begin the Beguine."
Diane, it's 11:55 p.m.,
approximately 19 hours since the shooting incident
which nearly caused me to make a premature purchase
of the proverbial farm.
I'm dog-tired.
A man can only go so long without submitting to a period of rest.
For as we know from experiments
conducted on American Gis during the Korean War,
sleep deprivation is a one-way ticket to temporary psychosis.
And I'm working on a three-day jag.
I got so goofy last night, Diane,
lying here wondering whether I was going to live or die,
that I thought I saw a giant in my room.
Or perhaps that's a story I'll save for another time.
This is me, Dale,
Room 315 at The Great Northern Hotel, signing off.
Special agent.
Special agent. Special agent.
Special agent, are you there?
I left you a note. Didn't you get my note?
I slipped it under your door. You must have seen it.
Well, I'm up here at One-Eyed Jack's.
To be perfectly honest, I think I'm in a little over my head.
Not that I can't handle it.
I mean, if I'm gonna help you out with your investigations,
I'm sure I'll be put into situations a lot more dangerous than this
on a fairly regular basis.
But it's just,
you know, my first time out.
I could use a little expert guidance.
So you know, there is a connection
between Horne's Department Store and One-Eyed Jack's.
It's my father. He owns the place.
Little ball of sleaze named Battis helps to recruit some of the girls
from the perfume counter.
Tomorrow I'm gonna try to find out if Laura and Ronette came up here.
I hope you won't think any less of me for trying to help you.
You know, I promise I only did it with the best of intentions.
And if there's any way...
If there's any way in the world that you can hear me right now,
please help me.
Help me. Help me.
Sorry to wake you.
I am not dreaming.
I forgot to tell you something.
You were right about the smiling bag.
The things I tell you will not be wrong.
Better to listen than to talk.
I believe you.
Don't search for all the answers at once.
A path is formed by laying one stone at a time.
One person saw the third man.
Three have seen him, yes,
but not his body.
One only known to you.
Ready now to talk.
One more thing.
You forgot something.
What?
Laura! Laura!
Laura!
﻿1
Buddhist tradition first came to the land of snow
in the 5th century A.D.
The first Tibetan king to be touched by the dharma
was King Hathatha Rignamputsan.
He and succeeding kings were collectively known
as the Happy Generations.
Now, some historians place them in a Water Snake year, 213 A.D.
Others in the year of a Water Ox, 173 A.D.
Amazing, isn't it? The Happy Generations.
Agent Cooper, I am thrilled to pieces that the dharma came
to King Ho-Ho-Ho, I really am,
but I'm trying to focus on the more immediate problems
of our own century here in Twin Peaks.
Albert, you'd be surprised at the connection between the two.
Color me amazed.
Ronette Pulaski has woken from her coma.
And?
I'm thinking she's gonna have quite a story to tell,
when she regains the ability to speak. So she's not talking?
Mm. Waking but silent, probably shock.
I'm gonna show her the sketches of Leo Johnson and Bob,
the man Sarah Palmer saw in her vision.
The man who came to me in my dream.
Has anyone seen Bob on Earth in the last few weeks?
No, not yet.
Okay. I performed the autopsy on Jacques Renault.
Stomach contents revealed...
Let's see. beer cans, a Maryland license plate,
half a bicycle tire, a goat and a small wooden puppet,
goes by the name of Pinocchio.
You're making a joke.
I like to think of myself as one of the Happy Generations.
And by the way, the fat boy wasn't strangled.
Killer snuffed him with a pillow. He was wearing gloves.
Tape used to bind his wrists was stolen
from the hospital supply closet. That is it.
If Jacques has any secrets, he'll be taking them underground.
What about the mill? Well, preliminary suggests arson.
I nominate Leo Johnson.
We'll have to get a statement from Shelly Johnson.
Hospital says she's well enough.
How do you feel?
Me? I believe it's customary to ask
after the health of one recently plugged three times.
Thanks for asking.
Don't get sentimental. Who shot me, Albert?
My men are interrogating the hotel guests,
the usual bumper crop of rural know-nothings
and drunken fly fishermen. Nothing so far.
The world's most decrepit room-service waiter
remembers nothing out of the ordinary about the night.
No surprise there.
Señor Droolcup has, shall we say, a mind that wanders.
Albert, my ring is gone.
One day here, the next day gone.
So?
I'm glad you're with us, Albert. We need the very best.
Dedication to duty wasn't the only thing that brought me back here, Cooper.
What else? Windom Earle.
Agent Earle?
He's retired.
To a nice comfy chair complete with wrist restraints
at the local laughing academy.
What happened?
Nobody knows.
Your former partner flew the coop, Coop.
He escaped. Vanished into thin air.
That's not good.
Hello?
Mrs. Tremond? It's Meals on Wheels.
Hello?
Enter.
Mrs. Tremond?
Can I put your meal here?
Yes, that's fine.
Miss?
Oh, hi.
Sometimes things can happen just like this:
Creamed corn.
Do you see creamed corn on that plate?
Yes.
I requested no creamed corn.
Do you see creamed corn on that plate?
No.
My grandson is studying magic.
That's nice.
Who are you?
I'm taking over Laura Palmer's place on the Meals on Wheels.
She's dead.
Did you know her well?
No.
Okay, Mrs. Tremond.
I'll be back tomorrow to pick this up and to bring your lunch.
They used to bring me hospital food.
Imagine that.
Young lady?
You might ask Mr. Smith next door.
He was Laura's friend.
Mr. Smith does not leave his house.
Hello?
She seemed like a very nice girl.
Thanks, Harry.
Ronette?
I can't get this thing to work.
Excuse us, Ronette.
"Stop.
Read operating instructions beneath seat before using.
Stand next to chair or stool.
Do not remain seated.
Place foot on base
and pull seat all the way up
until you hear a click."
Sorry, Ronette.
Ronette,
can you hear me?
Okay.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
I don't want to upset you, but we need your help.
I'm gonna show you some sketches.
We need to know if you've seen these men before.
We need to know if these are the men that hurt you, okay?
Do you recognize this man?
Is this the man that hurt you?
Mm.
Ronette.
Train. Train.
Ronette? Tr... Train, train.
Nurse. Right away. Train?
Train? Tra...
Are you in the train car? Train car?
Train, train, train!
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Train!
Okay, okay. Stay calm.
Train, train.
Brother Ben, we've got two ledgers
and one smoked cheese pig.
Which one do we burn?
And it ain't gonna be my pig.
The real ledger shows the mill slowly sinking into bankruptcy,
masterminded by Catherine.
The one she faked, for public consumption,
shows the mill turning a healthy profit.
So which one do we burn?
Catherine's dead,
we put all of our money on Josie,
Catherine takes the fall for the fire,
Josie pockets the insurance money,
sells us the mill and the land and... No, wait a minute.
First she has to get dear Pete to sign on the dotted line.
Why does Pete have to sign?
Andrew's will calls for Catherine or her heirs to approve of any sale.
So which one do we burn?
Once Josie sells us the mill,
we could get a better price if it appears to be more profitable.
So we burn the real one.
On the other hand,
the real one would hold up under any future scrutiny.
Depending upon how one looks at the situation, it appears
they both have merit.
I know.
Maybe we should burn both of them.
It looks like we are 100 percent certain that we're not sure.
Jer, obviously something requires burning.
And since we don't wanna set fire to your smoked cheese pig,
why don't we, uh,
try these?
Marshmallows!
Ben, where are those hickory sticks?
Margaret, it's always very nice to see you.
But if you're gonna spit your sticky pitch gum out in the diner,
please use an ashtray
and not the counter or the booth like you did last time?
I'll have a bear claw.
You wear shiny objects on your chest.
Yes, I do.
Are you proud?
No, achievement is its own reward. Pride obscures it.
Cream?
My log has something to tell you.
Do you know it?
I don't believe we've been introduced.
I do not introduce the log.
Can you hear it?
No, ma'am, I cannot.
I will translate.
Deliver the message.
Do you understand?
Yes, ma'am. As a matter of fact, I do.
No messages, Deputy Brennan.
Listen to me, Lucy Moran. You just listen.
When the Tacoma Sperm Bank was looking for donors,
naturally, I applied.
It's my civic duty, and I like whales.
A routine physical examination revealed that I'm sterile.
Sure, I thought it meant I didn't have to take a bath,
but the doctors told me the truth.
They told me I can't have babies.
So, what I wanna know now is why are you having one and how?
Hello, Hank.
I bet Lucy asked you to wait outside, huh?
Might've.
You know, that's an awfully cute buck, Harry.
Let's not waste our time.
Okay.
Why don't you
just sign in like a good boy?
Keep your nose clean for another week.
It's really nice to see you again.
Interesting piece of work.
How long were you and Hank friends?
We grew up together.
Hank used to be a Bookhouse Boy.
Back then,
Hank was one of the best of us.
Sheriff Truman,
I have Ben Horne on the phone for you.
Would you like me to transfer him to you?
Well, not him but his phone call?
Put him on, Lucy.
Mr. Horne, this is Lucy.
I'm gonna transfer you now into Sheriff Truman's office.
He's in there with Special Agent Dale Cooper.
Okay, so hold on.
Sheriff Truman, I've transferred Ben Horne to you.
It's the line with the light that's blinking.
Yes, Ben. Harry,
Audrey's missing.
What? For as much as, uh, maybe two days.
You hold on.
Audrey Horne is missing.
One insurance policy, unsigned.
"Un"?
The agent said that Catherine was concerned
about certain irregularities,
such as Josie being named the chief beneficiary.
Agent wasn't supposed to show it to her.
Well, considering Catherine's smoky fate,
for our side, it's all for the best.
Well. Win a few, lose a few.
Let's get those pickled icemen on the blower.
Gentlemen, I've been giving this a lot of thought.
This mill fire will put contract signing on hold for the moment,
so we must ensure that the moment, our moment, does not pass us by.
I therefore recommend we make a quick
but cordial follow-up phone call to Iceland,
a little gentle handling,
let Einar know that we're right on top of this thing.
We can handle that.
Ben Horne for Einar Thorson.
Oh. Now, this is a coincidence.
Einar.
What's that?
Where did you hear about it?
Mr. Palmer called to tell you about the fire?
No, no, I wouldn't call it a disaster at all.
It's just one of those things, an unfortunate development.
But I assure you, Einar,
that it in no way will affect our development plans.
Jerry Horne here, Einar.
Full speed ahead.
Yes, yes, of course, Einar.
We will fax all pertinent details to you.
Yes, yes, I promise.
Listen, I don't want you to worry your attractive blond head about this.
Einar, I'm in a meeting. Gotta go.
Leland?
Leland, here's an idea.
Let's take you off of damage control,
let you concentrate on something that you can handle.
Like my tax return.
I know him.
Excuse me?
My grandfather's summer house on Pearl Lakes.
He lived right next door.
I was just a little boy.
But I know him.
I've gotta tell the sheriff about this right away.
Jerry,
please kill Leland.
Is this real, Ben,
or some strange and twisted dream?
The bullet lodged in Leo's spine...
It's all right, Shelly, come on.
The bullet lodged in his spine, but we removed it successfully.
As for possible paralysis, it's too early to tell.
Leo lost a lot of blood,
most of it before we had a chance to operate.
I fear the resulting oxygen deprivation starved his brain,
induced the coma you see here.
Is he a vegetable?
Is he in pain?
He's not in pain.
Beyond that, it's hard to say.
Can you make him better?
We can maintain his current state.
Offer nutrition, life-support.
Beyond that, the only ally we have is time.
I'm sorry, Shelly.
Me too.
Are they gonna put him in prison?
I know he's a suspect in several felonies.
I guess at the moment he's kind of in prison anyway.
Yes, he is.
Come on, I'll take you back to your room.
Norma's waiting downstairs to drive you home.
Hello, Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station.
Who may I say is calling, please?
I'm sorry, I can't connect you with Sheriff Truman
unless you tell me what your name is.
You won't?
I'm sorry, but I can't connect you with Sheriff Truman
unless you tell me who you are.
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm going to have to hang up now.
Hey, I'll take it from here.
No. No, you won't.
No, it's okay.
Okay, but watch out for this one.
Okay.
Why is the vacuum cleaner off?
Look at those toes.
What toes?
I brought the ice.
Frosty? My little snowman.
I feel a cold front moving in.
Mm.
Hi, Emory. You remember me? Huh?
It really looks like you got yourself in a fix here, huh?
Well, guess what.
I'm gonna tell you a nice little bedtime story. Are you ready?
Once upon a time there was a sweet, innocent girl named Red...
That's me.
And she met a bad old wolf... That's you.
And she kicked the crap out of that wolf and she told her daddy all about it.
Then she told the police,
and the bad old wolf went to jail for a million years.
What do you want? I wanna know everything you know.
Perfume counter, Laura Palmer, Ronette Pulaski and One-Eyed Jack's.
You're insane.
Heh. I'm insane?
Well, I'm Audrey Horne and I get what I want.
Understand? Yes, all right.
I work for the owner of One-Eyed Jack's.
Who is? I work for the owner
of One-Eyed Jack's. Who is?
Your father.
He owns it all. Hell, he owns everything.
I run girls through the perfume counter.
I recruited Ronette and Laura.
Did Laura come here? One weekend.
She was using drugs.
We threw her out. I never saw her again, I swear.
Did my father know that Laura was here?
Yes, yes, he did.
Mr. Horne makes it his business to entertain all the girls.
Did she know he owned this place?
Owned what?
One-Eyed Jack's! Yes! Yes. Probably she did.
Laura always got her way.
Understand?
Just like you.
Why don't you change the station?
That's good.
Yeah.
I made the call.
Told them I was Leo's cousin.
Leo gets his disability
as long as he stays out of prison. It's a lot of money, Shelly.
Over 5,000 a month.
But you only get it if he stays at home.
I don't care about the money. I don't want Leo home.
Leo is in dreamland.
You can stick him in the corner and hang doughnuts from his ears.
Sheriff Truman wants me to make a statement.
No way. Look, they can't force you to testify against your husband.
All you gotta do is get Leo home,
sit and collect the checks.
Leo owes you, baby.
Now we can really make him pay.
You want something nice? We can buy it.
You want to go someplace special, sit in the sun?
It's on Leo. Understand?
I guess it would be nice not to have to worry about money.
I have a lot of bills I have to pay.
Bills? Forget about bills. I'm talking about a new way of life.
Together?
What do you think?
I think I wanna get comfortable.
That's why I got my dad's Continental.
Mm.
Bobby Briggs, I'm gonna eat you up.
Promise?
Just watch me.
Diane, I received some very bad news today.
Windom Earle has vanished.
The disappearance of my former partner
is extremely troubling.
I also learned that Audrey Horne is missing.
Audrey's absence touches me in ways I could not predict.
I find myself thinking not of clues or of evidence
but of the content of her smile.
Who is it?
It's Major Briggs, Agent Cooper.
Just a moment.
Major. May I come in?
Please.
I have a message for you.
From whom?
I'm not at liberty to reveal the nature of my work.
This secrecy pains me from time to time.
Any bureaucracy that functions in secret
inevitably lends itself to corruption.
But these rules I have pledged to uphold.
I believe a pledge is sacred.
Speaking as a man
and a fellow employee of the federal government, so do I.
Well, I may reveal this much:
Among my many tasks
is the maintenance of deep-space monitors
aimed at galaxies beyond our own.
We routinely receive various communications,
space garbage, to decode and examine.
They look something like this.
It's radio waves and gibberish, Agent Cooper.
Till Thursday night.
Friday morning, to be exact.
Around the time that I was shot.
The readout took us by surprise.
Row after row of gibberish.
And all of a sudden...
"The owls are not what they seem."
Why did you bring this to me?
Because later in the morning...
"Cooper,
Cooper. Cooper."
My God.
That was really good. Let's try it again.
Just you and I
Just you and I
Together
Forever
In love
Just you
Just you
And I BOTH: And I
Just you MADDY & DONNA: Just you
And I
And I
Together
Forever
In love
In love
We go strolling together
In love
We go strolling forever
Oh
Just you BOTH: Just you
And I BOTH: And I
Just you and I
And I
Together
Forever
In love
Just you
And I
Just you
And I
Just you
And I
Just you
And I
Just you
Donna.
Donna, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Donna?
Donna, what's going on?
I'm trembling, James.
You made me.
Donna.
Donna?
Yes?
There's a telephone call for you from a Harold Smith.
Oh, okay. I'll get it in the hallway.
Okay, Dad. I got it.
Okay, sweetheart.
Hello?
Mr. Smith?
I received yours.
I wanted to talk to you.
We can meet?
Okay.
The owls are not what they seem.
The owls are not what they seem.
Laura!
Laura!
Agent Cooper.
It's me, Audrey. Audrey?
Where are you?
Why aren't you here?
Audrey, this is no time for schoolgirl games.
I want you home now.
I saw you in your tuxedo.
You look like a movie star.
Audrey, if you're in any kind of trouble...
I am in trouble, but I'm gonna come home now.
Audrey? Audrey?
Trouble, Miss Horne?
You don't know what trouble is.
Not by a long shot.
﻿1
Get her arms. I got this side.
Miss Pulaski?
Cover her arms. Miss Pulaski, calm down now.
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.
Get her legs. I got it. Hang on.
Miss Pulaski, just calm down, please.
You're all right. Give her a sedative.
No! No!
Ronette pulled out her IV. I just gave her a sedative.
Looks like dye.
Harry, give me a hand. What's this?
A little chloride. Spray her finger.
Albert, get your microscope.
All right.
All right, Ronette. Breathe, now, honey.
He's been here. We have a 24-hour guard.
Harry, he did this.
And he tainted the IV.
Maybe she saw him.
Maybe she heard a Sousa march and got up to look for her baton.
I'll do a workup on the IV.
That's our man.
Those letters were never made public.
Fellas,
let's stand together for a moment.
It's time I mentioned something.
Now, I'm not sure,
but I believe I was visited by a giant.
Twice.
In my room.
He left me three clues.
The first had to do with Jacques Renault in a body bag.
It came true almost immediately.
The second was, "The owls are not what they seem."
The third was about a man who points without chemicals.
You were visited by a giant?
Any relation to the dwarf?
You're wearing a different sweater than yesterday.
Color's better on you.
I forgot my manners.
I'm Harold Smith.
I guess you know who I am.
Please come in.
Would you like some lemonade?
I also have some saltines and some apple butter.
Or would you like to wash your hands?
No, thanks.
I insist.
It's very warm in here.
Don't be nervous, Donna. I'm not nervous.
I'm curious.
Curious about my relationship with Laura.
Why did you send me that letter?
Laura wanted me to get in touch with you if anything ever happened to her.
Why?
She said you'd ask a lot of questions.
How long did you know Laura?
Ever since she began Meals on Wheels.
I was her best customer.
You don't seem much like a shut-in.
You mean, politely, what's the matter with me?
Okay.
I don't like to go outside.
I, uh...
...can't.
Do you have a judgment you'd like to express?
No.
Laura said you were very fair-minded.
If you knew her so well, why didn't she ever mention you to me?
Well, Laura liked to think of me...
...as a mystery in her life.
Then why did you call me?
I am...
Well, I used to be a horticulturist.
I raise orchids.
That's why it's so warm in here.
They don't need a lot of light.
I wrote to you because I wondered
if you'd be kind enough to place one of them on her grave.
Of course.
Will you excuse me a moment? Sure.
This is a hybrid.
A lady's slipper.
It's very beautiful. Mm.
Take it, please. My last gift to Laura.
That's very kind of you, Mr. Smith.
Harold.
She was very kind to me.
Forgive me, but I know so much about you, you see.
What?
You're every bit as lovely as Laura said you were.
I'll be back.
I'll be here.
R, B, T.
Harry, I believe that these letters and the Giant's clues
are in some way related to this long-haired man.
Mrs. Palmer saw him in a vision.
She called this morning to say that Maddy
had seen the man twice in the past two days,
both times in a vision.
I've seen him in my dream.
And Ronette.
Saw him physically at the train car. Right.
Four of us have seen him in different forms.
This path is a psychic link that will lead us straight to him.
So, what did this giant sound like? Hmm?
I mean, did he have a big, booming voice or what?
No, no. He spoke softly, distinctly. And you gave him the beans
you were supposed to use to buy a cow?
No, Albert, I gave him my ring.
Okay,
confining my conclusions to the planet Earth,
the cocaine you found in James Hurley's gas tank
was a match to what we found in Jacques' car
and Leo's house. Get the picture?
Even got the frame.
Handiwork of Leo Johnson,
currently appearing at Calhoun Memorial Hospital as Mr. Potato Head.
The boots are a Circle Brand rare work boot.
Ones we found haven't been worn or tampered with.
The letter B from Ronette's finger
was cut from a copy of Flesh World. It's a perfect match.
This particular edition features swingers' clubs
for standard poodle enthusiasts.
No comment.
We sent a portrait of your long-haired man
to every agency from NASA to DEA and came up empty.
This cat is in nobody's database.
A man that four of us have seen here in Twin Peaks.
Sure.
Oh, by the way, you were shot with a Walther PPK.
It's James Bond's gun, did you know that?
You're looking better today, Coop.
Thank you, Albert. Feeling better.
The trail of the man who shot you is ice-cold,
but I hoovered some fibers from the corridor outside your room.
My ticket out of Trolleyville.
I'll be at the lab, gentlemen.
Anything we should be working on? Yeah.
You might practice walking without dragging your knuckles on the floor.
Albert, let's talk about knuckles.
Now, the last time, I knocked you down.
I felt bad about it. The next time's gonna be a real pleasure.
You listen to me.
While I will admit to a certain cynicism,
the fact is that I'm a naysayer and hatchet man
in the fight against violence.
I pride myself in taking a punch
and I'll gladly take another
because I choose to live my life in the company of Gandhi and King.
My concerns are global.
I reject absolutely revenge, aggression and retaliation.
The foundation of such a method...
...is love.
I love you, Sheriff Truman.
Albert's path is a strange and difficult one.
Deputy.
James, you're not gonna be charged.
The cocaine we found in your bike was planted.
I was trying to tell you that when... James,
I don't wanna see you down here again.
Yes, sir.
Stop trying to figure it all out yourself.
Find someone to talk to. Talk to me.
Go on home, James.
How's it going, Lucy?
Seventy-five words.
Oh, wait a minute, 76.
Seventy-seven. Good work, Lucy.
That's 78.
Agent Cooper asked me to find as many words as I could
that contain the letters B, T and R.
Let me see. I used to be pretty good at this.
My lunch date is here.
This is the date that made Andy call in sick?
Hi, Lucy.
There you are.
Hello, Dick.
Lucy, I've always considered you to be a woman of letters.
"Prohibited."
I say, I don't believe we've met.
Richard Tremayne.
Horne's Department Store.
Designer Menswear.
Robot.
Did I do something to anger him?
Not that native people don't have enough reason to be angry, per se.
Let's go to lunch. Capital.
We'll go Dutch.
So how tall was this guy? Did his head hit the ceiling?
Almost. Whew.
I believe that the ceilings in The Great Northern are at least 10 feet tall.
At least.
I'm sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting.
That's okay, Leland. What's on your mind?
This man.
I know him.
How do you know him, Leland?
When I was a little boy,
my grandfather had a summer home up on Pearl Lakes.
We used to go there every year.
You knew him from there? Yes. Yes.
Now, I know that he wasn't a Chelbert.
They were our neighbors that lived on one side.
On the other side there was a vacant lot.
Next to that was a white house.
That's where he lived.
Do you remember a name?
No.
I think...
I think it was Robertson. Robertson.
Robertson.
Robert. R, T, B. That's what the letters are trying to spell.
Hawk, get up to Pearl Lakes, find out who used to live in that white house.
I'll do what I can.
Leland, thank you.
That's valuable information. Thanks. Thank you, Leland.
Oh... Something else.
He used to flick matches at me.
He'd say:
"You wanna play with fire, little boy?"
That's our man.
Of course, most of the time I keep my department running like a top,
but Christmas... Well, that was such a madhouse.
Was absolutely no time for paperwork.
I simply had to develop a system to memorize customer orders
using mnemonic triggers.
For instance, someone looking for argyle socks?
Well, that would file under A for "argyle," subheading S for "socks."
Now, it does get tricky.
A request for a vulcanized mackintosh, for instance...
Now, does that file under R for "raingear,"
or W for "waterproof"?
My familiarity with the inventory finds me leaning towards an R.
Lucy, may I ask you something?
Do you find it odd that I don't switch my fork when I eat,
that I lift it to my mouth with my left hand?
My mother calls it piling.
Actually, it's not odd at all.
It's the European way.
It's been six weeks, Dick. You said you were gonna call.
I know.
I lost your phone number.
I work for the sheriff. You could've dialed 911.
Lucy, I do apologize. I've been so terribly busy, honestly.
I've hardly had time to feed my cat. Ha-ha-ha.
We went out every Thursday night for three months.
You made promises to me. You said you were gonna take me to dinner
at the Space Needle in Seattle.
Even though you took me to Family Night at the Pancake Plantation,
I still couldn't help but think that it meant something special.
When in fact the only thing special we did that night
was drink two bottles of champagne
and end up on a display bed in Horne's Home Furnishings!
I admit it was daring. That made it exciting.
Still, I thought it would lead to more. Like a phone call.
Lucy, I feel terrible you're upset. Really I do.
Let me make it up to you. Like how, for instance?
For starters,
I know I promised you a new dress at my 20 percent employee discount.
After lunch, I'll go right back
and arrange something with Ms. Bolbo in women's wear. Very special indeed.
Oh, yeah?
How about a maternity dress!
Pardon?
I'm pregnant, Richard.
Pregnant.
Preggers? Hmm.
Does Donna seem different to you?
What do you mean?
Well, like, doesn't her smoking and stuff bother you?
She's trying to act, like, all tough all of a sudden.
James, you know her better than I do.
Yeah.
She came to visit when I was in jail and...
I don't know.
What?
Well,
she acted like she wanted
to do it with me through the bars.
She didn't even care if anybody was around.
I don't know.
It was weird.
It wasn't like her.
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.
Sometimes I think I should just get on my bike and go.
James.
Running away won't solve anything.
It's gonna be okay.
Donna, where you been? You're late.
I met someone from Meals on Wheels.
Those old folks must have some pretty cool stories.
This was a young man.
Really? What's wrong with him?
You know, it's hard to say.
Other than he was bright and charming, intelligent.
Completely unlike anybody I know.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why don't you sit here and hold hands and try to figure it out.
That's good, Emory.
She's ready for her close-up now.
We should get rid of her.
She knows I sent Laura up here, she knows her father owns the place.
With what Ben Horne will pay to get his funked-up little daughter back,
I'll buy the bastard out.
Look, I don't wanna lose my job.
Honey, if this doesn't work, you'll lose a lot more than your job.
We can't handle this alone. Ben Horne is dangerous.
Now, listen, you spineless gasbag, you are in this up to your shiny pate.
Now, stop whining.
You do as I tell you, and we'll have all the help we need.
Look at her.
Riding the white tiger.
In a few days she won't wanna come down.
Just like her daddy did to me.
Now, these babies are just perfect.
For heavy field work, and they're extremely versatile.
Durable, with a steel reinforced toe. Not quite right.
Now, if the department does any parading,
on the Fourth or Veterans Day, these are your best bet.
Nice, huh? Yeah.
Add some silver-trimmed laces, it's a real eye-catcher.
I can see that. But a little outside my budget, Mr. Gerard.
I understand completely.
You need something more practical. Yep.
A shoe for all seasons.
Now, this is more like it.
Yeah. Jim-dandy.
Oh. Very popular.
The lovely thing about...
Mr. Gerard?
Mr. Gerard, you okay?
Oh. I'm sorry.
Sometimes I get a bit disoriented.
Can I get you something? Water?
If there's a bathroom, I have a medication.
Sure. It's right down the hall. This way.
Thanks for coming down, Shelly.
Sheriff, I'm just gonna say this:
I know I don't have to, so I'm not gonna say anything against Leo.
We're not asking you to.
He's my husband. I don't have to testify against my husband.
Well, you're not testifying. You're just giving us a statement.
Doc Hayward says he's too sick.
What difference does it make?
The difference, Shelly, is there's some people injured
and there's some people dead.
Now, we know Leo started that fire.
And we know you were there.
I'm not gonna say anything against him.
I love him.
Okay, Shelly, that's fine.
Thanks for coming in. What?
Oh, I think Shelly's thought long and hard about this.
Maybe someday, with a little luck and some topflight medical attention,
you'll have Leo back.
The same old Leo that you obviously still love.
Maybe then he'll realize what a wonderful person he's married to.
What?
Thanks again, Shelly.
Best of luck.
What's going on?
Smells like insurance money.
Shelly didn't dream this up herself.
So who do you think is pulling the strings?
Harry,
that's a damn good question.
Bob...
...I know you're near.
I'm after you now.
Mr. Horne? Tsk tsk. Gotta go, Jerry.
Mr. Horne, have you heard anything from your daughter?
Not since I spoke to Sheriff Truman yesterday.
She phoned me last night.
From where? She didn't say.
She referenced seeing me in my tuxedo.
Now, I was wearing a tux here at the hotel the night that I was shot.
Well, like I told you, Audrey's gone missing before
on a semi-regular basis.
So have two other local girls recently.
Mr. Horne, speaking frankly, is there trouble at home?
Mr. Cooper,
do I detect a note of something outside the scope of professional concern?
Audrey and I have struck up an acquaintance.
Acquaintance.
Agent Cooper.
Let me give you the best advice that you're gonna get all week:
Men fall under the spell of Audrey's charms
like ducks in a shooting gallery.
And if you don't want a load of buckshot in your tail feathers,
may I suggest that you park your jalopy outside of somebody else's window.
Mr. Horne, if I've overstepped my bounds with my concern, I apologize.
I am here with only the best intentions.
That is achingly clear.
And not unappreciated.
I'll put a lamp in the window,
you'll be my first call when she comes home to roost.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
Welcome back.
Where am I?
I brought you something.
Open wide.
English caramels.
Sugar's what you need.
Please... Go slow, baby.
Candy's dandy, huh?
Plenty more where that came from.
My name is Jean.
Sweet sleep.
Feel the warmth.
That's the man.
Oh, my God.
You know him? FBI.
He's FBI. I saw him at the town meeting after Laura died.
He was up here?
I want him.
Jean Renault. Emory,
say something weak and fawning.
Jacques was your brother?
And this is my sister. Nancy?
I also had a brother, Bernard.
This business cost me them both.
I told you we'd have help.
I'm your go-between.
The father pays me, my cut is 30 percent.
The father never know who snatch his baby.
And I get the man who kill my brother.
What's his name?
Cooper. Cooper.
And all you have to do is bring him to me.
Mr. Horne can maybe do that.
But you're going to be a big help, aren't you?
Whatever you want... Want me to do.
The tape of the girl. Get it now.
Yes, all right.
She goes back north,
or this deal goes south. Jean, tell my sister to behave herself,
or you'll get mad.
She stays.
You get the money, I get Cooper. Everybody happy.
Of course, we...
We can't let the girl live now,
can we?
No, no, no. Thanks, Pete. I appreciate the call.
Harry?
Time for a break.
Josie called Pete. She'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
Great. Let's bring her in.
Coop, I need a favor.
I'd like to see her first. Alone.
Harry, we can't let personal feelings interfere with our work.
Easier said than done.
Talk to her. Bring her in.
You know there's a chance that she's not involved with any of this.
Harry, you have my blessing.
Pearl Lakes. There's a vacant lot next to the Palmer house.
Next to that there's a white house all boarded up.
Mailbox, no name on it. Title check?
County's working on it. Power and Lights are searching their records.
How soon before we know? Morning, earliest.
Hawk, you haven't seen Mr. Gerard, have you?
Shoe salesman? The one-armed man?
He came in to show me some samples.
The one-armed man was here?
Yeah, he got faint and had to go to the bathroom.
Never came back.
Harry, remember in my dream? The one-armed man knew Bob.
What's going on?
"Without chemicals, he points."
The Giant's third clue.
Harry, we've got to find the one-armed man.
Is that really necessary, doc?
It's for her own protection, Ed.
She ripped two pair of leather restraints last night
like tissue paper. I ran a blood test.
She's pumping out more adrenaline than a wildcat well.
Never seen anything like it.
Now, your being here may quiet her.
Talk to her. Maybe sing. She got a favorite song?
Favorite song?
Beats a trip to Lourdes.
Okay.
But if I'm gonna sing to her, doc, I'd rather it was just the two of us.
I'll close the door behind me.
Nadine?
Doc says I should sing a song for you.
I'm sorry, honey. I'm not sure what you'd like to hear.
On top of Old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
A-courtin' too slow
Courting's a pleasure
Parting's a grief
A false-hearted lover
Is worse than a thief
Good God.
You're a jack and I'm a jack And Steeplejacks are we
And when we climb up to the top
The cry is victory!
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y!
Vi...
Hi, Eddie.
Did you come by to pick me up?
Uh-huh.
Doc Hayward says tonsillitis or no tonsillitis,
I can go to cheerleading tryouts.
Cheerleader tryouts?
Well, I'm a senior, Eddie.
You know what they say. Heh.
You're only 18 once.
Dr. Jacoby?
Gents. Come on in.
This is my wife, Eolani.
She lives at our place in Hanalei.
We're... Well, we're practicing a kind of creative kahuna healing.
How do you do? Ma'am.
Are you ready to be hypnotized?
Oh. Yes, yes. I've been under many times.
This is the autosuggestion program that I use.
Eolani, start the tape, please.
Sheriff Truman.
Would you hold this stone, please, at the end of the bed there?
Great. Just...
Yes. Whoa.
Okay, Agent Cooper. I'm ready.
"You are standing on a smooth, green carpet of grass.
The ball is 15 feet from the hole.
Beyond the green, two pristine white sand traps
and a lily-filled pond yawn out towards the emerald fairway.
The hole seems to slowly drift away across the green
towards the pond, carried by the summer wind.
The green grows larger and larger.
The green engulfs you,
enveloping you in a soft blanket of peace.
Harry.
You stroke the ball.
It drifts towards the hole and gently drops in its center."
Can you hear me, Dr. Jacoby?
Yes.
You're in your hospital room. In the room is Jacques Renault.
Do you smell anything? Burned engine oil?
I smell engine oil at the park.
Air is filled with it.
All right, we're going back to your room at the hospital now.
Does anyone come into the room?
Nurses,
Doc Hayward.
You, Sheriff Truman.
What happens after we leave?
I dream I'm at Hanauma Bay.
I'm juggling coconuts at a luau.
The guests are all Nigerians.
All right.
Does anyone else come into the room, later that night?
The sound of the tape ripping wakes me up.
I see a pillow going over his face.
He's making this sound.
Almost like a dog barking.
Jacques stops moving.
I look up to see who's holding the pillow.
Who is it?
Do you see who it is?
I know him.
Hi.
This is from Harold Smith.
Sorry I haven't been out to see you since the funeral,
but things have been pretty strange.
So were you sleeping with this guy Harold or what?
He seems pretty nice.
Kind of an oddball.
Although, I guess anyone can start to seem like that
when you look close enough.
We need to talk.
Maybe you already know about me and James.
But anyway, after you died, we kind of got together.
This isn't something I feel like I have to explain to you
because you probably knew how we felt before we did.
How can you be so smart about things like that...
...and so stupid about so much else?
I'm mad at you.
When it was you and me and James, it kind of worked.
Now you're gone.
I love James.
And it's a mess.
Your cousin Maddy's here,
and I think there's something going on between the two of them.
And I'm afraid I'm gonna end up losing both of you.
I wanted so much to be like you, Laura.
To have your strength and your courage.
But look what it did.
Look what it did to you.
As much as I love you, Laura,
most of the time we were trying to solve your problems.
And you know what? We still are.
Not mine or James' or Maddy's. Yours.
You're dead, Laura, but your problems keep hanging around.
It's almost like they didn't bury you deep enough!
James.
I'm looking for Donna. I can't find her.
I just gotta talk to somebody.
What's wrong, James?
She came home.
Who?
My mom was all loaded. She was all screwed up.
God, I hate her.
James, no.
God, you're on fire.
Hold me.
Oh, my God.
Donna.
Donna!
Why?!
All I did was come to a funeral.
And it's like I fell into a dream.
It's like people think
I'm Laura.
And I'm not.
I'm nothing like Laura. It's so hard, I know.
I know, sweetheart. I know.
All I know is that Laura was my cousin,
and I loved her and she died.
I don't know anything else.
You just want life to be the way it was before.
Yeah. So do I.
We all do.
And try as we might, it just won't cooperate, will it?
No.
Oh, baby.
If life could only be like those summers up at...
...Pearl Lakes.
Leland?
The door was open.
Leland...
What is it?
Leland, you're under arrest for the murder of Jacques Renault.
I'm sorry, I didn't know where else to go.
Donna. What's wrong?
I don't even know if I want to talk about it, I feel so stupid.
Slow down.
Sit down.
I keep telling myself that he's confused,
but how much longer am I supposed to think that?
James Hurley? Yeah.
Just when I thought I had it all figured out.
Why do I even care? Why should I?
Well, you care because you care for him.
Don't you? I wish I didn't. I just want it to stop.
First, you have to stop.
Hey, what was it she used to say?
"Donna Madonna, there's always mañana."
How did you know that?
I'll get you something to drink, okay? Okay.
﻿1
Daddy.
Daddy.
Leland.
Daddy.
Leland.
Daddy. Daddy. Leland.
Leland.
Leland.
Yeah.
You have the right to an attorney.
I waive that right.
I'm gonna ask you some questions.
Anything you say may be held against you in a court of law.
Do you understand?
Yes, of course, I do.
On Friday morning, March 3rd,
did you go to Calhoun Memorial Hospital?
Yes.
Why did you go there?
I was looking for someone.
Who were you looking for?
The man who killed my daughter.
Did you know his name?
No.
Yes. I do now.
Jacques Renault.
What made you think he killed Laura?
You arrested him.
Leland...
...did you kill Jacques Renault?
He killed my Laura.
Have you ever experienced
absolute loss?
I doubt that any one of us is a stranger to grief.
No, more than grief.
It's deep down.
Inside.
Every cell screams.
You can hear...
...nothing else.
Yes.
I ki...
I killed him.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes.
He'll plead temporary insanity.
We'll need a psychiatric exam.
I'll tell you one thing, parents should not bury their children.
Anyone who's been through what Leland has is...
Do you approve of murder, Dr. Hayward?
No.
Hey, doc.
How are you, Andy? Fine.
Great. Fine.
What's the problem?
It's kind of personal.
I'm your doctor, Andy.
It's about my sperms test.
Yes?
You know, I flunked.
That's not the precise term for it.
Well, I was just wondering
if it's the kind of test you can take over.
You know, like a driver's exam.
I mean, I've been wearing boxer shorts every day just like you told me.
You wanna give it another shot?
Yes, sir. I would.
I'll need to take a sample with me.
Right now? Put it in a brown bag.
I'll wait in the car.
Hmp!
Lucy, I've got a garbage truck here on...
Oh, shut up.
Our judge arrives this afternoon.
Clinton Sternwood.
Travels the circuit in a Winnebago.
Outdoors enthusiast?
Last of the frontiersmen.
They broke the mold.
I only got bail hearing for Leland and Leo's competency examination.
Will Leland get bail?
Well, Harry, that's up to your state prosecutor.
That'd be Daryl Lodwick.
Also on his way.
When do we hear from Hawk?
He called this morning.
Now, the county...
...says nobody by the name of Robertson
had ever lived next to the Palmers.
We got a current address on the last occupants.
Kalispell. We'll check it by afternoon.
Hey. Watch it, Andy. Sorry, Bob.
Oh, my God.
Andy, don't move.
Where did you get those? Don't make me say
where these came from.
Andy?
Please, Agent Cooper, this is extremely personal business.
Your boots?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I bought these from Phillip Gerard yesterday when he was waiting. Sorry.
These are the same brand of boots we found at Leo Johnson's.
The Giant said there was a clue out there.
I thought it was the cocaine?
Harry, we've gotta find Phillip Gerard, the one-armed man.
Can I go now, Agent Cooper?
I don't know how much time I've got.
If you must.
Harry, what's with Lucy?
Mr. Horne. Walk and talk.
This friend of mine works with the Seattle Post-Dispatch.
Actually, my sister went to college with her but she's a friend of mine too.
Anyway, she called me this morning with a hot tip. Top secret.
M.T. Wentz is coming to Twin Peaks.
M.T. Wentz. M.T. Wentz.
M.T. Wentz, the travel writer.
Yes, M.T. Wentz the travel writer.
Wentz travels incognito, uses only cash, no credit cards.
Nobody can trace his identity.
Or hers. No one at the paper even knows who he or she is.
Favorable Wentz review could be quite useful.
Well, he's coming. He's coming, he's coming.
Keep an eye on the registration. I want an hourly update.
Scrutinize every check. Especially if they pay cash.
Not even 9:30 and you have already done a good day's work.
Oh. Ha-ha. Whoo.
Mr. Horne.
You look well.
What can I do for you? Oh, we've met.
I sell insurance to the small business.
Like One-Eyed Jack.
Jean Renault.
What's the occasion?
Are my premiums about to be raised?
No, no. Nothing like that.
Please.
You bastard.
You bastard! Make no mistake, Mr. Horne.
I'm just the messenger.
From whom?
They request a large sum of money.
How much? I require something else entirely.
They should bear the cost of their own middleman.
Ah.
Number one.
Your business up there
is being run by pickpockets and fools.
A dollar earned is a dollar stolen.
Are you aware of that?
I have my suspicions.
What you need is a partner.
Someone who can take care of these little problems.
I have a partner. Okay.
Do you want my help or no?
Yes.
One more thing.
I want this man to bring to me the ransom.
This man is an FBI agent.
Do you want your daughter back?
Of course, I want my daughter back
but I can't... Shh.
Cash...
...partner...
...FBI man.
This is supposed to be an equitable exchange.
This could turn out well.
Huh?
Expect a call tomorrow...
...noon.
Janet. Ahem.
Find Agent Cooper for me. It's urgent.
You're kidding?
What's he look like?
Well, you're looking real pretty today, Donna.
Thanks. Special occasion?
Yeah. I'm having lunch today with someone I met on my route.
Bedpans and shut-ins. Who's to meet?
You wouldn't understand.
Don't spill the soup. Thanks, Louie.
Hey, listen to this.
I just got a call from Louie at the Northern.
M.T. Wentz is coming to Twin Peaks.
Empty who?
Hank, he's the most powerful restaurant critic in the state.
Really? Yeah.
And a good review from him and his Seattle paper
could give us a lot of business.
So she's gonna try to send him our way.
What's he look like?
Well, nobody knows. I guess it's a secret.
But he's supposed to be arriving today.
Then we still got time.
Time for what, Hank?
I'm gonna pick up some flowers
and maybe some candles and some tablecloths.
And what can we add to the menu? Some specials maybe.
I always wanted to try some regional dishes.
Mm! Babe, we're gonna trick this place out
like Christmas on the Fourth of July.
Oh, and I think you should give Big Ed a call.
Why? Well...
...you're still friendly, right?
So maybe this Wentz guy stops in for gas.
Ed could suggest the Double R to any new faces he sees.
I'll call him. Good.
You do that.
So...
...what shall we drink to?
To Laura.
In our hearts and memories, locked.
Her diary.
Did I tell you I had it?
Laura's diary? Mm-hm.
Shall I read something from it?
It seems appropriate.
Please. Mm.
Ah.
"But still I'm afraid to tell her of my fantasies and my nightmares.
Sometimes she's good at understanding.
Other times she just giggles and I don't have the nerve to ask
why things like that are funny to her.
So I feel badly again and shut up about it for a long time.
I love Donna very mu...
But sometimes I worry that she wouldn't be around me at all
if she knew what my insides were like.
Black and dark and soaked with dreams of...
...big, big men and different ways that they might hold me
and take me into their control."
I'm sorry.
No, don't be.
I... I was just, I mean...
I mean, if that's evidence, shouldn't we give that to the sheriff?
No.
I mean...
I've... I've read this from cover to cover, Donna,
and there are no solutions here.
Besides...
...she gave it to me.
Why?
People come to me and tell me their stories
about the world outside.
I take their stories and place them
in a larger context.
A sort of living novel.
Who tells you?
Oh, friends.
Lovers.
Well, maybe, someday, you will too.
You were right.
Her kidnappers contacted me this morning.
Damn me, but you were right.
Why didn't you alert the sheriff?
They'll kill her at first sign of police involvement. That's why I called you.
That's no reason to circumvent normal channels.
Normal channels won't bring my daughter back to me alive.
You and Audrey...
You have a special relationship.
You, of all people,
understand her value to me.
They wanna make the exchange tomorrow.
Audrey...
...for $125,000.
Cash.
But I must ask you.
Will you take it there?
Josie.
Oh, Pete.
So sorry.
Yeah, me too.
You know, I...
...keep thinking about Andrew.
What he would have done about the fire.
Thank goodness Catherine was here to handle everything.
What is it?
Josie,
Catherine died in the fire.
God, no.
Oh, Pete.
We're...
We're planning a service...
...but they haven't found the body.
Oh, Pete.
In a couple of days we'll go ahead.
I don't know exactly what we'll be burying.
Right this way. Come on, dreamboat. Daddy's waiting.
Come on.
Miss Horne was a very bad girl, refusing to take her medicine.
Please. Weren't you, Miss Horne?
Audrey?
Audrey,
have you been mistreated?
He hit me. Ah.
I did not hit her.
If that's what you're thinking, I didn't.
That was wrong.
It will never happen again as long as you're with me.
Do you understand?
I spoke with your father this morning.
You're in no danger.
Everything going to be fine.
You do trust me.
Don't you, Audrey?
You see, Audrey,
in a situation like this,
you have to handle yourself in a professional manner.
We're all reasonable people and what you discover
is that something reasonable can always be worked out
whenever reasonable people just put their minds...
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
No.
Lucy?
Lucy, we need to talk.
Deputy Brennan,
I thought you preferred the company of your magazine?
Andy?
Maybe you'd better get some air.
Lucy,
I think we're at the point where it would be healthier for everyone
if you got whatever was bothering you out in the open.
Andy and I used to go out.
That much I gathered.
For a year and a half until I started to notice things about him.
They weren't big things, they were little things.
He never exercises.
He never washes his car and he doesn't even own a sports coat.
Uh-huh. Well, did you do something about this?
Well, after I watched this TV show, I decided I needed some me time
during which we didn't see each other.
During which period I met Dick Tremayne.
Horne's Department Store, Men's Fashions.
He had lots of coats and keeps himself and his car in great shape.
Most of his behavior was asinine,
but at least he was different.
Are you still seeing this Dick?
No.
Lucy, do you wanna get back together with Andy?
I don't know.
Well, Lucy, can you tell me exactly what you do want?
I don't know.
Sorry, Harry, I was trying to help.
Well, it was a good thought.
But it's like trying to fix those potholes over on Highway 9.
First heavy rain and pfft.
You've been down this road before?
Sure have.
Harry.
I've got a dangerous situation.
I've examined every possible angle
and I believe there's only one way to proceed.
I need a favor, strictly between us.
What's up?
I need one of the Bookhouse Boys. Your best man.
It would be better if you didn't know why.
Cooper, I've steered clear when you asked me to.
Is there anything I need to know about this one?
Absolutely not.
I'll set it up.
Nine-thirty at the Roadhouse.
Thanks, Harry.
It must be him. Here we go.
Good evening, sir, welcome to the Double R Diner.
Thanks, could I have a booth?
Of course, right this way.
We have two very delicious specials this evening...
I'm sure you do but I'll have a cheeseburger, medium,
a Coke and some fries.
Very good.
Excuse me, Toad?
Why don't we finish this up in the kitchen?
Mm. Mm-mm. There you go.
Get in the back and don't touch anything.
He only wanted a cheeseburger.
It must be some kind of food-critic trick.
You think so? Absolutely, yeah. I think...
[CUSTOMER CLEARS THROAT]
Bathroom?
Oh, right this way, sir.
We just finished painting it and it looks really nice.
It's completely private. Yeah, follow me.
Oh, sorry.
Good stuff. Toad!
Toad, get out of my... Mm. Whoops.
Thanks for coming.
I didn't know... Know what?
I didn't know if you were mad or not.
I mean, how mad.
I'll survive.
Donna, there's nothing going on between me and James.
What if there is? I mean,
who said James and I couldn't see other people?
I certainly didn't.
Are you saying you're seeing someone else?
Maddy, I need your help.
How? Harold Smith has Laura's diary.
I thought the sheriff had Laura's diary.
Harold said that Laura kept a second diary that I didn't know about
and he's got it.
God.
We have to tell James about this.
If Laura did have a secret diary...
...and Harold's got it...
...I'm gonna get it with or without you.
Tell that to James.
I know I paid too much for it,
but I just fell in love with it.
I heard the salesperson say,
"The only reason we're still in business
is because Josie Packard buys retail."
I like it.
You do? I like it, yeah.
You're so cold. Josie.
Josie, I gotta know. Were you really in Seattle?
Yes, why are you so suspicious?
Look at these boxes.
You think I got them at Cash and Carry?
Why didn't you tell me you were going?
You know I had to get away, I was afraid.
I know, afraid of Ben and Catherine. You know that.
And now Catherine's dead.
Harry?
You don't think I... I don't know what to think.
I don't know. You think I could burn the mill?
That I would ruin everything of mine?
There's insurance money.
My God.
How could you?
How could you think of such terrible things?
How could you hurt me so?
I was just so worried.
I'm sorry.
Hold me.
Take me. Josie.
I want you to take me. Josie.
Josie, why? Why didn't you tell me?
Tear it.
What?
Tear it.
I want you.
I need you.
I want you
more than my own life.
Hi, good-looking.
Who do you have to grease to get some coffee around here?
Judge Sternwood. Hello, Your Honor.
Lucy, you're a cool drink of water
to road-weary eyes.
What's your secret?
I'd rather not talk about it, sir.
Give us a hug?
Ah. Life is hard, dear.
Still and all, it's...
It's harder in most places than in Twin Peaks.
Clinton.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, I only just arrived.
Good to see you.
What's her name, Harry?
What? You got the look of a man
with filly trouble, son.
If they don't take the saddle, you got two options.
And I won't bore you with either one. Harry?
Judge Sternwood, Special Agent Dale Cooper.
FBI.
How are you, lad? Your Honor.
You two should have a lot in common.
Sid will bring in the court calendar as soon as the Winnebago
is tanked up.
You wanna break the seal on that Irish you stashed for me?
Right this way.
Mr. Cooper, how do you find our little corner of this world?
Heaven, sir.
Well, this week, heaven includes
arson, multiple homicides
and an attempt on the life of a federal agent.
Heaven is a large and interesting place, sir.
Lucy?
Dick.
Lucy, I haven't slept.
I can't eat.
I've been absolutely miserable.
You have?
I've been a fool, a cad, the way I've behaved and I'm...
I'm deeply, deeply ashamed.
You are?
I've been over it in my mind a million times
and what I've come to is this.
I have to...
No, I must do the right thing.
You must?
It's...
It's everything I could scrape together.
I'm completely knackered.
What is this?
Six hundred and fifty dollars.
I've called around.
I've been told it's more than adequate.
For what?
For the...
To take care of...
You know...
...the little problem.
Richard,
here's what you're going to do:
Take your money,
put it back in your wallet or your pocket,
turn around and walk through both sets of doors...
The second one sticks sometimes.
Go out into the parking lot, get in your car, turn the key,
and never, ever speak to me again
as long as you live!
Say one more word and I'll scream.
Leave, please.
Dick!
Dick.
Leland...
...this is most difficult.
My deepest condolences
on your heartbreaking loss.
Thank you, sir.
You've appeared before me many times.
I know you to be a fine, decent man
and a capable attorney.
And to see you under these circumstances is...
Is dreadful for us all.
Now, the law provides a structure
to guide us through perilous and trying times.
But it requires our submission to its procedures and higher purposes.
Before we assume our respective roles in this enduring drama...
...just let me say that
when these frail shadows we inhabit now
have quit the stage,
we'll meet
and raise a glass again together
in Valhalla.
Would that it were so.
I understand it's your intention to represent yourself.
Correct.
Well, where's Lodwick, the prosecutor?
Overdue. Well, I suggest
we leave the question of bail till morning.
The facilities are adequate, Leland?
Oh, yes.
Everyone has been most kind.
Then we'll say good night.
Deputy. Good night.
Thank you.
I'll speak for us all.
We have hard jobs.
We're ready to roll.
Well, hi, Sid.
Harry.
Sid, say hello to Special Agent Cooper.
Agent Cooper. How do you do?
Well, gentlemen,
we've been eight hours on the road.
Sid and I are gonna pile it over to The Great Northern,
hook up the Winne and dine in the Timber Room.
See you in court.
Wife?
Uhn-uhn. Law clerk.
Man, oh, man.
Harry, is everything set for tonight?
He'll be there. Okay.
Is this your friend Katrina?
Katrina? Katrina.
And this is Miss...
Come along, girls.
All right, Mr. Tojamura. We're all set.
Now, what credit card do you wanna put that on?
Cash, please. Cash?
Fine.
Where did you say you traveled from, sir?
Seattle. Seattle?
Oh, that's not such a long trip, then. Ha-ha.
Very good, Mr. Tojamura.
The bellman will take you up to your suite.
And if you would like to treat yourself
to some of our outstanding local cuisine while you're here,
I would recommend the Double R Diner.
Ask for Norma.
Thank you very much.
Norma, it's Louie.
I think the eagle has landed.
Pete, meet my cousin Jonathan.
Jonathan.
You thinking cousin have some joe?
After a long flight it will help him reset his biographical clock.
Mm-hm. That's "biological."
I think so, I just made a fresh pot.
Here. Cup of joe coming up.
Biological. Biological.
Don't know how you lasted six years.
Nothing but hayseeds and manual laborers.
Well, we all got our job to do.
Yours is nearly finished.
The sale of the mill and the Packard lands?
Signing the contracts soon. I need Pete's signature.
He's Catherine's heir. Will that be difficult?
No. How long?
Two days. We're expected back in Hong Kong.
Mr. Eckhardt wants very much to see you.
Are there any other complications?
There might be a problem with Hank.
I'll deal with him.
Are we suspected? Certainly not.
What about this sheriff?
He means nothing to me.
That's not what I asked you.
Nine-thirty, right on the tick.
Is he here?
He's here.
Are we in any particular hurry?
Harry,
let me buy you a beer. Bartender?
All right, I'm coming!
All right!
Hey, we're not op...
Oh, fart.
What's the deal?
Huh?
Do I know you?
Okay.
Listen, I think I'm just gonna lay here for a while.
What?
Blood brother, next time I take your head off.
﻿1
Diane, it's 6:42 a.m.
Rough sleep.
I had dreamt I was eating a large, tasteless gumdrop.
I awoke to realize that I was aggressively munching
on one of my Air-Pillow silicone earplugs.
Hence the tastelessness.
Perhaps I should keep a closer eye on my after-dinner coffee consumption.
Persistent soreness in the rib area,
which I'm treating each morning with 15 extra minutes of yogic discipline.
After which, thankfully, the pain retreats to a cul-de-sac
in a distant suburb of my conscious mind.
I'm going to begin today with a headstand.
Diane, I am now upside down.
Mind becoming porous.
The day's tasks coming into focus. Objects growing clearer.
Diane, the Giant was right. I did forget something.
"I've gone north. Jack may have the answer. Love, Audrey."
Hey. Thought we'd lost you to the Kalispell woods.
Two retired female schoolteachers live in that house next to the Palmers.
They have no memory of a gray-haired man.
I had to drink three pots of chamomile tea to find that out.
Hmm. Which reminds me.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
Sure. Thanks.
Mm. Keep looking for the one-armed man. We gotta find him.
Excuse me, sheriff, I just wanted to say goodbye
because, as you know, I'm going down to Tacoma for two days
to visit my sister Gwen and her husband, Larry,
who had a baby last week.
Right. That is, Gwen had the baby.
Larry's the father. You remember? It was a boy.
Well, anyway, as soon as the Can-Do temp girl gets here,
I'll explain the phones and the coffee and the intercom...
Lucy, it's okay. And the wag...
We got it covered.
No, she should've been here by now.
I can stay and at least show her... Lucy, don't worry. Just go.
Sometimes the Can-Do girls can't.
But, sheriff... We got it covered.
Have a safe trip, Lucy.
Thank you.
Morning, Coop. Harry.
What is the word on our delivery tonight?
We won't need it. We've got the jump on them.
I know where Audrey is.
You see, the Port-O-Patient will allow you to fluently, uh, transport
the unfortunate Mr. Johnson,
uh, allowing him to even go outside,
and sit and experience what he can of nature.
Mr. Pinkle, I want my cousin Leo Mm-hm?
To have the fullest possible experience of life.
Well, that's what we're here for. Heh. Okay, let's give it one more.
Mr. Pinkle, are you gonna install the ramp?
Well, sure, of course, of course.
Uh, as a matter of fact, I already have some...
Some plywood ramp...
Pinewood ramp boards that I'll install tomorrow. Absolutely.
That's a very good suggestion. Now, I think we are ready to go.
Finally. There we go. All right?
That's a new wrinkle.
I can't believe it. It was working just so perfectly yesterday.
Come on. Come on...
You gotta be tough with this thing. You gotta hit it hard.
A machine is like a woman, we always say at the machine shop. Come on.
Oh, Bobby, are you okay?
Shelly, could you get Mr. Pinkle a cold drink, please?
A diet soda, please. That would be great.
Pinkle, Pinkle, Pinkle.
This thing is a death trap. I told you we have to keep him alive.
The insurance companies don't exactly pay off like the slots.
After we take our cuts,
we had only money for this or a first-rate wheelbarrow.
Oh, thank you very much.
Oh, thanks a lot.
Bobby?
I've gotta meet Leo's lawyer. The hearing's today, right?
Be just another second, folks.
Bobby...
...are we okay?
Oh, that's it. Come and take a look. You can see it.
It works just fine.
Come outside with me.
He can let himself out.
Bobby, we're doing real good. Okay, that's enough. Um...
Bobby? Uh...
Bob, Bob, I can't reach the switch. Bobby, I've got a problem here.
Mr. Palmer has pleaded not guilty
to the charge of murder in the first degree.
The defense has requested bail.
This pre-trial hearing is to determine whether that bail will be granted.
Mr. Prosecutor.
We, the people of the State of Washington,
move the defendant be denied bail.
On the basis of one,
the great seriousness of the crime for which he has been accused.
Two, the apparently premeditated nature of this act.
And three, the oft-witnessed instability of Mr. Palmer
during the period following the death of his daughter.
Sheriff Truman will speak for the defense.
Your Honor,
Leland Palmer is a well-known, well-liked,
well-respected member of this community.
His roots go way back.
His grandfather, Joshua Palmer,
brought the family here more than 75 years ago.
Your Honor, no one can know
what it's like to lose a daughter the way Leland did.
That's all.
Thank you, sheriff.
Mr. Lodwick, would you care?
I thought I might sell this to the Gazette.
They seem to like courtroom sketches.
Yeah, why don't you try for a little more face than that?
High standing in the community,
and the pristine nature of his public...
Just an idea.
Good. Thanks, sheriff.
The defendant is released on his own recognizance.
Now, Leland,
as you know, I will require you to remain in town
and making your whereabouts known to the sheriff
on a regular basis.
Sid, check the calendar,
and we'll set a date for Mr. Palmer's trial
as soon as possible.
Hi. Hi.
Thank you.
Oh, mm.
So, what's behind those deep blue eyes today?
I've got a proposition for you.
I'll share my life with you. I'll tell it to you.
Part of your living novel...
...if you let me read Laura's diary.
It's intriguing.
I'll read it to you.
But it mustn't physically leave this room.
Acceptable.
You'll start? Of course.
A bargain has been struck.
Donna Hayward.
Begin. All right.
I'm from Twin Peaks. Actually, I was born here.
My father delivered me. He's a doctor.
Where are you from?
I grew up in Boston.
Well, actually, I grew up in books.
There's things you can't get in books.
There are things you can't get anywhere.
But we dream they can be found in other people.
Continue.
Maybe our dreams are real.
My turn.
What are you doing?
Maybe I'll read it out here on the lawn.
Please.
We've only just started.
Why don't you come with me?
Come on. What's there to be afraid of?
Come on.
Please?
Give that back to me.
Harold?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
The defense will continue with its evidence.
If you would, Mr. Racine.
You can see from these EEGs,
this chart here, which is actually of my own head,
is intended to show normal brain activity.
Objection to the use of the word "normal," Your Honor.
Well, he's close enough.
Objection overruled.
This chart here is of Mr. Johnson and shows minimal activity.
A previously submitted medical report
states that Mr. Johnson has suffered diffuse brain damage.
He doesn't currently even have the perspicacity
to take the standard CST competency test.
We therefore submit
that trying this individual
would constitute a mockery of the justice system.
A proceeding that the unfortunate young man
would not even faintly comprehend.
Mr. Prosecutor.
I know Leo Johnson isn't in very good shape.
On the surface, it might seem ridiculous to make him stand trial.
But the trial does more than just punish the wrongdoer.
It also brings a feeling of justice and retribution to a community.
Among the various crimes Leo Johnson is suspected of,
the murder of Laura Palmer is the sort that can wound an entire town.
As long as Leo Johnson carries a breath,
All right. he is as eminently deserving of a trial
as this community is of a sense of resolution!
All right.
Now, have a seat, Mr. Lodwick.
Now, you fellas can catch your breath.
I, uh, am going to need to deliberate.
Mr. Cooper, Sheriff Truman,
if I could have the pleasure of your company.
Sid, can you fix us up with three black Yukon sucker punches?
Yes, Your Honor.
Lodwick really planted his feet and looked it in the eye.
I didn't expect him to press on the murder charge.
Cooper, is Leo Johnson our man?
No, sir. I don't believe he is.
Harry, what's the temperature of the town?
Do they want a trial or a lynching?
They want the right man brought to justice.
Well, they don't need a circus.
And this poor bastard,
he seems to be a heady cabbage.
Thoughts, Cooper?
I feel the killer will eventually be apprehended.
You have to watch these. They sneak up on you.
I'm gonna declare Leo Johnson
to be not competent to stand trial.
And when medically possible, that he be shipped home.
Harry, uh, do you wanna tell the little lady yourself?
Thanks, Clinton.
Cooper, how long you been here? Twelve days, sir.
They're not gonna try him. No?
Leo is coming home.
I'll advise you to keep your eye on the woods.
The woods are wondrous here...
...but strange.
Thanks.
Can I get you anything, Nadine?
Who are you? Who am I?
You go to the high school. Well, yeah.
Heh. Yeah, it took me a second. You're not in any of my classes.
Why don't you sit down, honey? Let me get you a drink.
Oh, no, I'll get it.
Where are Mom and Dad?
Oh, uh, out of town.
Oh.
Okay.
You're a jack and I'm a jack And Steeplejacks are we
Wow.
Doc Hayward said to roll with the punches.
Have you thought about maybe taking her to see Dr. Jacoby?
No, he's in Hawaii recovering from that heart attack.
It just came right off.
Mr. Tojamura is here.
Mister who?
Excuse me. Uh...
Do you have an appointment, Mr? Tojamura.
I represent Asian investment bank.
We have superior offer
for Ghostwood Project.
I have commitment letters from Tokyo banks
prepared to move immediately.
This all sounds very interesting,
but unfortunately, I have an important conference call in a couple of minutes.
I have prospectus...
Perhaps some other time. ...and taste.
Five.
Million? Ah.
Leave these. Let my people have a look at them.
Point of visit.
Cooper's on his way.
Your call from Canada, Mr. Horne.
Is that our call? Yes.
You pushed it pretty close.
Benjamin Horne.
Are you ready to play?
Audrey.
I wanna talk to my daughter. That can wait for tonight.
One time. Across the border,
five miles east of Grand Forks, on the road to Castlegar,
is a bar called the Columbian.
Behind it is a failed amusement park.
Go to the merry-go-round.
Leave the briefcase beside the horse with no head,
at midnight, alone.
I'll be sending my representative.
Serialized denominations, as you instructed.
My daughter's life is in your hands.
Stay by a phone.
Follow him.
Make sure that he and the money are neatly delivered.
Bring Audrey back. Cooper's not bringing her back?
Cooper isn't coming back.
If you can manage it,
bring back Audrey and the briefcase.
Five million dollars.
Now, that's a good day's work.
All right, once you're in Harold's apartment,
move as fast as you can.
This is scary.
Laura's diary is in a secret shelf at the very bottom of the bookcase,
behind a row of fake books.
Now, I think that there's a doohickey on the right-hand side
that somehow lets the shelf slide out and down.
All the notebooks look the same, except for Laura's.
Hers is smaller with a red cover.
How are you gonna get him to go outside?
Not outside, just out of the front room.
Then I'll signal you with the flashlight through the window.
The door will be open.
I thought you liked this guy.
I do.
Okay.
Cooper hands me the briefcase.
I take it...
What about Ben Horne?
Well, he give up control of One-Eyed Jack's.
It's yours.
With his daughter dead?
You know, you love a good steak
but you don't want to know how it got on your plate.
You must be serious about your business, Blackie.
How are you gonna do the girl?
Voilà.
Does the girl sleep? Dreamland.
Come, come, come. Come to me.
In the other room, the girl dreams of fishes
and dark lakebeds and tangle weeds.
What about Blackie?
I've waited long enough. We have our fun tonight.
Whoo.
Kiss me.
Right. Okay. Bye.
Laboratory Services.
Yeah, I'm calling for some test results.
Doc Hayward said I could just call you up and...
Yes, what test was it for, sir? What's it for?
Yes, please, sir.
It was for a semen's analysis. Brennan, Andy.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you, sir. Sorry. Brennan, Andy.
Oh, the doctor's analysis is oligospermia, sir.
Yes, could you go slower. I wanna write all this down.
Oligospermia. "Oligospermia."
That's right. That sounds terrible.
I have that? No, sir. You had that.
Oh, I had it.
It means too few sperms. "Too few sperms."
Very good, sir.
You mean I'm cured?
Uh, the doctor says they're not just three men on a...
"Doc says they're not just three men on a fishing trip,
They're a whole damn town. they're a whole damn town."
That's right, sir. Do you understand? Yeah, I know what it means.
It means they're not really real people, they're...
I'm sorry, sir, I've got another call. Oh, okay. Thank you.
You're welcome, sir. Thank you very much.
I'm a whole damn town!
I'm a whole damn town.
Whoo!
Don't ask.
Where were we?
Okay, main bar and greeting room here.
Casino and get-acquainted room.
What's this, Blackie's office? We'll find out when we get there.
The one-armed man is staying in the Robin's Nest Motel on Highway 9.
Nobody's seen him for at least a day, a day and a half.
The room looks lived-in.
I found this.
Same drug as last time.
A weird, deep smell.
We're still waiting on Albert's analysis. Good work, Hawk.
Hawk, see you in the morning.
Okay.
We'll approach through the woods to the rear door.
Inside are stairs leading down to the working rooms.
My guess is, that's where Audrey's being held.
What kind of muscle do they have?
A couple of floor men in the casino, probably more in the back.
Let's go get her.
Good night, Andy. See you in the morning, Andy.
Good work.
"Gwen and Larry."
Adam's Abortion Clinic.
Hi, is Lucy...? What?
Adam's Abortion Clinic.
Oh, my God.
Can I get a cup of coffee to go?
Hi. Hi.
Large, please.
So you seen Donna today? No, sorry.
You? No.
So, what's with the coffee? Coffee?
It's for Uncle Leland.
You don't have coffee at home?
James, I can't talk now.
I need to go. You need to go?
Where are you going? Home. Bye, James.
Donna Hayward.
March 7th, Tuesday. Second session.
Dear diary...
Uh, this is from a long time ago. Is that okay?
I was about 13 years old, 14 maybe.
Me and Laura put on our tightest, shortest skirts. Too tight.
But Laura talked me into it.
We were going to the Roadhouse to meet boys.
Their names are
Josh, Rick and Tim.
They're about 20 years old.
And they're nice to us.
And they make us feel like we're older.
Rick asks if we wanna go party.
And Laura says, yes.
And all of a sudden, I feel this knot building up in my stomach.
But when Laura gets in the truck with Rick, I go anyway.
Stream in the woods.
Full moon, I think.
It's pale and light out.
Laura starts to dance around the boys.
She begins to move her hips...
...back and forth.
Rick starts to clap, but Tim doesn't do anything, he just watches.
Somehow, that makes me angry.
So I say, "Let's go skinny-dipping."
We take off our clothes.
I know the boys are watching.
Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick.
I don't know what to do.
So I swim away.
I feel like I wanna run, but I don't.
Tim swims out to me.
He kisses my hand...
...and then me.
I can still feel that kiss.
His lips are warm and sweet.
My heart jumps.
He's talking to me, but I can't hear him.
Only the kiss.
I never saw him again.
It was the first time I ever fell in love.
That's all.
That was beautiful, Donna.
I got him.
Harry.
Wait here, Harry.
No. Dead end.
Two. Audrey?
Not such a bad way to go, all things considered.
No, no. It's beautiful.
Is she alone? Nancy's with her.
What does she do for you I can't?
Well, something new.
Most people imagine orchids growing in exotic, steamy places.
But you can grow them anywhere.
It's all basically a matter of water and light, isn't it?
It's beautiful.
Here, look.
See, humidity is paramount. Well, the control of it, I mean.
Too much moisture is an invitation to disease.
Three sepals and three petals.
The bottom petal, shaped like a lower lip,
is called a labellum.
So delicate.
Well, it's the landing platform, really, for pollinating insects.
Romantic, isn't it?
Will you excuse me a minute?
Hi.
Would you take me to Audrey Horne, please?
I don't think she's available. Let's double-check.
It's not my idea, okay?
You're nothing but meat on a hook to these people.
Shut up.
Audrey, can you hear me?
Mm... Who...?
My prayers.
Audrey, I'm gonna take you out of here now.
No.
When you leave me with a kiss.
That's the way you want it, that's fine.
Drop the gun.
Slowly.
Now, turn around.
Good thing you guys can't keep a secret.
Good throw.
There's been gunfire.
Truman and Cooper are leaving with your daughter.
Now, who can this be?
Monsieur Lodwick. DA's office, eh?
Is something wrong? No.
You just frightened me, that's all.
Uh, come here.
Tell me about this orchid. This one.
Harold, no, you don't understand.
Maddy!
Wait!
Are you looking for secrets?
Is that what all this is about?
Well, maybe I can help you.
Do you know what the ultimate secret is?
You want to know?
Laura did.
The secret of knowing who killed you.
﻿1
I trusted you.
I invested my heart and soul in you.
We only want to read it. We didn't mean any harm.
I thought you were different.
You made me feel
I could return to the world
and find something decent, pure.
But you're just like all the others.
You lie.
And you betray.
And then you laugh about it!
You are unclean.
You have contaminated me.
Now give it to me. Aah!
Donna. Donna!
No.
He's not coming. He won't. He's afraid.
Did he hurt you? Are you okay? No. I'm fine. I'm fine. I...
I'm sorry, James. It's all my fault.
I'm sorry. No, no, no, don't cry. It's my fault too.
We gotta go to the sheriff now, okay?
You've had enough trouble. I'll go.
No, I'll go. James, just hold me, okay? Okay.
We're all set up inside.
Sluggish pulse.
Pupils constricted.
Breathing slow and shallow.
Needle marks. Most likely heroin.
Poor kid.
Daddy?
Can you see me? Can you see me, Daddy?
Audrey, you got to stay awake.
Can you catch me?
Can you? Audrey.
Talk to me, Audrey.
Stay awake. Audrey?
His tongue is so heavy.
The hand on my throat.
It hurts me.
Oh, God, it hurts me.
Black cold.
I can't breathe.
Help me, please, help me.
I'm sinking. I'm sinking.
All right. It's all right, Audrey, I'm right here. Audrey, I'm right here.
I prayed.
I prayed that you would come.
And you did.
It's okay. It's okay.
She was so brave. I feel terrible. If anything had happened to her...
No more plans, okay? No more going off on our own.
James, he has Laura's secret diary. He could have killed her.
He could have killed you too.
Pretty stupid, huh?
Well, after Laura died,
everything just went by kind of fast, you know.
It's hard to know exactly what to believe in.
Yeah.
But when I saw you tonight, I knew exactly what I believed.
Did you?
It's like if we could put our hearts together
and keep them that way forever, we'd be safe, no matter what.
You and me?
From now on.
Yes.
How is she?
She is through the worst of it.
Heroin, Harry.
This close to a lethal dose.
Hard to imagine such cruelty.
Not really.
Look at this.
Blackie's killer.
I knew I'd seen him before.
Jean Renault. Renault?
Oldest brother of Jacques and Bernard.
Hell of a lot more dangerous.
He runs the northern territories.
Gambling, drugs, extortion, you name it.
Now, I saw
a tape on the TV in Blackie's office of you
playing blackjack the night you and Big Ed went to the casino.
Jean Renault was after me.
The man who caught his brother.
He planned to kill me and he used Audrey as bait.
I went out of my jurisdiction.
Twice.
I've violated my professional code
and now Audrey is paying the price.
You got her back. And she's gonna be okay.
This isn't the first time my actions have brought suffering to someone
I care about, in the name of doing what I had to do.
Damn it. I should have known better.
Doesn't change the fact that she's here now,
not up at Jack's with a needle in her arm.
You know,
you are the best lawman
I've ever seen.
But, Coop,
sometimes you think too much.
Thank you, Harry.
Agent Cooper.
I got your call.
What happened? Did you, uh?
I was able to free your daughter without the payment.
Thank God.
She was being held at a brothel north of the border,
known as One-Eyed Jack's.
No.
It seems the brothel's madam was at least partially responsible
for her kidnapping and subsequent blackmail.
Did you arrest her?
She was killed before I could question her.
No.
Murdered by a man named Jean Renault.
This Jean Renault, did you catch him?
He escaped.
Too bad.
Well, everything seems to be in order.
Your daughter is recovering from a drug overdose.
Drug overdose?
Oh, my God.
She's gonna be all right.
Can I see her?
She's resting comfortably now, I wouldn't disturb her.
I'll call you in the morning.
Yes.
Yes, you do that, Agent Cooper.
Thank you.
Thank you
for bringing my Audrey back to me.
Good night, Mr. Horne.
Poor fellow is really gone.
You ain't kidding.
Oh, I want you to know how much I admire you kids,
standing by Mr. Johnson.
Not taking the easy way out.
Most people would just ship him off.
Yeah, well, Leo's sort of special to us both.
Believe you me, in-home care is the stuff of miracles.
Mr. Johnson should benefit tremendously
from being here among his loved ones.
Oh, we certainly hope so.
Mm. Will you be hiring full- or part-time help?
Um, Cousin Bobby and I will be here full-time.
I just admire your dedication.
Well, everything looks to be in order.
You might want to childproof those electrical sockets.
Okay.
Please sign right there.
Mm-hm. Your check. Thank you.
Um, there must be a mistake.
Seven hundred bucks? Sad, isn't it?
The cost of health care is going through the roof.
It's bringing rain.
We're supposed to get 5,000 a month.
But with figure state and local taxes, equipment fees,
medical and maintenance costs, administrative fees...
Well, you see the results.
Fortunately with you two here,
Mr. Johnson will be more than adequately provided for.
Good luck.
I'll find my own way out.
I have to quit my job, Bobby.
How am I going to make it on this?
I don't know. You don't know?
It was your bright idea to bring him here in the first place.
Come on, Shelly, I'm thinking, all right?
You better think of something, Bobby. For the both of us.
Donna, we already have Laura Palmer's diary.
No, this is her secret diary.
She gave it to this Howard Smith? Harold.
Why? I don't know why.
To hide it or something.
Did he ever actually show you the diary?
No.
But he read from it. I saw her name on the inside cover.
Her handwriting. Are you and James up to something?
He has been warned not to get mixed up...
James has nothing to do with this.
Donna, it is a lot like the boy who cried wolf.
The last time you played this game,
Dr. Jacoby ended up in a hospital bed.
It's not a game.
All right.
I'll try to get someone out there to take a look.
But my hands are full. I can't promise anything.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a Sheriff Harry S. Truman.
You found him. Sheriff, please.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Sheriff Harry S. Truman.
That's me. Federal Bureau of Investigation
Regional Bureau Chief, Gordon Cole.
That's a real mouthful, but I can't hear myself anyway.
I'm Agent Cooper's supervisor.
Pleasure to meet you. Can I speak with you a moment?
Sure. Donna.
Wait here.
And who did you say you were?
I'm Sheriff Truman. Great. Pay dirt.
You have to speak up, sheriff, hearing's gone. Long story.
Got these things cranked up to the max.
Are you looking for Agent Cooper?
When an agent goes down in the field, I jump right up and pay a visit.
Agent Cooper's not here right now.
Albert Rosenfield will not be coming back,
but I've got his lab report right here.
Item: a Vicuna coat.
Albert found fibers in the hall outside of Cooper's room from a Vicuna coat.
Coat was Vicuna?
Sounds real good, sheriff, but I already ate.
Also got a lab report from Albert on the one-armer's syringe.
Albert has never seen a drug like it. A combo. Really weird stuff.
What else does Albert say?
Papers. Papers found near the bloody towel
down the train tracks from the crime site.
From a diary. Please.
There's the one-armer now.
Since when is selling shoes against the law?
Mr. Gerard, we need to ask you a few questions.
Huh? Why don't we move over to my office.
My office. Right.
She looks like an angel.
Audrey?
Audrey?
Your father is here.
Thank God, Audrey.
Thank God.
I was so worried about you.
Were you?
I was worried sick.
You know, it's times like these
that make a man aware of the value of life.
Every raindrop, every sunset.
I'm aware of a lot of new things too, Daddy.
Shh, shh, shh.
Now, we will get you home, safe, warm, in your own bed.
What a terrible experience, terrible people.
The things that you must have seen. I saw so much.
We'll sort it out.
Together.
Yes, Daddy.
You and I.
That's my girl.
My car is outside.
I'll take her home now.
Daddy? Yes, darling.
I would like Agent Cooper to take me home if that's all right with you.
Fine.
Maybe...
Maybe we could all go together. Hmm.
Hi, Ed. I'm home.
Isn't this the swellest dress you have ever seen?
Do you know they didn't look at me twice
when I used the charge card?
Say, Ed, when do my parents get back from Europe, anyway?
Well, uh, pretty soon.
It's neat having the place all to ourselves.
Pretend it's ours.
Like we were married or something.
Well, we can do that. Nadine...
And there's some other stuff we can do too.
Well, like what?
You know, silly. Ha, ha.
You know what I was thinking?
Tonight maybe we could go park by the lake,
and neck.
Wait a minute.
We don't have to go anywhere.
Why, we can just stay right here.
You've kept yourself in fine nick, Josie.
Sapphire earrings,
Parisian perfume,
cashmere sweaters.
Please go.
One-way ticket.
Seattle, Hong Kong.
I have one more day. Keep what you earn.
See what you can fit into your suitcases.
We leave tonight.
I haven't received my insurance money.
And Ben Horne hasn't paid me yet either.
I waited for this for five years.
Mr. Eckhardt will make it more than worth your while.
You can't make me leave.
Be adaptable.
We had an arrangement.
Sheriff Truman is important to you.
You lied to him.
You made him into a fool.
But he is important to you nonetheless.
Leave with me tonight. Or I'll kill him.
He doesn't know anything.
The plane leaves at midnight. Be there.
Or I'll come for you and your sheriff.
That's the arrangement.
Hi. Hi.
I think I owe you an apology.
Not really.
Well, when we were together, you know, just talking,
I felt something. I just wasn't sure.
You looked at me and you saw Laura.
I guess I did.
Wanna know something kind of strange?
What?
I liked it.
You did?
When we were growing up,
Laura and I were so close. It was scary.
I could feel her thoughts,
like our brains were connected or something.
And when she died suddenly,
I got the chance to be Laura.
At least other people saw me that way.
Like the way that you looked at me.
I liked that too.
But it was wrong.
It wasn't one thing or the other.
For a while, I got to be somebody different.
But now I'm just me again.
James,
you and Donna belong together.
That's the best thing.
It's just hard sometimes, you know? How?
If you really love someone,
it's like this bright light is shining on you all the time.
You're right in it and it's great.
But I just don't think you can be that way all the time.
Sure you can.
Well, I want to.
I want to try to make the way my heart feels last forever.
Pretty weird.
I'm going home tomorrow, James.
I came to Twin Peaks for Laura's funeral.
But now it's time to go.
So is this goodbye?
I guess it is.
Bye, James.
To the fire.
Now, to what do I owe the pleasure of this call?
I've got the contract with Pete's signature.
And I want my money.
Of course you do.
All of it. Now. Before you get this.
Josie, Josie.
Surely a mind as quicksilver as your own
can grasp the complicated position that we're in.
Fluidity is everything, you know.
I can't summon up cash reserves that I don't have.
But I have already
and I will be happy to assure you again
that as soon as the contracted payments
arrive from Iceland,
your percentage will immediately be passed on.
I won't leave this office without my money.
Why do I sense that, um, this isn't a negotiable position?
You're under some kind of pressure, aren't you?
Do not play games with me.
Games?
Josie,
this key, ahem, unlocks my personal hotel safe.
Now, in that safe,
I have put together a fascinating dossier on you, my dear,
and your late husband... Andrew's little boat that went boom.
So you behave yourself, lady,
or believe me when I say that I will bury you.
That's a shame.
Because if anything unfortunate were to happen to me,
it would lead authorities
to a certain safety deposit box in a bank in another city,
inside of which there is enough evidence
to lock you away for three lifetimes.
They will bury us side by side.
Stalemate.
Your move.
Cash.
Happily, I can accommodate you.
Sign of good faith.
Tokyo bank.
Five million dollars.
We are finished.
Josie.
Well played.
Leo.
We sort of figured with you getting out and all.
Well, what the hell, we sort of wanted to give you a little party.
Our way of saying, "Hey, Leo Johnson, welcome home."
Welcome home, darling.
Because you're a special guy, Leo. And we just want you to know
that we remember all the great stuff you did for the ones you loved.
Like Shelly here.
Who could ask for a more caring and thoughtful husband?
Making her clean your dirty clothes. Wash your dishes.
Mop your floors. You're a class act, man.
Top to bottom. Class act.
And how about Leo Johnson, wife abuser?
There's a guy I wanna party with.
Soap in a sock.
Internal injuries and barely leaves a bruise.
And last, but I'm thinking,
not least,
we got Leo Johnson, murderer.
Hanging your wife up like a piece of meat.
Leaving her to burn.
Don't let anybody ever tell you
you don't know how to treat a woman, buddy.
This is your life, Leo Johnson.
You deserve it.
Every damn minute.
He moved.
This is too creepy. I don't like this. Okay. Okay, Shel...
Okay, maybe you're right.
I mean, I don't want to exploit him or nothing.
Sorry, Leo. We sort of got carried away.
No need to make your rehabilitation any more difficult than it already is.
Doc Hayward said you needed familiar stimulus.
So we just figured, what the hell...
...kazoos.
Honest, Leo.
Shelly and me are going to do everything we can
to make you feel safe and happy.
Hey, cake. You want some cake?
Oh, look at that.
Ice cream.
Bobby.
Hey, Leo. Oh, jeez.
Oh. Uh...
Man, you gotta be more careful.
Good thing we didn't light the candles.
Agent Dale Cooper.
Gordon, I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
I didn't just get here. I've been waiting the whole afternoon to see you.
What can I do for you?
No matter whatsoever. No apology necessary.
Gave me a chance to meet the local law enforcement team.
A great bunch.
Cooper.
You remind me today of a small Mexican Chihuahua.
Can I speak to you a moment in private, Coop?
Of course, Gordon.
Harry, can we use your office?
You might ask the sheriff if we could use his office.
Go right ahead.
Follow me, Gordon.
I believe in secrecy, Coop.
I'll make this fast. I didn't want to say anything in front of the men.
It's Albert's opinion that you might be getting in over your head.
This worries me, Coop. I feel a certain responsibility.
Albert is wrong, Gordon. You went into the chute in Pittsburgh.
And I want to make doubly sure, in fact triply sure,
that it does not happen again. Copy?
Pittsburgh was a completely different story.
I was wounded in Pittsburgh, Gordon,
but beyond that, the case bears no similarities.
I must say you look all right.
Trace of circles under the eyes, catch up on your sleep.
But restless nights and uneasy dreams go with the territory.
I am tired, Gordon. There is much work to be done.
But mind, body and spirit are up to the task.
Without a doubt, I'm A-okay.
Proud of you, Coop.
Now, Gordon.
What the hell is this about a Mexican Chihuahua?
You've got a problem of a different sort here.
Two and two do not always equal four.
You ought to know, we can hear everything you're saying out in the hall.
Come on in. Why don't you invite the sheriff on in.
An anonymous letter sent to home base
with your name on it.
Looks kind of familiar, doesn't it?
It's a chess deal.
Looks like a chess deal.
It's an opening move from Windom Earle.
Windom Earle.
Bless your heart, Coop.
We're gonna have to watch your back from now on.
With Jerry on the road, well...
I need you back here.
Let's just say
that I have a much better sense of what you've been through
in the last few weeks. I appreciate that, Ben.
And I appreciate the confidence. Really, I do.
If it weren't for your indictment, I could drop you into your old slot.
You know, our friendship, our history together.
But first, I need to know that you're okay.
I'm 100 percent, Ben, 110 percent.
Let me prove it to you.
We've taken a payment from the Icelanders on Ghostwood,
but there's a group from the Orient that wants in, in the worst way.
Jerry is on his way to Tokyo to check them out,
and probably every geisha within a hundred miles.
I'm about to take Mr. Big to dinner.
We need to, uh, buy a little time here.
Well, the first thing we do is, um, resurvey the land.
Required because of the fire.
Then we set up a whole parade of inspectors, federal, county, state,
until Jerry gets back with a full report.
If there's any money, we can run it thru the Caymans.
Pick up some money on the exchange rate.
And if we have to, we can drop escrow into a black hole for six months.
Ah? That's my Leland.
Josie?
Harry, I don't believe you have met my assistant, Mr. Lee.
Pleased to meet you.
I'll take these to car.
What are you doing? I'm going away.
Where? Why?
Harry.
Josie.
I always called you from here.
And then,
it was here I could talk to you...
...and be everything you wanted me to be.
Well, then stay here.
I sold the mill. It's over. I'm going home.
No.
I'm sorry, don't think badly of me.
Mr. Lee, leave us alone.
Josie, you can't leave.
You saying this as the police?
No.
It's best if you forget about me.
I love you.
Josie, I love you.
Would you like a drink, Mr. Tojamura? No, thank you.
You have my cashier's check for 5 million.
I have nothing.
Why?
Well, ahem...
I know so little about you, Mr. Tojamura.
This is a small community.
I'm being careful.
Trying to be sensitive to local concerns.
You must understand the impact
this project will have on the community.
You waste my time.
We shall withdraw.
Oh, no. Please, Mr. Tojamura.
Consider the position that I'm in.
The mill fire created a raft of unforeseen problems,
psychic as well as financial.
I feel it's my duty as a civic leader
to, uh, help foster the healing process.
Even at the, um, temporary expense
of my larger business opportunities.
I know a little about fire.
My family was at Nagasaki.
I'm sorry.
Getting to know you
Getting to know all about you
Getting to like you
Getting to hope you like me
Getting to know you
Would you excuse me a moment?
But nicely
You are precisely my cup of tea
Where might you folks be from, sir?
Right here in Twin Peaks. That's terrific.
How about those Steeplejacks, huh?
Getting to know you
Getting to feel free and easy
When I am near you
Getting to know what to say
Haven't you noticed Suddenly I'm bright and breezy?
Because of all the beautiful And new things
I am learning about you
Day by day
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.
Great Northern audiences are the greatest in the world.
Thank you. Good night.
Drive carefully. The King and I.
Give it a rest, Leland.
Temporary insanity, huh?
Hopefully some of these people will be on your jury.
You will be home free.
You like musicals?
No.
Not even Fiddler on the Roof?
It made me weep like a little baby.
I find the adherence to fantasy troubling and unreasonable.
Yeah.
You're not from around here, are you?
I am a visitor.
Yeah. Well, uh, could I buy you a sake?
No, thank you.
Or how about a nice cold milk?
Please give me my medicine.
I can feel the change. What change?
The drug found in his possession
contains trace elements usually found in Haloperidol.
Do you suffer from schizophrenia?
Multiple personalities? It's too late.
You know this man, don't you? Why'd you lie when I questioned you?
It wasn't me. Don't you understand? Give him the drug, chief.
Not yet. If we give him the drug, Coop,
you'll never see the other side.
Give him the medicine. No.
There is no need for medicine. I am not in pain.
Who are you?
My name is Mike. What are you?
I am an inhabiting spirit.
Who is Phillip Gerard?
He is host to me.
You spoke to me in my dream
about Bob.
He was my familiar.
Where does Bob come from?
That cannot be revealed.
What does Bob want?
He is Bob, eager for fun.
He wears a smile,
everybody run.
Do you understand the parasite?
It attaches itself to a life form and feeds.
Bob requires a human host.
He feeds on fear
and the pleasures.
They are his children.
I am similar to Bob.
We once were partners.
Through the darkness of future past Through the darkness of future past
The magician longs to see The magician longs to see
One chance out between two worlds
Fire walk with me
But then I saw the face of God
and was purified.
I took off the arm.
But remained close to this vessel.
Inhabiting from time to time for one single purpose.
To find Bob. To stop him.
This is his true face.
But few can see it.
The gifted...
...and the damned.
Is Bob near us now?
For nearly 40 years.
Where?
A large house made of wood.
Surrounded by trees.
The house is filled with many rooms, each alike.
But occupied by different souls.
Night after night.
The Great Northern Hotel.
﻿1
Everything's set. They're waiting for us at the Great Northern.
Yeah, a large house made of wood, surrounded by trees.
The house is filled with many rooms each alike,
but occupied by different souls night after night.
The guests will be in the lobby? Full cooperation.
Hawk, you got that warrant for Harold Smith's apartment?
On my way as soon as I finish my coffee.
Hawk, Gordon has mentioned pages...
What I mentioned were pages found near the bloody towel
down the train tracks from the crime site
were from a diary.
Donna Hayward spoke of Harold Smith
having a secret diary of Laura Palmer's.
Could be important. Let me know what you dig up.
Gordon, I understand you're...?
Gordon, I understand you're on your way to Bend, Oregon?
I'm over to Bend, Oregon, official business, real hush-hush.
Good luck to all of you.
Coop. Gordon.
Take good care of Mike.
It was real nice meeting you fellas.
Sheriff. Safe journey, chief.
Thanks.
No.
No.
No.
Sheriff? Sheriff!
Sheriff, what's the meaning of this? What the hell is going on here?
Will somebody please tell me what the hell is happening here?
What in the hell is going on?
Mr. Smith.
Harold Smith?
Morning.
Good morning, dear. Good morning, Maddy.
Uncle Leland.
Aunt Sarah.
Sit. Oh, good, you got some coffee. Good.
Did you sleep well? Very well. Thanks.
I've been thinking.
I've really enjoyed my stay and everything.
Aw.
But I really feel like it's time for me to go home now.
To Missoula.
I've got my job and my apartment.
And I just...
...miss having a life of my own. Uh-huh.
So I think I'll probably be driving back home tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Well, we are going to miss you very much.
But we also understand completely. You do?
We do. We do. Yes, we do.
You have been such a wonderful help.
Yes, but now she has to think about herself, honey.
She's got her own life.
Besides, you'll come back and visit, won't you?
Oh, of course.
I'll come galloping back often. Heh, heh, heh.
It's not like Missoula was at the far end of the universe.
No. Hardly.
Well, good then.
It's all right.
Just know that we love you very much.
I love you too.
Hey, what's that, a note? Yeah.
"I'm a lonely soul."
Poor guy.
It's a good thing Andy didn't see this one.
Oh, yeah.
Take a look at this.
"This is the diary of Laura Palmer."
Pay dirt.
Well, we have bills here that total $1,014.
Including the insurance money
that leaves you with...
Forty-two dollars.
Forty-two dollars. That's a good start.
Forty-two dollars for the month?
How am I gonna make it?
How are we supposed to survive on $42 a month?
We? Shelly, I can't keep telling my mom and dad
that I'm spending the night at Mike's.
What time is it? I'm missing Economics as it is.
"We" meant me and Leo.
Bobby, you said you were gonna take care of us.
I am, Shelly. I am.
I want you to take the necklace back.
We don't have to do that.
I want you to take the necklace back. We need the money.
Shelly, you're gonna keep this necklace.
When am I ever gonna feel glamorous enough to wear it?
Giving Leo a bath? Feeding him his oatmeal?
What about his truck?
He's not gonna be cannonballing down the highway anytime soon.
The police impounded it. We can get it back.
They said if it was used in the commission of a crime
it becomes property of the state.
He wasn't charged with anything. I didn't make the rules.
Okay, okay.
It's like you're blaming me for something.
I'm not blaming you. Come on. Take it easy.
Leo was into a lot of different stuff with a lot of different people.
He was in it for the money.
Bobby, look around you. You really think that Leo had money?
Yes, I do. Having a look at this checkbook,
I don't think he ever stepped foot into a bank.
He must have been hiding it somewhere.
He's alive.
New shoes.
Bobby, he's alive.
He ain't alive, Shelly. But he talked.
It's only... That was a burp. He probably has gas.
You call that a burp?
New shoes.
Did he buy any shoes lately by any chance?
No.
He had me take in a pair of boots for repair.
When? Last week.
Have you got a receipt? Yeah, why?
I don't know. Shelly, go get that receipt.
New shoes.
Want some new shoes, Leo?
Give us what we want, I'll buy you the whole damn shoe store.
New shoes.
Daddy, I know about One-Eyed Jack's.
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
I know about Blackie, I know about Emory Battis,
I know about Ronette, and I know about Laura.
Okay.
I was there. I saw you.
Uh-huh.
You remember Prudence?
I wore a little white mask.
I need to ask you some questions.
Ask away.
How long have you owned One-Eyed Jack's?
Five years.
Did you know Laura worked there?
She was only there for a brief time.
Did you know? Yes.
Did you in any way encourage her to work there?
No. I had no idea.
She asked if she could work in the department store.
Battis sent her without my knowing.
Did you sleep with her?
Did you?
Yes.
Did you kill her?
I loved her.
Norma, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure. What's up?
Um...
With Leo coming home and all...
...I'm supposed to be there to watch him.
And it looks like it's gonna be a full-time thing.
So I was thinking
that I have to quit my job.
Just for a little while anyway.
I'm sorry.
I promised myself I wasn't gonna do this.
It's all right, sweetheart.
I just feel so bad.
I love you. I love working here.
I don't wanna let you down.
You're not gonna let me down.
I'm not?
Look, Shelly, you've got your own life to worry about.
I'll be fine here.
Are you sure? Yes.
Now, you look after yourself.
When you're ready, you can come right back.
It'll be like you haven't even missed a day.
You'll let me come back?
You just try to take a job someplace else and see what happens.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
And I told him I'd been traveling with my parents,
but now I wanted to register for spring semester.
Oh, Eddie, let's sit at the counter.
I'm just dying for a chocolate shake, aren't you?
Hi, Norma.
Say, how long have you been working here?
Well, it's 20 years this April.
Oh, you kidder.
What a kidder. Heh, heh, heh.
Well, it's been about, uh, six weeks, isn't that right, Norma?
Huh? About six weeks.
Oh, yeah, that's right. Well, you see?
When your parents drag you off to Europe or someplace for a month,
then when you get back, it's like you've been away forever.
Two chocolate shakes, please, Norma.
Coffee for me. Extra whipped cream on mine.
Hi.
What's your name? Shelly.
Are you in our class at school?
I don't think so.
Oh.
I'll get the shake and coffee.
Europe? Yeah.
My parents loved it so much they're still there.
Can you believe it?
And they said it was okay for me to stay over at Eddie's.
Is it your parents' house or mine, Eddie?
That's right.
Oh, say, Norma, you're not mad or anything
because Eddie's sort of taking me out, are you?
You and Ed? No. No. Why should I be?
Oh, no reason. Eddie told me you broke up.
It's just that...
...I'm just so sweet on him.
Isn't he just the dreamiest? Nadine.
I can't wait for the start of football season.
Can you? No. Can't wait.
Me neither.
I am just so happy.
Oh, Nadine. Oh, God, I'm sorry.
How'd you do that? There goes another one.
There must've been a crack in this glass from before.
Golly. Don't count on it.
I'm so clumsy lately.
I can hardly believe it.
Shelly, get those Band-Aids, and I'll get a towel.
Oh, Eddie.
I am so happy
I could just kiss you to death.
Oh, boy, Nadine.
I think she's at the diner. Shelly.
Shelly.
There he is, Mike. The late Leo Johnson.
Hank did this? He sure as hell did.
He shot him through that window right there.
Leo, I went to the shoe shop.
I showed them the ticket, and look what they gave me.
New shoes. No, you knucklehead, old shoes.
Leo, he gets pretty fixated.
I hope he gets permanently fixated.
I know you too damn well, Leo.
Something about these shoes, isn't there? Huh?
There's something with these shoes.
I heard about people, you know, muling stuff in their boot.
What, do you think I didn't check these out?
Would you get a hammer?
Don't go anywhere, Leo.
Oh, my God.
What is that, a tape? Don't.
Quit spitting, man.
Well, it's not money.
But who knows?
Diane, it's 2:47 p.m.
I'm in the conference room at the sheriff's station
with the remains of Laura Palmer's secret diary.
A great deal of it has been mutilated.
Much of what I've been able to decipher
supports the contention of the one-armed man.
There are repeated references to a Bob.
He was a threatening presence in her life from early adolescence.
There are intimations of abuse and molestation on a regular basis.
He is referred to, on more than one occasion,
as a friend of her father's.
And I just uncovered this entry
dated less than two weeks before her death:
"Someday I'm gonna tell the world about Ben Horne.
I'm gonna tell them who Ben Horne really is."
Yes?
Audrey. I had to see you.
I'm sorry if I'm interrupting you. How are you feeling?
I spoke with my father. Yeah?
He was sleeping with her.
With Laura.
I don't know for how long, maybe quite a while.
Holy smokes.
She was up at One-Eyed Jack's, working there.
And he owns the place, that's what I found out.
He told you this? Yes.
What are you gonna do?
Harry.
What are you gonna do? Are you gonna arrest him?
Audrey, I don't want you to say a word about this to anyone.
Okay. Okay. Now, go on home.
What's going on?
Without chemicals he points.
This morning at the Great Northern, Mike reached for his arm and fainted
just when a certain person walked into the room.
Harry, we need a warrant.
A warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Horne.
Good news, Mr. Tojamura.
My brother, Jerry, spoke to your people in Osaka,
checked your references at the Tokyo bank,
and the answer to your proposal, my good friend,
is a big thumbs up.
We appreciate your promptness.
Speaking for the entire community of Twin Peaks,
I cannot tell you how pleased we are
to welcome you into the Ghostwood fold.
Thank you so much.
Contract. For your perusal. And a fast approval I...
Sheriff.
What is this? This is police business.
We'd like you to come with us.
Fine. I happen to be in a meeting.
Could you be a little more specific?
You're wanted for questioning in the murder of Laura Palmer.
Is that specific enough for you?
You're insane. Insane.
Mr. Tojamura, I'm sure that this is some dreadful mistake.
You can come quietly
or we can drag you through your lobby in handcuffs.
Cooper, is this some sort of sick joke?
Because if it is, I know people in high places.
You'd better do what he says.
Go away.
Get out of here. Go on, go on.
I'm gonna go out for a sandwich.
No! No! No!
No! No!
You...
No! You can't do this to me.
It's already done. You...
Leland.
Take him down to the holding cell.
We don't know what will happen or when,
but there are owls in the Roadhouse.
The Roadhouse.
Something is happening, isn't it, Margaret?
Yes.
Oh!
Say, look here, buster, you just watch it.
Since the moment we met, I have been strangely attracted to you.
You just better get the hell out of here, mister.
There's something about your eyes, so warm...
...and deep.
And blue as the sky.
Dummy, it's me. It's me.
Catherine?
You look terrible.
Just terrible. Ha, ha, ha.
Tell your heart that I'm the one
Tell your heart it's me
You heard about Harold Smith? Yeah.
It's not anybody's fault.
He was a sick man.
I think he was hurt inside in a way I couldn't figure out.
Everybody's hurt inside.
His whole life was in that house, and I violated that.
You were just trying to find out about Laura.
James, he's dead.
He didn't deserve that.
Shadow in my house
The man, he has brown eyes
Sheriff Truman.
Love moves me
I want you Rockin' back inside my heart
Maddy's leaving.
She is?
Yeah, she's gonna go home.
That's weird. She never said anything to me.
Tell your heart you make me cry
Tell your heart don't let me die
I want you Rockin' back inside my heart
Rockin' back inside my heart
Shadow in my house
Dust is dancing in the space
A dog and bird are far away
The sun comes up and down Each day
It is happening again.
Hm.
Aunt Sarah?
Uncle Leland?
Aunt Sarah, Uncle Leland, what is that smell?
It smells like something's burning.
Oh, my gosh. Aunt Sarah?
Shh! Shh!
Somebody, help me!
Help me!
Laura. Laura.
Laura. Laura. Laura.
Laura, my baby.
Laura. Laura.
Laura.
Laura.
Leland says...
...you're going back to Missoula, Montana!
Dust is dancing in the space
I'm so sorry.
The sun comes up and down Each day
The river flows out to the sea
Love, don't go away
Come back this way
Come back and stay
Forever and ever
﻿1
Hey, Donna. Hi.
James, come on in. Hi.
We just came to say goodbye to Maddy.
Oh, I'm sorry, you just missed her.
In fact, I dropped her off at the bus station not 20 minutes ago.
She's gone? Yes.
She thought that you were coming over last night.
Um, did she say anything?
Well, I would have to say that she was a little bit disappointed.
Leland?
Leland, honey?
Excuse me.
You know, if you'd like, you could write her.
I'm sure she'd be glad to hear from you.
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry we bothered you.
Hey, no bother, no bother.
Say hi to your folks for me, Donna. Okay.
Okay. Goodbye, Mr. Palmer.
Bye, James.
Take it easy now. All right.
Leland? Yes, dear.
Remember to sign us up for the Glenn Miller Night at the club.
Don't worry, dear, I won't forget.
Bye, hon. Bye, Leland.
It smells like a toilet in here. There's nothing...
Jerry, what the hell took you so long?
Ah, gee, datelines, time zones, I don't even know where I am.
God, you look terrible.
Jerry. Ben.
Well, Ben, since your regular mouthpiece
has been charged with murder himself,
I'm gonna be handling your case personally. So let's get started.
Did you kill her?
Jerry, for God's sakes. Sorry, you're right.
The last thing a good defense attorney needs to know is the truth.
Jerry, can you get me out of here?
Well, they can only hold you for 24 hours without charging you.
Or is it 48?
Oh, Jerry, Jerry, I am in trouble here.
Under control, big brother.
Okay, so where are we saying you were on the night Laura died?
I was with Catherine. That's not a good choice.
It happens to be the truth.
Oh, dear.
Is there any sign of her? Bone... Bone fragments or teeth?
Charred corroborating note regarding your whereabouts?
I'm so depressed.
Bunk beds.
Do you remember our first room, Ben?
Me on the top bunk and you on the bottom bunk.
And Louise Dombrowski dancing on the hook rug with a flashlight.
Lord, what's become of us?
You know, the first time I went in,
they thought it was my bladder, so they checked it again.
It was an infection. I hadn't even been near a rusty nail.
I mean, you remember that time my toe turned purple, right?
So instead, I took a bath in baking soda and then my toe came around,
but I got the worst cramps
like I swallowed a kinked hose or something.
Have you seen Andy?
Oh, you must be that native person
I've heard so much about, um, Eagle Eye?
Hawk. Sister?
Oh, yeah, this is my sister Gwen. This is Hawk.
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.
God, how you must hate us white people after all we've done to you.
Some of my best friends
are white people. Oh.
Anyway, oh, come on. My stomach...
Diane, 10:03 a.m., Great Northern Hotel.
Sheriff Truman and I have just been with the one-armed man,
or what's left of him.
In another time, another culture,
he may have been a seer, a shaman priest.
In our world, he's a shoe salesman and lives among the shadows.
Leland Palmer.
Whoops! Excuse me. Whoa!
Does he know we arrested Ben Horne?
Doesn't look like it.
Harry, best if he'd hear it from you.
Hi, Harry, Agent Cooper. Heh. Just having a little fun.
You're looking good, Leland.
Just call me Fred. Ha-ha-ha.
Leland, I'm sorry.
We didn't want you to hear it from anyone else.
We've arrested Ben Horne for Laura's murder.
Huh? He hasn't been charged,
but we're holding him.
Ben? Ha, ha. That's right.
There must be some mistake, Harry.
Ben?
I thought that Jacques Renault had... No.
Ben.
You have a strong case against him? Yes, we do.
Oh, God.
Will you be all right, Leland? Oh.
Yeah.
The law will handle this. As it should be.
Thanks, Harry. Agent Cooper.
Harry, I'll catch up with you.
Leland?
Ahem. Yes.
If you can remember anything unusual about Mr. Horne's behavior
the night of Laura's death, would you please let me know?
I will, of course.
Thank you.
Everything okay?
I'm not sure.
This won't hurt a bit.
Sheriff, I protest this brutal treatment of my client.
After all this man has done for this town...
Now, hold still. Ow!
I'll have the results in a couple of hours.
Thanks, doc. Gentlemen,
I demand that my client either be released or charged.
Never in all my years of practicing law have I witnessed such a complete
and utter disregard for an accused man's constitutional rights.
Jeremy Horne, Gonzaga University, 1974.
Graduated last in his class of 142.
Passed the bar on his third attempt.
License to practice revoked in the states
of Illinois, Florida, Alaska, Massachusetts.
Hey, I'm not on trial here.
Sit down.
Mr. Horne, do you know what this is?
A book. A book.
Take a closer look.
A diary.
We all know about One-Eyed Jack's.
So did Laura.
"Someday, I'm gonna tell the world all about Ben Horne.
I'm gonna tell them who he really is."
She never got the chance, did she?
Come on, Ben, we're all adults here.
Wild, young girl like Laura Palmer, things spin out of control.
She becomes a threat not just to you, but to your business, your family.
You are way out of line.
Well, maybe you don't have anything to hide.
That's not what it says in here.
You cannot talk to me like this! Ben. Ben.
You cannot, you understand? Sit down.
Nice and easy. Gentlemen, I'd like a moment alone with my brother...
With my client.
If you don't mind?
You have your moment.
Ben, Ben.
Ben, if you're gonna blurt out a confession like that,
it's gonna make our options shrink down to a tiny little nub.
All right, what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Your alibi has been roasted.
They can establish motive.
And your blood may have Laura's fingerprints on it.
Ben, as your attorney,
your friend, and your brother,
I strongly suggest that you get yourself a better lawyer.
Okay, one last chance, Leo.
Don't disappoint me.
The mill?
Okay, one last chance, Leo. Don't disappoint me.
The mill?
Keep it simple.
Insurance investigators should read "arson."
Block letters about, uh, 6 feet high.
The deal as we discussed?
Ben Horne, his voice,
and Johnson's voice, Ben and Leo.
Special delivery for Mr. Horne.
Bobby. Oh, God.
Bobby!
He did it again.
It's your turn to clean him this time.
What's that?
That is our ship.
What's that mean?
Since our cash cow in the other room has turned into a sinkhole,
I've decided to pursue a career in business.
Really? Like a salesman?
Oh, no, I'm thinking more executive suite.
Really? Yeah.
Bobby, that sounds great.
I'm gonna give you anything you want.
Um, I want a full-time nanny.
Maybe a French maid. Bobby.
Hello, Norma. Mother.
I trust those are real potatoes and not flakes?
Real potatoes.
Excuse me.
What a nice surprise to see you here.
Mm! Hey, those are good.
I see they taught him a skill in the stockade.
Where is your charming husband? Hank? He's not here right now.
I see.
Mother, I got your message. But if you don't mind my asking,
what are you doing here?
I want to introduce you to my new husband.
Husband?
Ernie, this is Norma.
Hi, how are you?
We're honeymooning. Ha, ha. Ha-ha-ha.
I wonder if I could bother you for a cup of coffee?
Nice girl. She's darling.
Ernie's a financial analyst.
I just love what you've done with your diner, darling.
The flowers add such a measure of cheer.
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
Nice to see those good looks haven't isolated themselves to one generation.
Yeah, I know, go with gold figures. Excuse me.
You still look very smart in that uniform.
Your figure's lovely. It hasn't changed.
Now, I don't mean to be rude, but how long will you be staying?
A couple of days. Ernie wanted to see something of the country.
Why?
I just wish I had known, that's all.
Oh, I didn't mean for you to go into any fuss.
You know me, dear, I'm easy.
What's wrong?
Nothing, it's just that there's a food critic coming
and I'm short on help, that's all.
Food critic. Ooh.
So that's why you tried so hard to make the place look nice.
Norma, hoping to spend much more time with you.
If it's all right, we'd better check in.
I've got a Tokyo fax waiting for me at the desk.
We'll be at the Great Northern.
I'm sorry we missed Henry. I'll call you later, okay?
Okay. Nice to meet you.
He's close.
Nurse.
Could I have a glass of water, please?
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry.
Hi, Norma.
I guess I'm a little late.
Forty-eight hours is not late, Hank, it's missing.
I'm sorry, it was some, uh... Some business I had to take care of.
Business? No, this is business.
Business is a place where you come to whether you feel like it or not.
Norma, I... Don't sweet-talk me,
I'm this far from telling you to take a hike.
Norma, please don't make that kind of judgment until you hear me out.
Because of the bad choices I've made,
there are people out there,
people from my past who wanna see me fail.
I've tried fighting them, but I just get in more trouble.
I've tried running from them, but there's always somebody faster.
I know it's no way for a man to live his life,
but sometimes it's just best
to hold up and wait for the storm to pass.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I'm just trying to keep my head above water.
Maybe next time, you'll ask for a little help.
Next time, I will.
Well, the prodigal son returns.
Heh, Vivian. Hi.
You look great. Thanks. Ha, ha.
Prison treat you well?
Well, uh, ahem, that's a long story.
I'd like to hear it over dinner tonight. I have a new husband.
Heh. Great Northern, 8:30? We'd love to.
I don't think if I'll be able to get there. We'll be fine, honey.
Eight-thirty sharp, we'll be there.
Harry? Oh, hello, Pete.
What you got?
Woodpecker.
Pileated, I think.
Yeah. Here.
Pileated woodpecker.
Outstanding.
Harry?
Yeah, Pete.
Harry, Josie's gone.
Yeah, I know.
When I came home from the late shift,
she left a note on the kitchen table, no explanations, no goodbyes.
A note.
She sold the mill to Ben Horne.
Well, not exactly.
You don't have to explain.
I loved her.
There. I said it.
No offense, Harry. Eh.
I loved her too.
I stood there and watched her go. Watched her assistant
carry her bags away.
Her assistant?
Yeah, Asian fellow. Never saw him before.
What did he look like?
Average height, medium build, ponytail.
Oh, that was her cousin, Jonathan.
She said it was her assistant, Mr. Lee.
Mr. Lee?
Harry, I have a bad feeling.
I'm right there with you, Pete. Harry.
Hello, Pete. Gerard's missing. He knocked the deputy out.
Pete, you'll have to excuse us.
He don't get far.
Hi, sheriff. Agent Cooper.
Lucy?
Lucy? What?
Andy?
Step right in, Pete.
We desperate criminals are locked safely in our cages.
I have a message for you.
Greetings from the boys down at the mill?
Ah. But first, a little music.
Hello, Benjamin.
Oh, I'm sorry I haven't dropped by for a visit, dear.
But I have a strong aversion to prisons.
How awful... She's alive?
The night we spent together lost in love.
When was that? It seems so long ago.
Almost like a dream.
Oh, yes, I remember, it was the night Laura Palmer died.
Memory is so unreliable finally, maybe it was a dream.
Maybe it never happened.
To tell you the truth, I can't be sure anymore.
What does she want? I'll pay anything. What does she want?
You okay there, Benji?
In exchange for my testimony, dear,
you will sign the mill and Ghostwood Estates back over to me.
I will consider letting you keep your precious hotel.
A representative of mine will come to you
with the documents within 24 hours.
If you won't cooperate...
Well, I'm confident that you'll go on from here
to excel in one or another of the many fine career opportunities
offered by the federal prison system.
Ben, so nice to see you again.
She set me up.
That Catherine.
She set me up.
She's a cautioned, isn't she?
You set me up! You bitch! You bitch!
I'll get you, you bitch.
Set me up.
Chicks and ducks and geese
Better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey With the fringe on top
When I take you out in the surrey
With the fringe on top
Harry, are driver education programs mandatory in your school system?
Yep.
I think we got a dropout. Harry, look out.
Uh-oh.
With the fringe on top
Leland. Ah. Heh.
Agent Cooper, Harry, I'm sorry.
Are you two all right? Leland, we're fine. How about you?
Oh, sure, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I was just on my way to the club to try out a new set of irons,
and, uh, I must have started thinking about Ben.
I guess my mind just wandered.
It's a good idea to leave your troubles at home when operating a vehicle.
You're right, of course. My apologies.
Ah! I did remember something,
as you asked, about the night Laura died.
I was working late at the office with Ben, it was about 10:00.
He left the room to make a phone call.
I don't know who he was talking to, but his voice was raised, he was angry.
I heard him mention something about
a dairy.
A dairy? That's what I think, yes.
A diary. That could be it.
Sheriff Truman, this is Lucy.
Are you there, sheriff? I have an urgent message from Hawk.
Do you play golf, Agent Cooper? Uh, yes, Leland, I enjoy its precision.
I'd like to invite you for a round at the club someday.
May I show you my new clubs?
Uh, sure.
Cooper.
They found Gerard. Near the waterfall.
Better go. They're waiting for us.
Let's go get him. Leland, we'll see those clubs another time.
I understand, Agent Cooper. You let me know
if there's anything I can do to help. Will do.
Poor Andy.
You know, the exact same thing happened to me
when I first got pregnant.
I would be out shopping,
and then boom, pass right out in the produce section.
Then come to covered in bruises and crushed fruit,
and strangers standing over me waiting to see if I was dead.
You see, people want terrible things to happen to you, I know.
I wanna talk to you about my sperms.
Sperms? You know, that is all men think about.
You know, I remember when little Carl was first born
and they laid him out on my breast,
I looked down and saw what kind of a tiny little creature I was dealing with.
And I thought to myself, I thought, "My God, just what the world needs,
another sperm gun running around loose. Right? Women beware."
Well, I did.
I had mine counted twice. The first time, they were all dead.
Oh, man, if I had a nickel every time I heard that one.
Second time, they were jumping like... What? What?
Like salmon swimming upstream.
So, of course, all you could think of was spawning. Ha, ha.
Shut up. Shut up, Gwen.
So when you told me that you were pregnant, I didn't think it could be me
because mine were all dead supposedly at the time.
Uh-huh.
But they got better. I was misinformed. I'm the father.
Oh, brother.
Aren't I?
Oh, yeah. Oh, come here.
You want to see your mean Aunt Lucy.
Oh, aren't you neat, you little snooky-bookems.
Oh.
He's been close.
Bob is not here now.
Sheriff. Sheriff?
Isn't there something that you'd like to share with us?
Oh, great.
And would you tell this guy to stop staring at me like I'm a dog biscuit.
Bob has been very close.
Who's Bob? I don't know a Bob.
Do we know a Bob?
Sheriff, no offense, but clearly, this man's stairs do not reach the attic.
Now, your 24 hours are up.
You either charge my client or let him go!
Ben Horne, I'm charging you with the murder of Laura Palmer.
Yeah. Good move, Jer.
Hawk, take Mr. Gerard back to the hotel.
Nail all the windows shut. No. No.
I want two men on the door. You two-bit lumberjack.
You're finished in this town. Don't make it worse.
You're finished.
Calm down.
What are you doing? Step outside, please?
I'm all right.
Harry. Harry, I think we're saddling the horse before we're ready to ride.
I don't follow.
I don't think Ben Horne killed Laura Palmer.
What? You should release him.
Cooper?
I've backed you every step of the way. I've had enough of the mumbo jumbo.
I've had enough of the dreams, the visions, the dwarfs, the giants,
Tibet and the rest of the hocus-pocus.
Now, we've got hard evidence against Ben Horne.
It's my job to lock him up.
You're right, Harry. This is your back yard.
Sometimes an outsider can forget that.
Well, the salmon was fresh and firm and just a little bit overdone.
Mine too. Just right.
Would you excuse me for a minute, please?
I'll join you.
Ladies, hurry back.
You're not gonna say anything, are you?
If Vivian ever found out I'd been inside she'd...
She'd drop me flat.
I like your new hair color.
Ernie Niles.
Ernie "The Professor" Niles.
So when did you? A couple of weeks ago.
Let me tell you, Ernie,
without you in there to pal around with the last six months were sheer hell.
Nobody to go to the library with.
Nobody to stamp out license plates with.
So, uh, what's your angle here with Miss Moneybags?
No angle.
Come on, buddy, we don't have any secrets.
Vivian's rolling in dough.
I met Vivian at a Republican fundraiser.
We're married. Heh.
You must have told her some tall tale, a whopper.
I'm trying very hard to tell nothing but the truth these days.
It's, uh, therapeutic.
And Vivian wants me to handle all her investments.
What about yours? Introduce her to your loan shark?
I'm out of it, I'm out of it, Hank. I don't gamble anymore.
I go to meetings. I go to church too.
So, what happens when Vivian finds out that you ran off
with the congregation's picnic fund? I never stole from a church.
It was a savings and loan.
I was sick, it was an illness. I paid my debt.
It's a new life, a clean... Clean slate.
So she really doesn't know? No.
Well, Ernie, this is interesting to me.
Because family is the most important thing in the world to me.
One must be prepared to pay any price to protect it.
Don't you agree?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I completely agree.
We'll talk more later, Ernie.
I've always enjoyed our talks in the yard,
man-to-man, prisoner-to-prisoner.
We're back. Ladies.
I would like to propose a toast
to the newlyweds and their happiness.
Thank you, Henry. It's very generous.
To Ernie and Vivian,
to much success in their future and all their future dealings.
How sweet.
That's sweet.
Diane, it's 11:05 p.m. I'm in my room at the Great Northern Hotel.
There's not a star in the sky tonight.
Ben Horne is in custody.
The trail narrows, Diane.
I'm very close,
but the last few steps are always the darkest and most difficult.
Hi. Audrey?
Can I come in and talk? All right.
Is that where you got shot? Yeah.
Did you arrest him?
Yeah.
Did he do it?
That's for a court to decide.
What do you think?
What I think doesn't really matter right now.
Did you arrest him because of what I said?
Only in part.
But it helped?
Yeah.
All I ever really wanted was for him to love me.
I'm sure that he does.
He's ashamed of me.
No, he's not.
Agent Cooper,
when I was at One-Eyed Jack's, I never, never let anyone...
Audrey, you don't have to say anything.
I want you to know.
I know.
I have to get that.
Okay.
Cooper here. Where?
How long ago?
I'm on my way. What's wrong?
I want you to go to your room and lock the door.
Why? No questions, do what I say.
All right.
It's Maddy Ferguson.
﻿1
The short answer is,
this is the work of the same ghoul who killed Laura.
More fan mail.
The letter O under Maddy's ring fingernail.
There were strands of fur clutched in her right hand.
What kind of fur? White fox.
The strands were laced with formaldehyde. A dead animal, stuffed.
I'll make phone calls. Leland will know how to get a hold of Maddy's family.
Harry, don't make any calls.
I need 24 hours. For what?
To finish this.
Cooper.
In observation...
...I don't know where this is headed.
But the only one of us with coordinates
for this destination and its hardware is you.
Go on whatever vision quest you require.
Stand on the rim of the volcano, stand alone and do your dance.
Just find this beast before he takes another bite.
God help me, I don't know where to start.
You're on the path. You don't need to know where it leads.
Just follow.
I thought you'd never get here.
I went for a ride this morning.
God, the engine sounded like a thousand people singing.
What were they singing about? What do you think?
Last night? I could sing about last night.
I got something for you.
Open it.
Oh, James.
I didn't know what size to get.
And the girl at the jewelry store had these really big hands.
But I'll bet...
Perfect.
James.
I just think we should be together all the time.
Really?
If that's okay with you.
It's perfect. Heh.
Ew.
Whatever fowl did you take these eggs from?
Are we saying we don't like it?
I'm afraid I'm gonna run into a thumbtack.
Mother, can't you ever say anything nice?
I've tried so hard. I try so hard,
and nothing is good enough for you.
Let me correct myself. Nothing I do is ever good enough for you.
Well, that's not true. The menus are very presentable.
Oh, I'm joking.
Honestly, let me make a suggestion.
If you wanna serve a truly memorable omelet,
try white veal sausage and morel mushrooms.
Thanks. I'll go pick the mushrooms.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Hello, Donna.
Hello, James.
What did you say?
It's French. I know it is, tell me.
Donna, what's the big deal?
You know Mrs. Tremond?
Miss who? Mrs. Tremond.
Her grandson does the magic tricks. He told me this.
But it was Mr. Smith.
Harold? He left a suicide note.
You know, it means, "I am a lonely soul."
I have to find Agent Cooper.
Donna, what's going on?
Hey.
Mrs. Tremond's the one who told me about Harold Smith.
She has a grandson and he said this to me.
The same words that are in Harold Smith's suicide note.
Maybe the boy said the same thing to Harold.
No, Harold's world was in his words.
The suicide note has to be a message.
It all leads back here.
She's pretty old. It might take a second if her grandson isn't here.
May I, uh, help you? Is Mrs. Tremond home?
I'm Mrs. Tremond.
It must have been your mother I spoke to.
My mother? She passed away three years ago.
I live here alone, honey.
No, she was here. I spoke to her. And her grandson, he was here too.
But I have no children.
But he was here. They both were.
Donna, we'd better go.
Donna? Are you Donna Hayward?
Yeah. Just a moment.
I've never seen her before in my life.
I thought you delivered meals here.
Uh, the morning after poor Harold died, I found this in my mail.
I meant to turn it in.
It's for you.
Thank you.
It's Harold's handwriting. Open it, Donna.
It's Laura's diary, a page from her diary.
Read it.
"February 22nd.
Last night I had the strangest dream.
I was in a red room with a small man dressed in red
and an old man sitting in a chair.
I tried to talk to him.
I wanted to tell him who Bob is because I thought he could help me.
My words came out slow and odd.
It was frustrating trying to talk.
I got up and walked to the old man.
Then I leaned over and whispered the secret in his ear.
Somebody has to stop Bob.
Bob's only afraid of one man, he told me once.
A man named Mike.
I wonder if this was Mike in my dream.
Even if it was only a dream, I hope he heard me.
No one in the real world would believe me.
February 23rd.
Tonight is the night that I die.
I know I have to because it's the only way
to keep Bob away from me.
The only way to tear him out from inside.
I know he wants me, I can feel his fire.
But if I die, he can't hurt me anymore."
Laura and I had the same dream.
That's impossible. Yes, it is.
Deputy, take Donna home.
I've got to see Gerard.
He's completely dehydrated.
His breathing is becoming more difficult. He needs that drug.
Mike. Mike, I need you to talk to me.
Any longer could kill him. Mike.
Bob has killed again.
I need to know something. I need you to help me.
Bob was in my dream, Laura Palmer was in my dream, so were you.
And Laura dreamt about me the night before she died.
The same dream that I had.
I need to unlock that. I need... The answer is inside of me.
Bob and I, when we were killing together,
there was this perfect relationship,
appetite,
satisfaction,
a golden circle.
A golden circle.
A ring.
My ring.
I gave my ring to the Giant.
He is known to us here.
Then he's real?
As real as I.
He can help you find Bob.
How? You must ask him first.
How do I do that?
Oh, you have all the clues you need.
The answer is not here, my friend.
The answer is here.
I don't understand.
So much responsibility.
I know about you.
That milk will cool down on you
but it's getting warmer now.
"Getting warmer now."
Box and tag everything in these drawers. Everything.
Coop, we found his telephone records. Look at this.
The night Laura died. Telephone call Leland told us about.
Ben called her number from this office.
White fox.
Yeah, white, dead and stuffed. Maddy was here.
I think Ben killed her in this office, then took her to the waterfall.
He killed Laura and he killed Maddy.
Madeleine Ferguson died the night before last
between 10 p.m. and midnight.
That fits. We didn't take Ben in until after midnight.
That's as close as I can cut it.
Ben Horne's blood test.
A couple of minutes, I'll have this up to code. Tweaking the sensors, mostly.
Don't want your sprinklers to be overly jumpy.
Gotta set it just so.
I wanna talk about my child, our baby.
Maybe. Maybe what?
Maybe it is our baby and maybe it isn't.
Dick?
Oh, my Lord, is he the father?
At first I thought you were the father.
But then you said you didn't have any sperms.
Then I thought it was Dick, but now you say your sperms are back.
So as far as I can tell, it's a 50-50 proposition.
Andy, where are you going?
What are you doing?
Who are you calling?
I want to speak to Richard Tremayne, Men's Fashions.
Yes, I'll hold.
You won't hurt him, will you, Andy?
Tremayne, Brennan. Andy Brennan.
We need to talk.
That is, if you're not too busy.
Tojamura-san.
How nice of you to come calling.
You are in prison.
Yes, well,
a momentary inconvenience, I assure you.
We have papers to sign.
The Ghostwood contracts.
Tojamura-san,
I'm afraid there's, uh... There's been a snag.
A snag?
Unforeseen difficulties. Some legal in nature, others, uh...
I, uh... I'm unable to sign the Ghostwood agreement at this time.
Then you will return my 5 million dollars.
Well, I want to return your money.
I want to sign the contracts.
Tojamura-san,
as you can see,
I am incarcerated.
Falsely accused,
but my brother, heh, the boy genius,
is out looking for a better lawyer.
And until justice is done,
until I am able to breathe the air that free men breathe,
I plead with you for understanding.
This is the long, dark night of my soul.
Time to seek that...
...tiny flickering flame within.
Forgive me, I've been very emotional lately.
Catherine?
Benjamin Horne.
You're a slimy rat bastard.
And I intend to make whatever remains of your pathetic existence
a living hell.
Oh, Catherine.
Oh! Ha, ha.
Oh, my God.
You've come.
Oh, Catherine.
Catherine, Catherine, tell Sheriff Truman
about the night that we spent together
the night that Laura was killed.
You want me to beg? Huh?
You want me to beg? Because I'll beg.
Will you sign Ghostwood and the mill over to me?
In a heartbeat.
Oh. Clever disguise, Catherine.
Really brilliant. Oh.
Signed, sealed
and delivered.
Now, you'll tell the sheriff, huh?
You'll tell the sheriff.
I'll consider it.
Catherine. Catherine, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
It's the truth, after all.
Heh, why, Ben, we've spent our entire adult lives lying to each other.
Why spoil it with the truth now?
Catherine.
Catherine!
Donna,
I'm so happy you stopped by.
We haven't had the time to just sit down and talk for so long.
May I get you a glass of lemonade?
No, thanks, Mr. Palmer. I only have a minute. Uh...
This is for Maddy. It's a tape of a song we did with James.
I want her to have a copy.
That's very sweet of you.
She told me all about this.
She said it was a very enjoyable experience.
Anyway, if you could mail it to her, I'd really appreciate it.
No, it won't be any problem at all.
Heh. Is something wrong?
No.
Those glasses.
They were Laura's. Maddy gave them to me.
I thought they looked familiar.
Mr. Palmer, Huh?
Did you know that they found Laura's secret diary?
Diary? Yes, they took it from her room.
No, not the one the police found.
She had another one.
I didn't even know about it, did you?
No.
She gave it to a man named Harold Smith.
Harold killed himself a few days ago.
The police found it in his apartment.
Oh, my God.
I had no idea.
I wish I knew what was in it, don't you?
I think about Laura all the time.
Oh, excuse me.
Hello?
Yeah, Beth, how are you?
No, not since yesterday.
Of course, Beth. I took Maddy to the bus station myself.
Well, I...
I'm sure there must be some perfectly reasonable explanation.
Yes, of course. I'll call you immediately,
within the hour.
Bye, Beth.
Huh.
Maddy?
It's the strangest thing.
She never made it home.
Oh, God.
Oh. Donna, don't you worry about a thing.
I'll get us some lemonade
and we'll sit down and give it a think
and we'll work the problem out.
Together.
I knew she was expecting us, I mean...
I guess I was selfish. I thought I could see her any time.
Missoula's not that far away, right?
Donna, you're taking this much too much to heart.
I'm sure she's just fine.
I know the cure for what ails you.
It's simple, really.
It always makes me feel good.
May we have this dance...
...please?
You stay right there.
Harry?
Leland, we need your help.
What is it?
There's been another murder. Oh, my God.
I can't tell you why or how but we need your help and we need it right away.
All right, anything, certainly. Let me get my coat.
Maddy.
What's the matter? What's wrong?
It's Maddy. What about her?
She's dead.
It was the same killer. The same one who killed Laura.
I heard Mr. Palmer get a phone call from her mother.
She said she hadn't gotten home yet.
Then they came over to talk to him, Sheriff Truman.
We could've helped her. How?
I don't know.
This is no good. What do you mean?
You mean us?
I gotta go. James, it's not our fault, don't leave.
It doesn't matter, don't you see?
Nothing we do matters. Nothing's ever gonna change.
It doesn't matter if we're happy and the rest of the world goes to hell.
James, don't leave.
James, don't leave me!
Harry.
Leland.
Why are we here, Agent Cooper?
Is someone meeting us?
Yes.
Is it the killer?
I don't know. Maybe.
Ed, glad you're here.
I need everyone's help to clear the room.
I need a large space in the center.
Of course.
Hail, hail. The gang's all here.
Bobby, why don't you wheel Leo back over there?
Stay very, very quiet, you read me?
Give yourself a raise, Hawk.
Gentlemen, two days ago a young woman was found murdered
by the same individual, I believe, responsible
for the death of Laura Palmer.
I have reason to believe that the killer is in this room.
As a member of the Bureau, I spend most of my time
seeking simple answers to difficult questions.
In the pursuit of Laura's killer, I have employed Bureau guidelines,
deductive technique, Tibetan method, instinct and luck.
But now I find myself in need of something new,
which for lack of a better word we shall call "magic."
Would you like us to hum?
A Tibetan chant, perhaps.
I think it's going terrifically well, don't you?
Now what?
Harry, I'm not completely sure.
Someone is missing.
Excuse us.
Major Briggs, right on time.
I was on my way home.
This kind gentleman flagged me down,
asked if I could drive him here.
I know that gum. I used to chew it when I was a kid.
That's my most favorite gum in the world.
That gum you like is going to come back in style.
My father
killed me.
Ben Horne,
I would like you to accompany me to the sheriff's station.
You might like to bring along Leland Palmer as your attorney.
Let's take him down to interrogation.
Agent Cooper, is he going to be charged?
Yes.
Then I think I'd like to begin bail proceedings as soon as possible.
He'll have his day in court.
Harry.
Everything will be all right, Ben.
Hawk, take Ben upstairs and release him.
Leland? That's not Leland.
How did you know?
Laura told me in her dream.
We're gonna need a lot stronger evidence than this.
How about a confession, Harry?
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
Oh, yeah. I suppose you wanna ask him some questions, huh?
Did you kill Laura Palmer?
That's a yes.
How about Madeleine Ferguson?
What do you think? I'm asking you.
What do you think? Answer the question.
Oh, gosh, gee, gee whiz. I guess I kind of sort of did.
I have this thing for knives.
Just like what happened to you in Pittsburgh that time.
Huh, Cooper?
Oh, Leland.
Leland, Leland.
You've been a good vehicle
and I've enjoyed the ride.
But now he's weak and full of holes.
It's almost nearly time to shuffle off to Buffalo.
Does Leland know what you've done?
Ah, Leland's a babe in the woods
with a large hole where his conscience used to be.
And when I go, children, I will pull that ripcord
and you watch Leland, remember. Watch him.
But not for long.
That's enough for me.
Dick,
could you come with me, please?
Okay, here's how this is going to work.
I'm going to keep my baby. Oh.
That's not open for discussion.
I see. Be quiet, let her talk.
Got a light?
No.
You were saying.
There's only one way to handle this.
They have a test to determine the blood type of the father.
It could be you
or it could be you.
They won't be doing this test until after the baby is born,
during which time I expect complete cooperation
from each of you two gentlemen.
Whatever you say, Lucy.
I mean, it is your baby.
Thank you.
Ben Horne's blood test, he's the wrong type.
Harry, the answer was right in front of me from the very beginning.
What did the little man do in my dream?
He danced.
After Laura's death, Leland danced compulsively.
We were told that Bob the killer was a gray-haired man.
When Leland killed Jacques, his hair turned gray overnight.
Leland said when he was a child
the gray-haired man next door was named Robertson.
Mike said the people Bob inhabited were his children.
Robertson, son of Robert.
The letters under the fingernails: R, O, B, T.
Bob was spelling his name.
A signature on a demon self-portrait.
Why would he kill her?
Laura was writing about Bob in her diary.
Leland found it, ripped out the pages. She knew he was on to her.
It was Leland who placed that call from Ben Horne's office
to Laura the night she died.
He was the third man outside Jacques' cabin.
He took the girls to the train car. It was his blood we found, not Ben Horne's.
Then why kill Maddy? Maybe she reminded him of Laura.
Maddy was going home. He couldn't bear to part with her.
He wanted to relive the experience
or maybe she realized Bob was the killer and he found out.
Now, this Bob.
He can't really exist. I mean, Leland is just crazy, right?
Through the dark of futures past
The magician longs to see
One chants out between two worlds
Fire walk with me
I'll catch you with my death bag
You may think I've gone insane
But I promise I will kill again!
Harry, hurry.
The key.
Leland!
Harry. Leland.
Call an ambulance.
Oh, God, Laura.
I killed her.
Oh, my God. I killed my daughter.
I didn't know.
Laura, forgive me.
Forgive me.
Oh, God. It's okay.
It's all right.
I was just a boy.
I saw him in my dreams.
He said he wanted to play.
He opened me and I invited him and he came inside me.
He went inside?
When he was inside, I didn't know.
And when he was gone, I couldn't remember.
He made me do things...
...terrible things.
He said he wanted lives,
he wanted others.
Others that they could use like they used me.
Like Laura?
They wanted her.
They wanted Laura, but she was strong.
She fought them.
She wouldn't let them in.
Oh, God.
They had me kill that girl, Theresa.
And they... They said...
...if I didn't give them Laura,
they'd have me kill her too.
But she wouldn't let them in?
She said she'd die before she let them.
And they made me kill her.
Oh, God, have mercy on me.
What have I done?
Oh, God, I love her.
I loved her with all my heart.
My angel, forgive me.
Leland.
Leland, the time has come for you to seek the path.
Your soul has set you face to face with a clear light
and you are now about to experience it in its reality,
wherein all things are like the void and cloudless sky
and the naked, spotless intellect is like a transparent vacuum
without circumference or center.
Leland, in this moment, know yourself
and abide in that state.
Look to the light, Leland.
Find the light.
I see it.
Into the light, Leland. Into the light.
I see her.
She's there.
Into the light, Leland.
She's beautiful.
Into the light.
Laura.
Don't be afraid.
He was completely insane.
Think so?
But people saw Bob.
People saw him in visions: Laura, Maddy, Sarah Palmer.
Gentlemen, there's more in heaven and earth
than is dreamt up in our philosophy.
Amen.
Well, I've lived in these old woods most of my life.
I've seen some strange things but this is way off the map.
I'm having a hard time believing.
Harry, is it easier to believe
a man would rape and murder his own daughter?
Any more comforting?
No.
An evil that great in this beautiful world...
Finally, does it matter what the cause?
Yes, because it's our job to stop it.
Yeah.
Maybe that's all Bob is.
The evil that men do.
Maybe it doesn't matter what we call it.
Maybe not.
But if he was real, if he was here,
and we had him trapped
and he got away,
where's Bob now?
﻿1
Sarah.
I'd like you to take this.
Doc,
I don't want it.
I wanna be there.
Every part of me needs to be there.
For both of them.
Today I bury my husband.
Next to my only child.
Her grave is still so...
...new. There's only a little bit of grass on it.
Mrs. Palmer, there are things dark and heinous in this world.
Things too horrible to tell our children.
Your husband fell victim to one of these long ago,
when he was innocent and trusting.
Leland did not do these things. Not the Leland that you knew.
No.
That man I saw.
Long, dirty, disgusting hair.
He's gone. Forever.
So is everything I loved.
Sarah.
I think it might help to tell you what happened just before Leland died.
It's hard to realize here and here
what has transpired.
Your husband went so far as to drug you to keep his actions secret.
But before he died,
Leland confronted the horror of what he had done to Laura
and agonized over the pain he had caused you.
Leland died at peace.
In his last moments, he saw Laura.
He kept saying how much he loved her.
And I believe she welcomed him,
that she forgave him.
It's time.
Mrs. Palmer, I would be honored to drive you.
Leland always found the other earring.
I don't know about you... Excuse me.
Get some of this Waldorf salad here. There we go.
Nice to see you too. Yeah.
I got this for Sarah.
Here you go.
While it's hot. Oh, thank you very much.
Mm-hm.
Do they invite people to these things, or do they just show up?
At a time like this, people just naturally come together.
It's a time of reaching out.
I remember when my mother died,
there must have been a hundred people.
Seems like the whole town is falling apart.
Somehow James thinks it's his fault.
First Laura, then Maddy.
Maybe he blames me, I don't know.
Two people in love couldn't have caused all this, could they?
Oh, honey.
He'll come back.
Everything's gonna get better.
Welcome home, Dr. Jacoby. Major.
You appear to be fully recovered from your recent setback.
Well, nothing beats the restorative powers of Hanalei Bay.
Sheriff, how are you? Major.
What's the matter?
Doesn't she feed you?
You're just jealous. Jealous?
Oh, I... I... I wouldn't... I wouldn't spend my time changing diapers.
What's next for you, sir?
Well, major, I'm not exactly sure.
I've stockpiled a few weeks of vacation time.
Now might be the time to cash them in.
For starters, would you care to join me
for an incredibly pleasant evening of night fishing?
Aces.
Eddie,
can you see my underpants in my shoes?
I looked down and I thought I could see the reflection.
Do you think boys are looking up my dress?
Sweetheart, I can't see a thing in your shoes.
I promise.
Okay.
Donna came over to see Laura.
Do you know what they did?
It was late. We'd made popcorn.
And they made this very serious promise to each other,
to be best friends forever.
I... I think it was a kind of bond
against...
Dying.
I need to remember all this.
Besides, she's cursed.
Aah! Oh! Aah! Aah!
Boys, take it easy. Take it easy. Come on.
I'm gonna stick his head in the gutter where it belongs.
Dwayne, now knock it off. Knock it off.
Remember where you are and why we're here.
Please.
They seem to be having fun.
The mayor and his brother.
Dougie owns the newspaper.
They've had a running feud going for 50 years.
Nobody knows how it started.
Something about an old flame and a rumble seat.
I don't even think they remember anymore.
Well, the nest's a little stirred up right now.
Dougie's engaged to be married to a babe.
For the fifth time. She's still in her teens, he's 110.
One of those January-December sort of deals.
You remember the first time Dwayne ran for mayor? When was that?
Oh, um... Sixty-two? Yeah, 1962.
Dougie wrote an editorial, came out against Dwayne.
And Dwayne was running unopposed.
Harry, I'm really gonna miss this place.
You're asking me to admit a 35-year-old woman
to the senior class.
You got me there.
Eddie, how much longer? Class is starting.
We'll be right out, Nadine. Just a few more minutes.
Guess what. Cheerleading tryouts today.
I just saw a notice on the bulletin board.
That's great, honey. Um...
Why don't you go practice your splits?
Okay.
Bellman?
Customer relations.
Has everything been satisfactory during your stay with us, Mr. Cooper?
Audrey, I have no complaints.
When are you leaving? Going fishing.
But you are leaving.
Yes, in effect I am.
So this is it? You save my life, then break my heart?
Audrey, I've explained to you my personal policy about involving...
Yeah, I know, I know. I'm a teenager.
And you were involved in a case I was working on.
Someone must have hurt you once really badly.
No. Someone was hurt by me.
And I will never let that happen again.
What happened, did she die or something?
As a matter of fact, she did.
You wanna know how?
She was a material witness to a federal crime.
We were supposed to protect her.
Twenty-four hours a day.
My partner and I.
Windom Earle was his name.
He taught me everything I know about being a special agent.
And when the attempt on her life was finally made,
I wasn't ready.
Because I loved her.
She died in my arms.
I was badly injured,
and my partner lost his mind.
Need to hear any more?
Audrey, I like you and I care about you.
I'll always consider you my friend.
Friendship is the foundation of any lasting relationship.
It's nice to be quoted accurately.
Well, let me tell you something, Agent Cooper.
One of these days, before you know it,
I'm gonna be grown-up and on my own,
and you better watch out.
Okay, Audrey. It's a deal.
You know, there's only one problem with you.
You're perfect.
It's big.
But it is bad.
Leo just got that suit.
Fits him a little tighter.
Yeah, it's a shame to let good threads go to waste.
What do you think?
Green or yellow?
I gotta look good. Ben Horne is a man who notices these things, you know?
Bobby, honey, you look great.
Can you take me out tonight, please? I'll get all dressed up.
What about Leo? We just leave him here? Heh.
I don't know. I'll get a sitter. I've gotta get out of this house.
Sweetheart, lover, listen to me.
If I land this job with Ben Horne, we're on easy street.
I'll take care of you in ways you never even dreamed of.
Hang in there,
and let Bobby do his thing.
It's for both of us, okay?
I gotta ramble.
Cross your fingers, cross your toes. This is the big time. Whoo!
Later.
Hello, Harry.
Forgive my saying so, Catherine...
...but aren't you dead?
Does Pete know?
My husband and I will be duly reunited.
Well, all things considered, welcome home.
Any questions? Yeah, a couple.
Am I under suspicion?
I guess that depends on the answers I get.
Maybe you'd like to call your lawyer.
That won't be necessary.
I have nothing to hide. Good. Good.
Well, for starters,
where the hell have you been the past two weeks?
Harry.
Do you believe in guardian angels?
Guardian angels?
Catherine, to tell you the truth,
I'm not so sure what I believe these days.
I believe an angel saved my life.
I was home the night of the fire.
A man called. The voice, I didn't recognize.
He asked me to meet him at the drying shed.
There was a vague threat implied. So I went and I took my gun.
And that girl... What's her name?
Shelly Johnson. Johnson. She was there.
She was tied up inside.
I think a bomb went off. I...
I have nothing but impressions after that, just walls of flame, screaming...
I have no idea of how I escaped. But I found myself in the woods.
I was afraid.
I was afraid for the first time in my life.
I dragged myself through the night.
Then, as the sky lightened,
things began to look familiar.
The woods. The path. A rock formation.
And I was...
...flooded with...
...memories of my childhood.
I thought, "This is what heaven is."
And that's when I saw our old summer cabin in the woods.
Heaven was Pearl Lakes. I'd walked miles through the night.
Only a guardian angel could have brought me there.
Thank you.
Thank God we always kept a well-stocked pantry.
I went in and I... I opened a can of tuna fish.
And I waited for whoever it was that was trying to kill me to finish the job.
A loaded gun by my side.
I was terrified that every moment was going to be my last.
What made you come back?
I ran out of tuna fish.
Great news. I quit smoking.
What are you doing here? I wanted to see you.
I wanted...
To be honest, I wanted to talk about our bambino.
Our bambino?
Lucy, I have been in a ghastly turmoil, and do you know what I've discovered?
I, Richard Tremayne, am a terrible, crashing bore.
And what I desperately require in my life is something...
No, someone... more important than myself to think about, to care for.
So perhaps you can see why that, as a result, I must say,
parenthood is suddenly so appealing.
Parenthood? Fatherhood, more specifically.
And since I have no skills in this area...
Nurturing is a relatively foreign concept.
Shh.
I've enlisted myself in the Happy Helping Hand program.
Part-time big brother to some adorable, homeless waif.
Excuse me, are you the same Dick Tremayne
that works at Horne's Department Store?
Yes. And, Lucy, I must say,
I have absolute confidence that the child is mine.
Lucy.
Lucy, Dick, I have something I'd like to say.
What is it, Andy?
I would like to say that we're all in a very difficult position.
I come from a large family. And Mama always said
she couldn't have fussing and fighting around her
when she had a bun in the oven.
And until we know for sure who's gonna be throwing that baseball,
or building that dollhouse, we should all be friends.
So you two go right ahead and talk, and I'll see you.
Andy, are you crazy?
Hawk, I know Lucy and I know what'd get her:
Morals and manly behavior.
You think I went too far?
Harry? Hey.
Well, I guess this is goodbye.
Major Briggs says there's a frying pan full of steelhead trout out there
with my name on them.
That's why I figure you're gonna be needing this.
Harry...
...this is unbelievable. Yeah.
Now, when those steelhead are running upstream,
they're only thinking about one thing. Sex.
A Green Butt Skunk breaks their concentration.
A Green Butt Skunk.
Yeah.
Tied it myself. My dad taught me how.
His dad taught him.
Harry, I don't know what to say.
Oh, one more thing.
I'll recycle this.
Bookhouse Boy patch.
We all agreed. You're one of us now.
Harry, I am honored beyond my ability to express myself.
You wear that in good health.
You ever need us, we'll be there.
Deputy Hawk.
If I'm ever lost, I hope you're the man they send to find me.
May the wind be always at your back.
Deputy Andy.
Your bravery is only exceeded by the size of your heart.
A rare combination, indeed.
Lucy, my best to you and yours.
Now, you better invite me to that wedding,
whoever the lucky man might be.
Sheriff Truman? Yeah.
This is Special Agent Roger Hardy of the FBI.
Roger, what are you doing here?
Dale, we've got a problem.
Effective immediately, without pay,
I regret to inform you of your suspension from the FBI.
Cooper, I suspect you know why I'm here.
I don't. Internal Affairs.
We're the agents who watch the agents.
And his presence refers to my crossing into Canada.
Hold on, that was directly related to a case we were investigating.
Not without my knowing about it, it wasn't.
What's the charge, Roger? Misfeasance?
"Mis" -what?
The improper and unlawful execution of an act
that is in itself proper and lawful.
The rescue of Audrey Horne. In part.
There's also the disturbing allegation as to your motives and your methods.
What allegation?
Well, I'm waiting for some evidence to arrive.
We'll convene in one hour.
Alone.
Come on. Think.
Mr. Horne wasn't expecting you.
He said that possibly we could set something up for you next month.
Could you tell him it's about the tape he got in the mail yesterday,
and it's urgent?
Could you tell him that, please?
A little late for Halloween, isn't it?
What?
Oh, what are you supposed to be, a lounge lizard?
Shouldn't you be in school?
School numbs my buns. What about you?
Oh, I'm just trying to get a meeting with your father.
What on earth do you wanna talk to him about?
A job. Business. It's personal.
Hmm. I didn't know Daddy dearest was hiring.
Oh, you know me. I just gotta talk to him first.
Yeah. You're up to something, Bobby Briggs,
but I'm sure that's none of my business.
Count to ten.
One,
two,
three,
four,
five...
First rule of business is you have to know who to speak to.
Audrey.
I owe you one.
I know you're a busy man, I respect that. I'll get right to the point.
Samantha, bring in a fly swatter.
There's a bug in my office.
Hey! You're making a big mistake. Let me go!
Hey, hey, hey! Leave him alone. He's a friend of mine.
You could tell your boss that that tape was not the original.
You okay? Yeah.
I can't imagine what all this is about, Bobby Briggs.
You know, that's twice you saved my bacon, Audrey.
Could be talking sainthood.
Is there anything I can do for you?
How about an ice cream?
Cup or cone? Mm. Mm.
Cone. I like to lick.
What was the purpose of your first visit to One-Eyed Jack's?
To gather information about the death of Laura Palmer from Jacques Renault.
Who you apparently lured back across the border,
where he was wounded while being arrested,
and subsequently murdered that night in the hospital.
Renault was a material witness to events leading up to Laura's death.
Leland Palmer confessed to Jacques' murder, which I believe he committed.
Am I being held responsible for this, Roger?
Let's talk about your second visit.
To rescue Audrey Horne from her kidnappers.
And both are dead. You know procedure.
Crossing the border without contacting Canadian authorities
is a serious breach under any circumstances.
I'm not disputing that, Roger.
Is it the Bureau's position that I'm responsible for these deaths?
That's what we're trying to determine.
This matter was brought to our attention
because Mountie King was involved in a sting operation
to nail this Jean Renault.
We worked six months to set this up.
One night you march in,
Renault escapes, two men are dead,
and the cocaine we were using for the setup
was stolen from the premises.
I don't know anything about the cocaine, but you've miscounted.
Three people were killed. Jean Renault killed Blackie,
I didn't know about the Battis murder until now,
and the bodyguard who turned his gun on me was killed in self-defense.
So what we have is crossing jurisdictional borders,
three dead bodies and international drug trafficking.
I admit to the border crossing.
I told you the extent of my involvement with the killings.
Roger, I hope you know me better
than to suspect I would have anything to do with a drug transaction.
I won't know that until you prove it, Cooper.
And I might add, the DEA's been brought in to investigate.
You have 24 hours to assemble your defense.
In the meantime, I'll require that you surrender your gun.
And your badge.
Sheriff Truman.
Sheriff, please. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I'll stand.
Well, let me begin by saying
whatever Agent Cooper's guilty of will not be held against you.
And your cooperation will be useful and greatly appreciated.
If I understand the law correctly,
you need extradition papers in order to get a statement from me.
And you need a subpoena from a judge.
Now, unless you gentlemen have that paperwork,
I suggest you take your cooperation...
...and stuff it.
That attitude will not serve you or Agent Cooper.
That's not an attitude. That's a promise.
Agent Cooper is the finest lawman I've ever known.
I've had nothing but respect for him since he arrived in Twin Peaks.
Now, I don't know what information you have
or where you got it from,
but it is dead wrong.
Thank you for your time.
Help yourself to a coffee on the way out.
Steeplejacks, Steeplejacks, roll them!
Too short.
And Nadine.
Nadine Butler.
All right, Nadine. Let's start you off with a little tumbling.
Next event, corkscrew. My gosh. Did you see her do this?
Hold on. I'm gonna throw you.
Yeah, sure, you are.
Corkscrew!
Can you believe that? No, I don't.
I'm not answering that.
All day and not one word.
Johnson's Nursing Home.
That's great, Bobby. I'm glad things went so well.
Must have been the longest meeting in history.
Yeah, I still love you.
Bobby, I've been thinking.
We have to do something with Leo. Put him in a home.
It's not worth it. I don't want the money.
Bobby, I want a life.
He moved.
Bobby...
...Leo moved.
What's with the tablecloths?
The critic has spoken. I feel like a fool.
Norma, pick your lower lip up off the floor. It wasn't that bad.
Mother, please don't tell me how to feel.
This business is all I've got. I wanna keep my regular customers.
I don't care if anyone new ever comes in here again.
They probably won't.
Not after, "If you want local color, stop in.
But if it's good food you want, find a wider berth."
It was "local charm," not "color."
You memorized that piece of trash? No. I wrote it.
You might as well know, so that we can get this little melodrama over with.
I don't believe it.
Is that why you came to visit, so you could run me into the ground?
No. Darling, I wanted to give you a good review.
This is just not a good restaurant.
I can't violate my professional ethics.
Ethics?
I'm your daughter.
Some standards have to prevail.
What about the standards of common decency and kindness?
Or don't those standards fit into your profession?
Of course they do.
I wouldn't treat a dog like this, no less my own daughter.
Oh, as usual you're overreacting.
Am I? Mm-hm.
Maybe I am,
but they're my reactions.
And the hurt I feel is my hurt,
and how I react is none of your damn business.
Dear, be sensible. I'm being very sensible.
I want you out of this place.
I want you out of my life. I don't wanna be hurt by you anymore.
Norma.
Goodbye.
Go.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yes. Oh, yeah.
Okay, kids, come on, we'll take you another time.
Go on, go. Whoo, whoo.
Whoa. We bagged our limit and we didn't even fire a shot.
Get off me, man. Welcome to the fighter zone.
I remind you. What?
I'm a happily married man. Recently married.
To an extremely wealthy woman.
As we discussed, we're really eager to do business with you.
Look, I will not steal my wife's money.
I feel guilty enough about lying to her about this hunting trip.
Hey, no harm, no foul. Get off.
She bought it, didn't she? I don't know. She doesn't miss much.
And I don't like this stealing business.
Stealing? Who said anything about stealing?
I've had enough of this. You're the computer expert, buddy.
Just hit the keys, and she won't see a ripple.
Look at it this way. Get off.
You don't help us, how long you think she'll stay your wife?
I'm getting mad. You want me to release you?
Hold it or I'll have to kill you.
You better get with the program, pal.
Get off.
So this is him?
Ernie,
meet Jean Renault. Hi.
I met him one night in the woods, when he stuck a pistol in my ear.
Lucky for me, I had my state prosecutor's badge with me.
Never leave home without it.
Jean, this is the Professor.
What he can do with numbers would make a 1000-dollar-a-night hooker
blush like a nun. Ah.
Well, a recent investment opportunity fell through,
leave us in a cash-poor position.
We need 125,000 immediately.
I understand completely.
You do? Yeah, this will not be difficult.
Just so you know a little bit more about me,
I've been associated
with some of the most prestigious financial institutions in this country.
I've laundered massive amounts of money.
I've brokered tremendous deals for the Colombian
and the Bolivian industries.
In other words, I'm wired in, okay? I mean, I'm hardwired.
I'm your man. Definitely. I'm definitely your man. Yeah.
Well, you say the magic words. Good.
Nicely done, Ernie. Are you making this up?
No, no.
This is the Professor, our new broker.
Hi.
You can handle a puny little bundle like this, can't you?
Yes, he can take care of it for us, can't you?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hank, take the Professor down to the tables.
I understand you have a very good system
for the craps and roulette.
Very scientific, eh?
I don't gamble anymore. I used to, but I don't gamble anymore.
It's a mug's game, you know? Mm. Tsk, tsk, tsk. No.
We all gamble here. Ah.
You must enjoy life.
Yeah, I'll try it. Thank you. Yes. Come on.
Come on. Let's go.
I don't like the look of him. Too nervous.
We'll see, won't we?
Four for us, and just a little to put the last nail in Cooper's coffin.
I'll call you when I'm done. Where will you put it?
The car.
Won't take much, just a trace of this.
I want him crucified.
Oh... Josie. Josie.
Help me, Harry.
At the time, I did what I thought was right.
I must now face the consequences.
You can do no more.
You know, major, I find myself thinking a lot about Bob.
If he truly exists.
I've pondered that same question continuously
since this horror was revealed to us.
I try to imagine him out there incarnate,
looking for another victim to inhabit.
There are powerful forces of evil.
It is some men's fate to face great darkness.
We each choose how to react.
If the choice is fear,
then we become vulnerable to darkness.
There are ways to resist.
You, sir, were blessed with certain gifts.
In this respect, you're not alone.
Have you ever heard of the White Lodge?
The White Lodge?
No, I don't believe I have.
Major, I'm gonna take a moment here.
I feel the call of nature.
There's nothing quite like urinating out in the open air.
I look forward to hearing more about this White Lodge.
When I return from my journey.
Cooper!
Major Briggs?
Major!
﻿1
I don't wanna alarm you but Garland has disappeared before.
Granted it's always been work-related.
Agent Cooper, did this seem work-related?
Ma'am, that's hard to say. Mm.
So, Betty, you're saying this behavior is part of the way the major operates.
Let me ask you this.
Did he leave suddenly?
Yes, he did.
We were speaking philosophically,
and I left the campsite to answer the call of nature.
When I returned he was gone.
The fact that you were in the woods is very significant.
In what way?
Confidentially,
he talks about them constantly.
Ma'am, has the major, uh...
Clearly, a man of no small spiritual advancement.
Been attempting to contact some element that lives in the woods
as a part of his top-secret work?
That's classified.
Well, he certainly has a renaissance passion for exploration, doesn't he?
That is how he sees himself.
And there's no manual for it.
There's certainly no manual to be married to it.
Betty, thanks for coming in.
I guess there's not much more we can do right now,
except, keep our eyes peeled.
Uh, Garland left some notes on his bedside table.
I can call you back with them.
They might be very helpful.
Harry, the major didn't just wander off on some work-related assignment.
That flash of light I saw, it's a powerful force that exists in those woods.
Sheriff, we found Mr. and Mrs. Milford's wedding present.
It's a matching scarf and ascot set.
Good. I still owe him a gift from last time.
I can't believe that he's getting married again.
Dougie's weddings are a seasonal thing. Like the return of the salmon.
Marry in haste, repent in leisure.
Hello, sheriff?
There's a call for a Dale Crewper.
Long distance. I hope I didn't cut it off.
Temp. Lucy's helping out with the Milford wedding.
Hmm. Coop?
Where are we?
This is Gordon Cole calling from Bend, Oregon.
How are you doing, Gordon?
Coop, I just called to say that you have my full support
in this investigation business.
These are hard times but we get through them.
Thank you, Gordon. It ranks poor with me too.
Now, Coop, is any of this true?
Double homicide?
Stolen drugs?
Storming a whorehouse?
It's all a bunch of hogwash.
I have to tell you the Drug Enforcement Agency
is starting to nose around.
They're sending down a top dog to investigate the drug angle.
Who are they sending?
It's Gordon.
It's Gordon Cole.
Who's the agent? Oh!
Dennis Bryson.
It's Bryson. He's a good man, Harry. No nonsense.
Don't let him rattle you, Coop.
These guys make a living looking through other people's drawers.
We've all had our socks tossed around.
From time to time.
Couple of words of advice:
Let a smile be your umbrella.
Thanks, Gordon. See you, Coop.
Well, Harry...
...time to face the music.
Good morning, Roger.
Gentlemen.
Agent Cooper.
It's showtime.
You've heard the charges.
What do you wish to present as your defense?
I have no defense.
I am completely confident in the rightness of my actions.
Some of it occurred outside of Bureau guidelines, I will pay the price for that.
But I'm innocent of any criminal wrongdoing.
If they wish to charge me, I will defend myself in a court of law.
Dale.
There's a right way and a wrong way to do this.
And the first thing we expect
is a Bureau man to stand up for himself.
A man who can't, who doesn't even try,
well, he may be packing feathers where his spine is supposed to be.
Roger.
I know the moves I'm supposed to make.
And I know the board.
So.
I've been doing a lot of thinking lately.
And I've started to focus out beyond the edge of the board.
At a bigger game.
What game?
The sound wind makes through the pines.
The sentience of animals.
What we fear in the dark and what lies beyond the darkness.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about seeing beyond fear, Roger.
About looking at the world with love.
They're liable to extradite you for murder and drug trafficking.
These are things I cannot control.
The suspension will remain in force.
The next move is up to the Canadian government
and the DEA investigation which begins today.
You've cracked a big case.
You've been under a lot of pressure.
I may recommend
a full psychological workup.
Thanks for your candor, Roger.
So long, fellas.
Donna, hi.
Hi, Nadine.
Have you heard anything from James?
You mean, Eddie's friend with the motorcycle?
Yeah.
He hasn't been around for a couple of days.
Listen,
I gotta ask you something and I hope you don't think this is too personal.
What?
Well, are you still, like, going out with Mike or anything?
No.
Yay!
Why? You have to promise not to say.
Promise, okay? Sure.
Well, I think there may be some major chemistry developing bet...
Oh, my God, there he is.
Hi, Donna.
Hi, Mike.
He has the cutest buns.
Nadine, what about Ed?
Aren't you still seeing him?
Yeah, sort of.
Well, if you're still seeing Ed, then how can you...
...how can you start seeing Mike?
Well, Eddie stays home and Mike's at school.
Eddie likes to stay in, Mike likes to go out.
And let's be realistic, sometimes Eddie acts like
he's old enough to be my father.
I'll catch you later.
Could I get a beer?
Hi. Hello.
Headed somewhere?
I'm sorry?
Is there some place you're going to or running from?
You got the wrong guy. I'm all right.
Men are always all right.
Right up until they pull the trigger.
And then we watch the neighbors solemnly march out
to the news cameras to tell us:
"He was such a nice, quiet guy."
Well, I'm only quiet on the outside.
I can almost hear what's inside from here.
Live nearby?
Yeah, Twin Peaks.
It's a nice jacket.
I'm glad you think so.
Look, can you do anything with cars? Yeah.
Why, you got a problem with the 'Vette outside?
No. No, it's my husband's Jaguar.
Somebody squeezed me on the highway, and I drove it to a ditch.
I think it would be a very good idea to have it repaired before he gets home.
Well, I could take a look at it.
My name is James.
Evelyn.
Evelyn Marsh. I live right up the road.
Well, are we in a hurry?
Do you mind if I play the box first?
I don't exactly punch a clock myself.
Good day, Dick.
Hello, Andy.
This is little Nicky, my charge from Happy Helping Hand.
Nicky, this is Deputy Andy.
How do you do, young fella?
Hi. Heh, heh.
Andrew, old boy.
Little Nicky and myself, we just came from Horne's Department Store
where Nicky was fitted for a new wardrobe.
And now we're on our way for a malted.
We were hoping Lucy could come with us.
Oh, shoot, Dick. Lucy's up at the Great Northern,
helping with the Milford wedding.
Oh, God, that's right.
Dougie's getting married again.
Lucy's not here?
Does this mean we can't go out for a malted?
Yes, unfortunately. We'll have to go some other time.
But you promised. Can't we go? Ah... Nicky. Ha-ha-ha.
You know, Dick,
it's close to my lunch hour.
If you'd like, Nicky, I'd sure enjoy taking you two guys out for a malted.
How would that be? Oh, boy.
So, what will you do
if we can't figure a way to get you cleared?
Well, Harry, the Giant said a path is formed by laying one stone at a time.
Have either of you fellas heard of a place called the White Lodge?
Where did you hear of it?
Well, it was the last thing Major Briggs said to me before he disappeared.
Cooper, you may be fearless in this world.
But there are other worlds.
Tell me more.
My people believe that the White Lodge is a place
where the spirits that rule man and nature here reside.
Local legend. Goes way back.
There is also a legend of a place called the Black Lodge,
the shadow self of the White Lodge.
Legend says that every spirit must pass through there
on a way to perfection.
There, you will meet your own shadow self.
My people call it: The Dweller on the Threshold.
Dweller on the Threshold.
But it is said, if you confront the Black Lodge with imperfect courage,
it will utterly annihilate your soul.
Agent Cooper,
Agent Bryson's here to see you.
Send him right in.
Dennis Bryson and I worked together in Oakland.
One of the finest minds in the DEA. Harry, we're in very good hands.
Coop.
Dennis?
It's a long story, but actually I prefer Denise if you don't mind.
Okay.
Sheriff Truman.
Pleased. Deputy Hawk.
Denise Bryson, Drug Enforcement Agency.
Well, I had a nice ride out here, sheriff.
It's hard to imagine you have even any crime.
I picture you chasing lost dogs, and locking up the town drunk.
Unfortunately, it's a little more involved than that.
Hmm.
Let's get right to this, Dale.
The DEA's interest in you stems from allegations made by an RCMP officer
that you stole drugs being used by him in a sting operation.
Denise, I believe I'm being set up.
Well, my recent experiences taught me never to judge too quickly.
Anyway, I'll get right to this
and get back to you later. Okay.
I understand we're both staying at the Great Northern.
How is the food up there?
Denise, you're in for a real surprise.
So are they.
Well, we'll catch up later.
I wanna tell you all about my new life. Anxious to hear about it.
It's a pleasure to meet you, sheriff.
Mm.
Deputy.
That's a good color for him.
Look, is there something you want?
Why, Mike.
Aren't we being a little forward?
Come on, guys. I wanna hear some grunting and see some sweat.
Attaboy, Nelson. Come on, pump it.
Pump it.
Hey, what's your name, little lady? Nadine Butler.
Well, Nadine, ever give any thoughts of going out for the wrestling team?
Josie.
It's time.
I can't be with you unless I know.
Oh, Harry. The truth.
The truth.
I used to... work for a man in Hong Kong.
His name is Thomas Eckhardt.
He helped me.
Took me off the streets when I was 16.
We are from a poor family.
Sometimes they sell their female children.
I was lucky.
He taught me about life...
...about business.
He was my father.
My master.
My lover.
When I met Andrew Packard,
I was already afraid for my life.
Andrew was also a business partner.
When Andrew asked me to marry him,
I said yes.
Who was this Mr. Lee?
Who is this... this cousin?
I'm sorry, Harry.
I was just trying to keep you out of this.
The less you know, the better. Who was he?
He works for Eckhardt.
He said if I didn't go back with him, he'd kill you.
Why?
Because Eckhardt wants me.
He's never stopped wanting me. He thinks I'm his property.
When Andrew was alive, he could protect me.
I now believe...
...Eckhardt is the man responsible for Andrew's death.
We were... We were in the airport in Seattle.
And I just escaped.
I'd rather die.
I'd rather die than go back to that monster.
Josie.
Josie, you will never have to go back there.
You're with me now...
And now...
...he'll kill the both of us.
No.
Let him try.
Sorry, it took so long,
but we're short on help today. That's quite all right.
I've been looking forward to this pie. I've heard so much about it.
You won't be disappointed.
Hey, I... I'll get you anything you want. Just sit down.
Hey, sweetheart. Could we get some coffee?
How was your hunting expedition? It was a little fatiguing.
Catch anything? I hope not.
Oh, catch anything. Uh...
Yeah, I...
I came across a 12-point buck, you know, standing by a deepwater pool.
So, uh, I made this very soft approach and I lined him up dead center: Pow!
You should have had your camera.
Are you having it mounted?
Oh, yeah, yeah, even as we speak. It was great, just great. Um...
I think I better go and check on your mama.
She's not here, Ernie. She's gone back to Seattle.
Seattle?
And that's where I think you should go too.
Hey, buddy, what's with the long face?
Vivian's gone back to Seattle. Better for you, buckeroo.
We got four kilos to unload. You want the ball-and-chain getting in the way?
Yeah, I suppose you are right.
There's the phone, hotrod.
We're on a deadline.
Here we go. Two three-berry pies
and one super snow frost chocolate malted.
Wow, thanks.
Looks just like Whitetail Mountain, doesn't it, Nicky?
How much does it cost?
Oh, money is no object, little Nicholas. Ha-ha-ha.
Aah! Damn. Damn.
Damn.
Sorry, Uncle Dick.
It's okay, Nicky.
Uncle Dick isn't mad. Are you, Uncle Dick?
Uncle Dick is simply ripping, thank you. Pass me a napkin, Uncle Andy.
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.
Gosh darn it, anyway.
Sorry, Uncle Andy.
Think nothing of it, little Nicky.
Uncle Andy went funny boom-boom, didn't he?
I think I can put this right.
It is beautiful.
Jeffrey loves this car.
My husband.
He loves this car.
Where is your husband, Mrs. Marsh?
I don't know this week.
He travels extensively.
Business.
This car was built in 1948.
Jeffrey has to have the most unique and beautiful toys.
They have to be perfect.
He's that way about everything he owns.
I could have learned something from that if I'd been paying attention.
Are you that way, James?
Are you that way about your bike?
I guess I'm not so interested in how my bike looks
as I am in where it can take me.
Where do you wanna go?
It's not really a place, it's a feeling.
Sometimes, riding at night...
...I punch off the headlights and roll on the throttle...
...and just rocket blind into the dark.
So...
...do you think you could fix it?
Yeah.
There's a room above the garage.
You can stay there if you like while you work.
Room and board and anything else you think is fair.
I really do need to have this fixed before Jeffrey gets home.
I'd like you to stay, James.
I'd enjoy the company.
Okay.
Good.
It's settled then. I'll leave you to it.
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
A stag party?
And I wasn't even invited?
Where the hell have you been?
Ben, I have had an absolutely killer schedule.
Do you know the kind of hell that I have been through
in the last few days?
You said that you took care of Catherine in the mill fire.
She's alive.
And as you might imagine, not a happy camper.
Through trickery...
...extortion...
She has managed to cheat me out of both.
Both Ghostwood and the mill.
Then there is the, uh...
...small matter of being arrested for the killing of...
...Laura Palmer.
A real business-enhancer.
On top of which, my trusted solicitor, the late Leland Palmer...
...turns out to be a homicidal lunatic.
Tough week, Ben.
Do you think the furniture in this room is adequately arranged?
I have been toying with the notion
that if one could find
the perfect arrangement of all objects in any particular space,
it could create a resonance the benefits from which
to the individual dwelling in that space could be, uh...
...could be extensive, could be far-reaching, far-reaching.
Would you help me with this desk?
That's fascinating, Ben, really.
Listen, though, what we have to talk about now...
...is One-Eyed Jack's.
Jack's, Jack's. Yes, One-Eyed Jack's.
Look, here's how it is, Ben.
Ben.
You're out.
Excuse me?
I own One-Eyed Jack's.
There's been a friendly takeover.
You come in here under my employ and have the gall to tell me...
Oh, that's another thing.
I don't work for you anymore.
Renault.
Jean Renault.
It's Renault, isn't it? Hank.
Let me tell you something.
The guy is a psychopath.
Psychopath.
And you, my friend, are dancing with the devil.
Ben, you're a nut.
You think I'm just gonna sit here?
Mm? Let you take all this.
Ben.
Life is change.
I want you to listen to me when I tell you that this is how it's gonna be.
Don't patronize me, you goon.
You're a mess, Ben. Look at you.
You screwed up, boss man.
You're out, Ben.
"You're out, Ben.
You're out, Ben. Ha-ha-ha!
Mm!
You're out. Ben, you're out.
Ben, you're out."
Windom Earle.
Of course, you couldn't help but take note of
my emphatically traditional opening.
I must say, your responding move was nothing
if not reflective of your predilection for the tidy and fastidious.
See how my response to you begins to lead us
towards a classical confrontation?
But there's doubt in your mind.
What are my true intentions?
How will you answer this time?
Hobgoblins, Dale.
Consistency, predictability, giving rise to patterns.
We both know only too well
how these patterns leave you vulnerable to attack.
You with your wounds.
I with mine.
Let me paint you a picture.
My knights will skirmish.
Lanes of power and influence will open to my bishops and rooks.
Pawns will naturally be forfeit.
I'm even prepared to sacrifice my queen because I assure you,
dear Dale, my goal will be attained at any cost.
The king must die.
Do you, Douglas Milford, take this woman to be your wife...
...to love and to cherish, for as long as you both shall live?
You bet, I do, Reverend.
If there be anyone who knows not why this union should be made,
let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
You're damn right. I want to object.
This little gold digger just wants his money,
and his publishing empire,
and God knows what all.
And look at him,
he's got one foot in the grave already. Ha-ha-ha.
Okay, Dwayne, okay, just take her easy.
Take her easy. All right.
You know that I have had problems, sheriff. All these years.
Okay, Mr. Mayor, let's just get a little air. Shall we?
It's pretty peculiar, isn't it?
Don't give it another thought, doll.
Well, I know this is my opinion, Let's get out, let's just get out.
And I want you to all understand it. Excuse us.
Marrying every two months... Good God.
So if there be no further objections...
Cooper here.
Denise.
Well, that'll be nice. I'll be right down.
Diane, when I've got a moment,
remind me to tell you about Agent Bryson.
I just love Milford weddings.
Unfair advantage.
How many of those girls were varsity wide receivers?
Very few.
Bad news first.
I found cocaine residue in your car.
And my guess is it will match the lot stolen from the Mountie.
Dennis, this can't appear straight. Denise.
Sorry. It's okay.
Sure it looks like a frame, Coop.
But I'm gonna need more than your opinion to make that stick.
Can you help me?
Well, that gets into a very delicate area.
But on the other hand, I'm trying very hard, recently,
to get more in touch with my feelings.
Ladies and gentlemen, the cake.
Dougie's always been a sucker.
Let a woman pass...
...with play in her eyes...
...and Jell-O in her walk, and he's a trout on a hook. Ha-ha-ha.
So, Denise,
if you don't mind my asking,
what happened to you? No, not at all.
I like to talk about it.
It's really very simple.
Last year, I was working undercover suburban surveillance
and the seller had a few kinks in his rep.
It seems that he'd only sell to transvestites.
So my partner and I shacked up.
I played the part of the buyer.
And I found that wearing women's clothes...
...relaxed me.
I continued wearing them into the night.
My partner thought it was my consummate professionalism. Heh.
It was a very confusing two weeks.
Well, this is all a pretty amazing disclosure,
Denise.
Imagine how surprised I was, Coop.
This is not exactly something you plan on.
Guess not.
Sheriff. Harry.
I'll have a draft.
Sheriff, arrest this woman.
She's too beautiful to be living in this state.
Oh, hey, aren't you that FBI man?
Not currently, no.
Dale Cooper.
Dale.
You solved that Laura Palmer case, huh?
Come on, darling, they're playing our tune. See you.
I sure hope those two go up to the honeymoon suite soon.
We've had to separate Dwayne and Dougie twice already.
Happens every wedding.
Boys will be boys.
I was married to the same woman for half a century.
God rest her soul.
That's because I used my brain for thinking, not my garden hose.
This cake is delicious.
The music...
...turned out pretty good.
It ought have been the death march. Ha, ha.
You're an excellent dancer.
The wonderful thing about dancing, Audrey,
is that you never know where the step could lead.
You have to hang on and hope the music takes you there.
Your brother, my husband, Andrew Packard,
was killed by a man named Thomas Eckhardt.
Tell me something I don't already know.
You're in terrible danger, Catherine.
You helped kill my brother,
tried to cheat me out of my land, my family's lifeblood,
utterly destroy my existence, and now you want to save me?
I had to do these things to stay alive.
I have no one to turn to now.
I've got nothing.
And I'm at your mercy.
Oh.
Now...
...enough.
Let's be practical.
What do you propose we do?
I don't know.
Then I'll tell you.
From now on...
...you work for me.
Here.
At the house.
As a maid.
You move your things into the servant's quarters.
If you disobey me,
if you lie to me,
if you contradict a single thing I tell you,
I shall find this Eckhardt
and feed you to him by hand.
Is that clear?
Speak!
Yes, I understand.
Fine.
We'll talk about this Eckhardt some other time.
You may go to your room.
Thank you.
Josie...
I'll take breakfast at 7 in my room.
Coffee, juice, dry toast, oatmeal.
Yes. Sweet dreams.
Happy, Andrew?
Everything is going exactly as we planned.
And now?
And now, dear sister, we wait for Thomas Eckhardt
to come looking for his one true love.
And when he does...
We'll be waiting for him.
﻿1
Mr. Horne?
Your secretary said to come in.
Bobby Briggs.
Bobby, you know what you have to have in this life?
Hmm?
Balance.
Distance.
Symmetry.
Look.
It's a beautiful thing, isn't it? Hmm?
Uh, Mr. Horne, did you listen to that tape that I sent you?
Yes, I listened to your tape, Bobby.
Frankly, I am surprised that Leo could master the technology.
Damn it, Bobby, what do you want? Huh?
Mr. Horne, I have a great admiration for you.
Admiration is for poets and dairy cows, Bobby.
I don't know what you mean. I, uh...
Bobby.
You're standing in front of a mammoth skyscraper.
A leviathan that rips a hole in the clouds.
Now, what's the first question that comes to your mind?
Um...
The first question that you ask yourself is, "What's on the top floor?"
"Who's up there in the penthouse, and why?"
Now, that's who I am.
Are you?
Yeah, of course I am. Yes.
Bobby, opportunity knocks.
I want you to follow Hank Jennings.
I want you to chronicle his existence.
Show me something that I don't already know.
Hmm.
I'd like to see both.
Very good. Which one would you like to see first?
Well...
What is this?
I'd thought I'd taken that out.
That property is called Dead Dog Farm.
And it's worse than it sounds.
What is it? A puzzle.
No one ever really stays there long.
When can I see it?
Sorry I'm late.
But the little nipper is so excited about our camping trip,
I just couldn't coax him out of the car. Heh.
Richard, this is Judy Swain
from the Happy Helping Hands organization.
I'm little Nicky's case manager.
Charmed, I'm sure. Shall we?
Sit down.
Okay. Ahem.
Um...
As I was about to tell your, uh, friends,
the number one thing to know about Nicky
is that throughout his brief life, he has been very confused,
and perhaps traumatized by a persistent random misfortune.
Looks like he's bounced around quite a bit.
Well, yes, he has.
Poor child. Yes.
An orphan, you know.
Really? What happened? Did his parents die?
Nicely deduced, Andrew.
Persistent random misfortune?
Uh, they were killed.
How were they killed, Miss Swain?
Mysterious circumstances.
I'm afraid the, uh, orphanage has never provided us with that information.
Andy, let's go. Emergency up at the Great Northern.
Looks like a heart attack.
Once stimulated, the female will respond in such a way
that the skin around her... Oh, my God.
Looks like Dougie went out with his boots on.
Love Poems of Lord Byron, The Kama Sutra,
Hookers and Handmaidens.
Sheriff, look at this.
What a falling out was here.
Doug.
Lord, I hate to say it, I told you so.
Here, sheriff.
This is it.
The murder weapon.
She might as well have blown his brains out with a rifle.
He never could say no to a woman.
You old fool.
You sexual adventuress, you'll burn in hell for this.
Take it easy, mister. I'm gonna shout till I wake the dead.
She murdered my brother.
She's a witch.
He's right, I'm cursed.
Don't be silly.
No, no, it's true.
It all started in high school, prom night.
My date went to kiss me.
It was his first day with his new braces.
Oh, and they gleamed in the moonlight.
And his rubber band snapped and his jaw locked open,
and we ended up in the emergency room,
and the doctors had to break his jaw in three places to get it to shut.
And it's just gotten worse ever since.
A curse needs a cure.
I know a bit about these things.
Are you the sheriff?
Let's just say, when something really big goes down, I'm the man.
Boys, there's a story about a great football coach,
whose name escapes me at this time,
who was dead set against having any black players on his team.
Until somebody brought him the finest black halfback anyone had ever seen.
And when what's-his-name saw him run 50 yards
and no one lay a hand on him,
he shouted, "Look at that Indian go!"
That coach accepted that athlete's desire to compete.
Nadine.
And today, this story applies to this woman's...
This young girl's right to compete.
In addition to it being her moral and constitutional right.
Mike Nelson, could you step up here for a second?
Come on, Mike, go.
Now, Nadine has chosen to prove herself to us
by taking on our very best.
Our very own district champion, Mike Nelson.
Yeah! Come on. Come on. All right, man.
Go, Mike.
Hi, Mike.
Oh! Put your hand here.
No, here.
All right, now just push against me. I'll try not to hurt you.
Wanna go out tonight?
This is called a tie.
Oh, yeah. You stupid...
What did you say, Mike?
Neck, you're breaking my neck.
You're right, this is sort of like necking.
Agh.
What about tonight?
Coach?
Hey, coach?
Get up, Mike. Oh, my God.
One, two and three.
Now will you go out with me?
What happened to you?
I got beat up by a girl.
What did you do to her?
Donna, I'm not kidding. Now, you've gotta help me.
It's bad enough getting stomped on in front of the whole team,
but she likes me.
Who? Mrs. Hurley.
Nadine?
It's not funny.
I don't know, maybe an older woman is just what you need.
I don't wanna go out with anyone who can body-slam me.
Well, what do you want me to do about it?
I don't know, talk to her or something. Pretend you're still my girlfriend.
Sorry, Mike, I'm not that good of an actress.
Donna, this is serious. I'm gonna end up in traction.
May I help you?
Hang up a local service rebellion,
wonder if you'd help me bundle up loose sticks and burn that master.
Malcolm, Malcolm Sloan, as in brother to Evelyn.
Mr. Marsh's driver, as in, "Bring that car around, James."
So how badly did she damage the Jag?
It's repairable.
That's the nice thing about things.
You know, when she and Jeffrey fell in love,
he gave her a whole new life.
That's for sure.
Now I got a nice uniform, and the keys to the liquor cabinet.
God, I hope I don't sound ungrateful,
because compared to the life I was living,
wanton dissipation is a step up.
And Evelyn, she learned a lot herself.
Defensive postures, masking bruises, vicious cycles.
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, am I being obscure?
Once a fortnight, Jeffrey pounds her mercilessly,
and she tries to get even by breaking one of his things.
It only perpetuates the cycle.
She's your sister. Why don't you stop him?
Sonny boy, nobody stops Mr. Marsh.
That's a golden rule around here.
You can jot that down and put it under your pillow.
I gotta get back.
Hey, thanks.
I mean that.
Well, it's still standing.
Almost by force of habit.
Well, habit can provide a strong foundation.
Dead Dog Farm, huh?
That's an old legend. Of all the people in the world,
the best and the worst are drawn to Dead Dog,
and most turn away.
Only those with the purest of heart can feel its pain.
And somewhere in between, the rest of us struggle.
Irene, have you shown this property to anyone else recently?
I don't think anyone's asked to see it this last year.
There's three vehicles.
A jeep, a four-wheeler and a luxury sedan.
It's open.
Hello?
There's been a meeting here. In the past few hours.
What are you seeing?
They forgot there was no running water.
Baby laxative.
More white powder. Mm.
Cocaine.
Irene, we have to notify the sheriff.
Nicky, stop that, please.
Nicky, stop it.
I don't understand this at all.
I just had the car checked at Gas Farm.
He told me it was in perfect working order.
Perfect working order.
This is all so technical.
Please, Nicky, Uncle Dick is trying to read.
Nicholas, get out of the car!
Nicholas, out of the car, right now!
Out of the car!
Do you hear me?
Are you mad at me, Uncle Dick?
Well, of course I'm not mad at you. Why should I be mad at you?
Scared you, didn't I? Ha-ha-ha.
Uncle Dick!
Don't worry, don't worry, I'm all right, little Nicky.
What if you died? You aren't gonna die, are you?
Of course not. Don't be silly.
Harry?
Cooper. This is Colonel Riley.
He's heading up the Air Force's investigation
into Briggs' disappearance.
Colonel. Cooper.
You were with Briggs when we lost our coordinates on him.
Yes, I was.
When you were at the site, did you notice any wildlife in the area?
Wildlife? Birds, owls?
Yes.
Yes, just moments before the major disappeared, I heard an owl.
Any visual contact?
Look, colonel, Garland Briggs is a good friend of mine.
It would be a lot better if you'd just level with us.
We know about the monitors and the messages from deep space
that you received pertaining to me.
You may know something, but you best get your facts straight.
Our monitors are pointed at deep space,
but the messages we intercepted that Briggs showed you
were sent from right here in these woods.
Now, where they were sent to is another question.
Might this have something to do with a place called the White Lodge?
That's classified.
Colonel, we'd like to help you,
but you need to give us a little more to go on here.
Garland Briggs is the best pilot I've ever known.
He was born with hardware most of us only dream about.
I can tell you this:
His disappearance has implications that go so far beyond national security
the Cold War seems like a case of the sniffles.
The engine's fine, the axle should be okay.
How did you get so good at this?
Oh, my uncle Ed.
You think I'm good, you should see him.
He can fix anything.
I was, uh, talking to your brother today a little bit about your situation.
Look, James, mind your own business.
Are you afraid?
Are you afraid of your husband?
Are you?
There's nothing to talk about.
I know what it's like to be alone.
You are afraid of him, aren't you?
Why don't you just leave?
It's complicated.
Oh, my God, it's him.
I've gotta go.
It's not as bad as I made it out to be.
Oh, look who's here. Did Daddy have a change of heart?
Daddy just made the smartest decision that he's made all year.
Oh, yeah? That's not saying much. What did he do?
He put me on the payroll. Ha-ha-ha.
Bobby, you junior achiever, you.
And, uh, this right here?
This is my first assignment. Ah.
Anything I can help you with?
Maybe.
Maybe you can help me celebrate
after I show this to the boss.
Well, you know what I think, Bobby Briggs?
Tell.
I think that we should think
about doing business together.
Audrey, I like the way you think.
Thank you.
Hey, Mr. Horne, how's it going?
What, uh...? What is this you're doing here, exactly?
Gettysburg, day one.
The South is winning.
I followed Hank, got those pictures you wanted.
You see, I don't know what he's up to, but I'm sure it's no good.
I mean, I've never seen these guys before,
but they're not exactly from the Rotary, if you know what I mean.
I like you, Bobby. Oh, I like you too.
How much am I paying you?
Uh...
We haven't actually discussed money.
Well, you can consider this your first raise.
Now, you come back tomorrow, and we will discuss a full-time position.
Thank you, Ben. I won't let you down.
Oh!
Nectar of the gods, my dear.
It's the bubbles.
Wine comes in at the mouth.
Love comes in at the eye.
I touch my glass to my lips, I look at you and sigh.
Thank you, Pete.
That's very lyrical.
It's Yeats.
He's a poet.
Yes, I know.
The only other toast I know is a limerick.
No, really. Really, Pete, that was...
There once was a lady from Galway... Josie!
Yes. We'll have our appetizers now.
Yes. Oh, Josie.
I just want you to know
that even though your station in this household has changed,
I intend to show you all the respect and affection that you deserve.
Thank you, Catherine. And I will try to do the same.
Oh, and put on your little maid's cap.
Catherine, uh, don't you think maybe you're being a little hard on her?
I mean, she is still part of the family.
Josie had a hand in Andrew's death,
and she did everything in her power to destroy me.
She is lucky she's not hanging from a tree.
I don't believe it.
Not the Josie I know.
I would like to propose a toast to Ben Horne's double-cross.
Here's to Josie Packard's dirty deeds.
And here's to the woman who brought them down.
Here's to me.
Here's to you, poodle.
Diane, I'm holding in my hand a nationally distributed newspaper.
My opening move, responding to Windom Earle's opening move,
was printed in the personal columns per my instructions.
But I've already received his response to this yesterday.
He anticipated my response to his opening move perfectly.
He's toying with me, Diane.
I wonder where he is and what he's planning.
Meanwhile, I've spent the past two days
without badge and gun the best way I know how:
Occupying both body and spirit.
Looked into some real estate,
what the local agent charitably refers to as a fixer-upper.
Nonetheless, it's a place where a man might make a home,
raise a family, which is something, in spite of my past,
I still hope I'm able to do.
However, as is the case here in Twin Peaks,
even this bucolic hideaway is filled with secrets.
Secrets that may be connected to my trouble at the Bureau
and the cocaine that was found in my automobile.
Agent Hardy's deliberations will soon be completed.
And if I'm not adequately able to defend myself,
there's a very real possibility of imprisonment.
Hello, Agent Cooper. Audrey.
This is for you. I stole it.
Don't you think you'd better give it back?
Not until you look at what's inside.
Okay.
What am I gonna find in here, Audrey?
Pictures my father paid for.
I did good, didn't I?
Audrey, you did better than good.
You may have saved my life.
Good.
So that makes us even now, right?
Denise. Hi, Coop.
Come in.
Sorry, am I interrupting something?
Special Agent Denise Bryson, Drug Enforcement Agency.
This is a very good friend of mine, Audrey Horne.
They have women agents?
More or less.
Audrey, if you'll excuse us. Agency business.
I thought you were suspended.
I am.
Thanks again. Good night.
Thank you. Heh. You're welcome. Ha, ha.
These are photographs of an abandoned property
on the outskirts of town.
Jean Renault, Hank Jennings,
Norma Jennings' stepfather, Sergeant King, mounted police.
They were at the scene earlier today.
In the kitchen I found traces of cocaine and the baby laxative used to step it up.
I think if you compare this, which was taken from the farm,
with the stuff found in my automobile, you'll find it to be a match.
That's good news, Coop. Yeah.
Now, can we talk about something more important?
Exactly how old is that girl?
Denise, I would assume you're no longer interested in girls.
Coop, I may be wearing a dress,
but I still pull my panties on one leg at a time, if you know what I mean.
Not really.
You gonna eat that pie or just push it around on my china?
I guess I ain't all that hungry.
Wanna talk about it?
Oh, you don't wanna hear my problems.
We used to talk about everything.
We can still talk, Ed.
Remember when we were kids, all those plans we made?
It was like, uh, we were just waiting around for our lives to begin,
planning all that stuff we'd do when we did.
Somehow, life starts before you know it.
Suddenly, you're halfway through living it, and all those plans,
they just don't mean a damn thing.
This is my life, Norma. I just don't like it much.
We can make new plans.
Andrew.
What is it, Dick?
May I have a word with you?
Sure.
I feel we may have a problem.
What problem?
It's our mutual friend, little Nicky.
Yes? How shall I put this?
Well, he's, he's...
Andy, I believe that little Nicky, incredible as it may seem,
may in fact be the devil.
Devil?
Or at the very least, homicidal in the first degree.
Andy, we've got to find out what happened to his parents.
I've got the, uh, autopsy report.
Dwayne, Dougie died of natural causes. Heart attack.
No evidence of foul play.
Hmm. Mm-mm.
Did you check him for witchcraft? Uh-huh.
That's, uh, not the kind of thing that shows up in an autopsy.
I wanna press charges.
Now, Dwayne, you know I can't press charges
if there hasn't been a crime.
Well, she killed him with sex.
And how much clearer does it have to be?
Dwayne, it's been a long, hard day.
Why don't you just go home and try and get some rest.
You want me to go to sleep.
Not until that murdering hussy is behind bars, where she belongs.
I'll sue her, I'll file civil suits.
She'll not get her hands on any of Dougie's money
as long as I have a breath.
Not one single red cent. Nothing.
I'll... I'll...
Harry, do you still have that bottle of Irish in your office?
I wanna put some in a little warm milk for the widow Milford.
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright.
It seems she hangs against the cheek of night
like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear.
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear.
Twin Peaks Sheriff Station, this is Lucy speaking.
One moment, please.
Sheriff Truman?
Sheriff?
Sheriff Truman.
Sheriff Truman, you have a telephone call, line three.
One moment, please.
Huh.
So wait, it gets better. And then I said:
"Well, what do you think underpants are for, anyway?"
Tell us another one. Please, another. One more.
This one time, I had this cousin.
He was a clown in this rodeo, you know.
They just had all these really big horses, you know.
And you will not believe what they made him do.
What? What?
They made him... Thank you.
They made him stand in the middle, TRUMAN: Yeah.
And take his clown costume completely off.
Can I help you?
Mr. Niles, I don't wanna put the squeeze on you.
You've been to prison,
I don't need to paint you any pictures.
What's this all about?
For starters, you're guilty of a serious parole violation.
Ugh.
Enough to put you back inside.
And unless you cooperate,
I intend to do everything in my power to make sure you stay there.
My name is Ernie Niles, and I confess.
I'm guilty.
I guess I'm terribly guilty, against my will, of course.
Mr. Niles, we're not really interested in all the...
They held me at gunpoint, they beat me,
they threatened me with physical violence.
These men are animals, they'll stop at nothing.
Mr. Niles, just...
They wanted me to sell drugs for them.
I tried to resist, but my family means everything to me.
My family... When they threatened my wife, well, I weakened, you know.
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.
I guess I did wrong but, you know,
love makes a guy do foolish things, you know, illegal things...
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie, will you shut up?
Mr. Niles, we appreciate the trials you've been through,
we sympathize with you.
You do? That's why we're here.
Oh, you are? Yes.
Now tell us everything you know.
Yes, this is, uh... Well, they tortured me,
and the thing was, they did filthy, horrible...
Mr. Niles, please.
Just the information pertaining to the selling of drugs, if you please.
All right, yeah.
Yeah. Well, they got four kilos of cocaine to sell so...
And they're looking for buyers.
So to protect my family, I told them I could find one.
Have you?
Are you kidding? I don't know anybody who would do anything like that.
You do now.
A major drug trafficker will arrive from Seattle tomorrow.
You will set up a meet with these men at the Dead Dog Farm.
I will?
How will I, uh...? How will I know him?
You're looking at him.
Him? Him...
Will you excuse me? I've got a nervous bladder.
Why?! Why?! Why would you?
You could have...
Is she gonna be okay?
First time he beat her, I swore revenge.
Something violent and noble.
She begged me not to hurt him, made me promise,
said it was for both our sakes.
That was four years ago.
One day, I swear, I'll kill him.
No matter what it costs.
Jeez, Mom, give me a heart attack.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing here sitting alone in the dark?
Nothing. Just sitting here.
Well, read a book or something, will you? It's creepy.
It's Dad, right?
He'll be back, you know he will.
This is just some of that top-secret jazz.
I'm not so sure this time.
I was at the Double R a couple of weeks ago.
Dad and I, we had this talk
about this dream he had.
It was a big house in white marble, lots of lights.
Dad was there, and I was there too,
living a life of deep harmony and joy.
And there was all this stuff about my future.
Good stuff.
Kind of nice. Mom, it was cool.
Your father is an extraordinary human being.
My father is a deeply weird individual.
But he has a lot more going on under his hat than most people,
that's for sure.
Sometimes when I'm sleeping
he runs his fingers through my hair.
He thinks I don't notice, but I do.
How long have I been gone?
Two days. Strange.
It seemed much shorter.
Garland!
Bobby, I want you to put out that cigarette.
Then I'd like you to fix me a cocktail.
A strong one, if you don't mind.
Sure, Dad.
Is everything all right?
No, dear.
Not exactly.
﻿1
Cooper.
I remember stepping from the flames, a vague shape in the dark,
then nothing.
Until I found myself standing by the cold remains of our campfire
two days later.
Major, there are some new techniques
that might help us break through your amnesia.
My memories are immune from regression.
I can feel them, they are palpable, the smells and the sensation.
Everything is known to me, yet somehow beyond my reach.
Do you remember anything else?
Very little.
Save for one disturbing image of a giant owl.
Pervasive. A giant owl?
A giant owl? How big?
Enough to cloud my mind and memory.
Three triangular scars behind the right ear in perfect proportion.
Major Briggs,
exactly what does your work involve?
That information's,
as I've repeated endlessly to myself,
classified.
Though the keeping of secrets seems less meaningful to me now.
Perhaps there are sources of information that are so important
as to transcend the human need to conspire.
Information of such weight, that pertains not...
Oh, God.
Is this meant for the soul?
My soul?
Major, perhaps you'd better start back at the beginning.
Are you familiar with Project Blue Book?
Yes, sir, I am.
The Air Force investigation into the phenomena
of unidentified flying objects.
Officially disbanded in 1969.
But there are those of us
who continue, in an unofficial capacity,
examining the heavens as before.
In the case of Twin Peaks, the earth below.
We are searching for a place called the White Lodge.
Major Briggs? I've been expecting you.
Hold on just a minute, fellows. Colonel Riley's orders.
I don't care what orders you've got,
this is my station and Major Briggs happens to be a friend of...
Harry.
I'm afraid we will have to continue this discussion at a later date.
Are you sure you wanna go with them?
Yeah.
Goodbye. Major.
Oh, go ahead, Ernie, it won't bite.
A lot you know, pal.
These men are dangerous thugs,
not that I haven't met plenty of their kind before.
Jean Renault is a hard man,
but I've known men that would make him quiver.
Ernie, come on.
Make the call.
Well, have we set the buy yet?
Trying to. Ernie's a wee bit gun-shy.
Gun-shy?
Ernie Niles is as bold as can be. Let me at him.
Please, don't make me do this.
This is suicide, I know. Please, I'm begging you, please.
For everybody's sake, please.
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie.
Hello.
May I speak to Jean Renault, please?
Hi, Jean. Yeah, I've got that big out-of-town buy here.
Hi, Lucy.
Oh.
Where have you been, Andrew?
There was a cat in a tree.
A peace officer's work is never done.
But fortunately for us, my efforts have borne more palatable fruit.
I paid the Happy Helping Hand adoption agency a visit,
where several blue-haired ladies were only too happy to sup
from my open palm.
Unfortunately, little Nicky's records have been sealed
and returned to the orphanage.
We'll never know what really happened to little Nicky's parents.
Courage, Andrew. Do not despair, dear boy.
Next stop, that selfsame orphanage.
And little Nicky's records within.
Maybe we should tell Lucy. Absolutely not.
This, dear boy, is strictly a man's job.
Follow me.
Lucy. Hi.
Any luck?
I checked the personals columns in every national newspaper on the list,
and I didn't see anything that looked like a chess deal
or find any mention of the name Windom Earle.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
More coffee?
You bet.
Is everything all right, Ed?
Couldn't be better.
This is for you.
Bye for now.
Bye-bye.
Come on, Leo.
That's a good Leo.
Each day brings a new beginning.
And every hour, the promise of...
It was your turn to feed him, Bobby!
I got practice.
Football season is over.
Baseball. Our national pastime?
Fine. You can clean when you get back.
I ain't coming back.
What?
You're looking at Ben Horne's brand-new boy.
Do the words "golden opportunity" mean anything to you?
This is my big break, Shelly.
You don't think I have anything better to do
than give Leo Johnson a bubble bath?
And what about me, Bobby?
Do I not have anything better to do?
Not that I can think of.
Bobby.
Bobby!
God!
Big Ed's Gas Farm.
Uncle Ed? James?
Yeah, it's me. Where are you? Are you all right?
Oh, I'm okay.
Uh, look, I need a favor.
Um, I need you to get all the money out of my savings account.
That's only $12, James.
Well, whatever's left.
And send it care of me to Wallies. It's this bar out on 96.
Are you in trouble?
Um, no, I really can't talk about it.
James... Listen, I really can't talk right now.
Okay. We'll talk about it soon.
Take care. Yeah.
Call soon. Okay, bye.
Long-distance? Twin Peaks.
Are you homesick, James?
No. Heh.
Tell me about Twin Peaks.
There's nothing to say.
You could start with why you left.
It was a woman, as I recall.
No, you said it was a few of them.
I loved a girl who died.
Her name was Laura.
And I thought I knew her, but I didn't.
I guess nobody did.
I'm sorry.
My life used to make sense, you know?
I didn't like it all the time, but it was mine.
And I felt like it belonged to me.
And then Laura died.
And now I belong to something else.
To Laura.
And no matter what I did,
or how much I tried to help...
...another girl got murdered.
I just wanted to get on my bike and ride away.
Take off, just go as far from Twin Peaks as the thing will take me.
I know the feeling, James.
I know the feeling.
Why do you let him hurt you?
Jeffrey's leaving.
I need you. Will you help me?
Mr. Marsh. What do you mean?
I need your help. I'll put the bags in for you.
Very good, sir.
Good morning, Mike Nelson. Oh, Lord.
You wanna share a soda?
How about a nice big piece of cherry pie? Two forks.
Mrs. Hurley, Nadine, I want my own piece of cherry pie.
In fact, I want two pieces of cherry pie, by myself.
Okay. Meat loaf.
No. Cherry pie and coffee. In fact, I want 16 cups of coffee.
I don't wanna talk with you, walk with you.
I don't wanna see you, I don't wanna know you.
Is that clear enough to understand?
Or do I need a court order to get my point across?
Mike Nelson,
you are the handsomest boy I've ever known.
And I would really like it
if you and I could go out on a date.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Hey, Norma. Where are you going?
Oh, I have to run some errands.
It's a little early for errands, isn't it?
We've still got most of the breakfast crowd.
Just you and a kitchen full of scrambled eggs.
I'll be right back.
Just think of it as a test, Hank.
I'll do that.
I thought you were moving into my place.
I'm sorry. What happened?
What the hell are you doing here?
This is my home. Home?
After everything Catherine has done to you?
I have no choice.
Josie.
Oh, go home. Josie, let me take care of you.
No. Please.
Listen, I'm safe here. And when I'm here,
you're safe too. No.
Stop.
Look at me.
I'm Catherine's maid.
I'm no good for you.
You are good for me.
I love you.
I want you.
Lucille...
What?
What's wrong?
Yes, sir, general.
I want you to lead the charge on Little Round Top.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir!
And where is General Stuart? And his cavalry?
He's a-coming, sir. Damn his eyes.
He's coming, sir. I know it! Daddy.
He's coming. He had better be. Daddy.
For all our sakes.
Because the enemy, we meet the enemy here.
We meet him before morning.
We meet him here. Daddy.
Yes, darling?
What are you doing?
There's a war going on, darling.
A war?
A war between the states.
Daddy, I think you need some help.
No, no, I'm all right, darling.
I just need a little time. This is a very important day.
Yes, Daddy, this is a very important day.
We're gonna save the business.
You and I. Darling, darling.
Yes, Daddy?
You are standing on General Stuart.
General Lee!
General Lee! Yes, sir. Old Jeb, he's come.
Oh, I don't need any more wagons!
I want my eyes and my ears beside me.
Get me General Stuart. This is Audrey.
I need you to get me Jerry Horne. Bring me General Norton.
Ready the men of the Alabama 15th. This is an emergency.
I've been figuring that we have to... I think we need to talk about what...
Come on in.
You first.
Okay.
You're the last thing I think of when I go to sleep at night.
And you're the first thought on my mind
when I get up in the morning.
I know this world is going to pieces,
and it feels like it's designed to keep us apart.
But we love each other, Ed.
I wanna be with you.
I wanna be with you no matter what happens.
Ed. Ed, Ed. Your turn.
Later.
Ouch! Will you mind the chest hair, will you?
You're sweating like a pig, Mr. Niles.
Oh, thanks a lot. Huh?
That's nervous perspiration, man. Hyperhidrosis.
It's a childhood condition.
I didn't notice it till the war. Korea, remember that year?
I was leading a battalion up towards the 49th parallel.
We were just a bunch of fresh-faced kids.
I didn't know what kind of hell we were stepping into.
Ernie. Ernie, I want you to focus on the here and now.
Repeat your instructions to me step by step.
Okay. Uh...
I take Denise up to Dead Dog Farm.
I introduce her to Renault. Right.
I, uh, take Renault through the buy,
complete the transaction and get the hell out of there.
Good. Harry? That's when you come in.
By golly, I sure wish I could join you fellas.
But I've temporarily lost my enforcement franchise.
I'll bet. Well,
I've been giving that some thought.
Consider yourself deputized.
The Bureau's loss is my gain.
I hope I can live up to this.
He's done. You might wanna towel him off before we go.
Come on.
Uh, how long will it, uh, take you guys
to storm the farmhouse after, uh, I complete the buy?
You go out, we come in.
Can I ask you a question? What, Ernie?
Don't make me do this. This isn't my line of work.
I'm a coward. I don't do this kind of thing, I'm a CPA.
Ernie. Ernie.
Heh. Just a momentary lapse. Look, I'm cool.
Let's go do it, huh?
Where's Denise? I haven't seen her.
You can call me Dennis.
Oh, I don't know, somehow it seemed more appropriate.
What do you think? Whew.
Our investigation must proceed sub rosa.
We may have to pick the lock. Tricky business.
Voilà. We enter.
Where is everybody? Lunch.
Here we are, the case files.
N, N.
N, N!
Nails, Neaster, Neatherby, Needleman.
Nicholas Needleman, our little Nicky.
We can read it in the car. Patience, Andrew.
Dick. The usual background information.
Hmm. Birthplace,
initial adoption.
Hmm. First of several, it seems.
Dick.
Ah, the plot thickens.
Where are thy secrets, little Nicky?
Dick.
Hi.
We're the Brunstons.
Heh, I know we're a little early.
It's just that we're so darn eager to see him.
Can we see him? Where is Donnie?
Uh, little Donnie is... dead.
Ah! Dead tired, I mean.
I'm afraid little Donnie, he isn't feeling up to snuff.
Well, he was in perfect health only yesterday.
Dick. Just a minute.
Woody, let me finish helping these good people.
Now, where were we?
Ed. Ed, it's Donna.
I need your help, Ed. What can I do for you, honey?
Well, I've been looking for James.
He hasn't been in school, no one's seen him at the diner.
I even went by his house, but I can't find him.
Listen, James is fine. He called.
He asked me to send him some money in care of a bar out on 96.
We didn't talk long.
It's all I know. I'll take it to him.
Well, what about your folks?
I'll explain, they'll understand.
Okay. Thanks, Ed.
I have to get going.
I'll call.
We have a lot to talk about. Yeah.
Bye. Bye.
Oh, Ed. The things we do for love.
Eddie, I'm home. Ugh!
Eddie! Look out!
You big bully!
Eddie?
Can you hear me?
Nadine? Yeah, Nadine's here.
Don't you worry about a thing, baby.
Nadine will take care of everything.
Oh.
Colonel Chamberlain and the 20th Maine
were trapped at the summit of Little Round Top.
Now, his only chance
is to maneuver his left flank
down the hillside like a swinging gate.
But we were waiting for him, Bobby.
And Chamberlain's desperate maneuver ended, Bobby, in failure.
Mr. Horne... Little Round Top, Bobby, was ours.
From that vantage point, we were able to roll back the Federal lines.
Setting the stage for Pickett's mighty charge, Bobby.
And victory!
Victory. Hurray.
General Meade,
you have suffered an ignoble defeat.
And I accept your unconditional surrender.
Okay, tell you what, Mr. Horne.
I'm gonna go and talk to President Lincoln first, okay?
So you just wait right here and...
And, uh, I'll get back to you on this whole surrender thing.
Okay? Gotta go.
Don't, uh, wanna keep the president waiting.
Sir!
Baby, I got some good news and I got some bad news.
The bad news is that your old man just bought a condo in Flip City.
The good news is that he's about to win the Civil War.
I know.
Uncle Jerry said he was coming home on the next plane.
Dr. Jacoby said he would come over tomorrow.
I think Daddy needs an injection.
God, we gotta help him.
Don't worry, baby, Bobby's on the case.
Don't call me baby.
Enter lively.
Catherine.
Hello, Ben.
You've come here to gloat, haven't you? Huh?
To, uh, celebrate my demise.
Well, you go ahead. You laugh.
You defeated me,
as I have defeated General Meade.
It's true.
I did come here to gloat.
You double-crossed me.
You tried to kill me.
And I wanted to bury you so deeply
that future generations would unearth and exhibit your remains.
Slimy rat bastard Americanus.
Do not feed.
Do not trust.
I suppose that, uh...
hat I'm not that trustworthy.
Despite everything I know about you,
I find myself here with you.
Wanting you.
You can't be serious.
I want you, Ben.
Horrifying as it seems, I can't escape it.
You, uh...
You make my body hum.
Kiss me, General Lee.
On to victory!
Hurry up, Jim. The champagne's getting warm.
Don't call me Jim.
All right, all right, all right.
James, what? You may look.
Any place you wanna go?
Jeffrey will be home by midnight.
Doesn't leave us a lot of time.
Well, I'll take what we can get.
It's a deal.
To handsome strangers.
And rebuilt engines.
You know, I never thought I'd see it drive again.
You're a miracle worker.
No, honest.
You're being too modest.
Oh, go on. You deserve it.
You're strong and you're kind.
You have a wonderfully honest face, James.
Don't laugh, it's quite rare.
Every time I look at you, I could tell exactly what you're thinking.
Well, I'd better be careful about what I'm thinking.
Don't be too careful.
Not on my account.
So, what are your plans?
I don't really have any plans.
Where will you go?
I don't know.
James, don't. What?
I don't want you to leave.
Give me some more time, James.
I can think of a hundred reasons for you to stay.
You sure you don't wanna wait for Hank?
He told me this morning he wanted in on all of this.
I think we should wait... We'll start without him.
Whatever you say.
You're sweating. Is something wrong?
Sweaty. You know, it's hyperhidrosis.
It's a childhood condition.
I was living in Guam at the time.
I contracted yellow fever.
The effects are vicious.
You know, sweating is one of the more socially unacceptable.
Sit down, Ernie. Take a deep breath.
Socially unacceptable. Everything seems to be in order.
Do you think we could hurry this up? I got a plane to catch.
Jean. Jean, take a look, his shirt is smoking.
The wire's dead.
Cooper!
Hawk.
Cooper! Coop.
He came for me, Harry.
I want safe passage to the border.
First, release the hostages.
We're at cross-purposes, Cooper.
We'll kill you if you don't.
Then everybody dies.
No, we'll trade.
Trade?
Ernie Niles and agent Bryson for me.
Coop.
I want backup. State police?
Call them in.
Lucy, it's Hawk.
Patch me through to the state police.
How's our baby boy?
Sound asleep.
Dreaming of love.
Lucky, lucky, lucky boy.
Lucky, lucky, lucky.
They moved him to the center room.
Andy, keep steady.
More deputies.
Sharpshooters.
Let's deal or let's run.
Will they let us run, Agent Cooper?
No.
So you think they will deal?
No.
What do you suggest we do?
Surrender.
Okay.
Are you crazy?
No.
But first, we must decide to give up quietly or to kill him.
Then we both die. I know.
Is my death so important to you?
My two brothers died.
I hold you responsible.
Why?
Before you came here,
Twin Peaks was a simple place.
My brothers deal dope to the teenagers and the truck drivers.
One-Eyed Jack's welcomed the businessmen and the tourists.
Quiet people lived a quiet life.
Then, a pretty girl die,
and you arrive, and everything change.
My brother Bernard,
shot and left to die in the woods.
A grieving father smother my remaining brother with a pillow.
Kidnapping. Death.
Suddenly, the quiet people, they're quiet no more.
Suddenly, the simple dream become the nightmare.
So if you die, maybe you will be the last to die.
Maybe you brought the nightmare with you.
And maybe the nightmare
will die with you.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
But I do know we've got a damn problem here.
And if you're not gonna solve it, I will.
Jean. What?
Take a look at this.
You order any food? No.
No, no, no, let her come.
Let her come.
It's just a girl.
Hello. Suppertime.
Don't I know you?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Quick thinking, Denise.
It was just my legs.
Thank Sheriff Truman. It was his idea.
Harry S. Truman.
Sometimes you gotta improvise.
He's dead.
Bobby?
Bobby?
Bobby, this isn't funny.
Bobby?
Leo?
Shelly.
Bomb. What do you mean, bomb?
Start at the beginning. Well, the voice on the phone said
that there was a bomb planted in the woods,
but it didn't say which woods.
Then all of a sudden, there was this huge explosion
and all the lights went out.
So then I called the fire department.
Good work, Lucy. Was there a fire?
Two of them. First there was one at the power station.
But most of the volunteer fire department...
I'm gonna go check on the generator. Something's not right.
Okay. So?
Were playing bingo, so it took a while to get everybody together.
Excuse me, Lucy. Then there was the explosion
I told you about, which sounded like it was right upstairs,
so we all got out of here. Well, it turned out to be a transformer
on the pole right behind and above the building.
Well, we had to wait to go back inside
because it was shooting sparks everywhere
and we were afraid that the station was gonna catch on fire too.
But it didn't.
Do they know how it started?
Suspicious in nature, that's what Chief Kipple said.
He was suffering from smoke inhalation at the time,
so he sounded a little hoarse.
You should hear his cough.
I'm gonna make him some chicken soup.
Harry? Yeah, Coop.
You'd better take a look at this, alone.
Lucy, wait here.
Good Lord.
Who is it?
I don't know.
It's a chess game.
Windom Earle's next move.
﻿1
Good Lord.
Andy,
I want this dusted for prints.
No one saw a thing.
The blackout and the fire drew everyone out of the building.
How long has he been dead? It's hard to say.
We'll need an autopsy.
Doc, if you lift up the victim's shirt, I believe you'll find a stab wound,
one inch beneath the sternum,
penetrating upwards, severing the aorta.
You've seen this before.
Yeah. Any traces?
No blood stains.
What's this?
Douglas fir, Harry? Lodgepole pine.
Hawk, footprints?
Two sets, same boots, one coming, one leaving.
Heavier impressions on the way down.
Carrying the body.
Coop, are you sure Windom Earle's behind this?
A short time ago, a vagrant,
our victim, was befriended and offered a lift.
He was driven to a location up beyond the ridge.
The car will still be there. He was stabbed once.
He managed to run a short distance before collapsing.
Windom Earle engineered the explosion
that caused the power outage.
He created a diversionary fire that drew everyone out of the station.
Brought the body in through this window.
Windom Earle has been in this room.
I can still feel his presence.
Harry, we're not gonna find any fingerprints in here.
No mistakes. No slip-ups.
Everything has its own rationale,
precision, intelligence.
Windom Earle is a genius.
And he's taken his first pawn in a very sick game.
Listen carefully, Bobby Briggs. This is what we're gonna do.
If there's one thing I learned from my father before he flipped his wig,
it's that a business relationship is like a sacred pact.
Equaled only by the closest of personal relationships,
where nothing is held back.
Right.
Do you wanna get rich, Bobby?
Immediately. Well, maybe I can help.
Let's pretend that this is my father.
An ice cube? Right.
And our job now is to help my father come back from limbo land
before he melts away and leaves us with a handful of nothing.
We wouldn't want that to happen, would we?
No.
So from now on, Bobby, I'm the one you suck up to.
What about Shelly? What about Shelly?
Leo.
Leo?
No.
No.
Help me!
Please! Help me!
No! No!
Leo? Please.
Bad girl.
Please, please don't.
No!
I swear. I'll kill you.
Help me! Help!
Shelly?
Shelly.
Shelly, come on.
No. No!
No! Shelly?
No, no, Leo.
Shelly!
Shelly! No, please.
No! Leo, you bastard!
Goodbye, wife.
Shelly.
Leo!
Goodbye.
No! Aah!
Bobby! Bobby.
Everything's okay, baby.
He's gone.
Here. Thanks, Harry.
Well, no fibers, no prints. You were right.
If it is Earle, he didn't miss a beat.
Mm. Did you hear anything from Denise?
The Bureau and the DEA cleared me of all criminal charges.
The suspension still stands.
I'm waiting to hear from Gordon.
In the meantime, you're still my deputy.
Mm-hm.
If you want this case, it's yours.
Harry, I want it.
Harry.
I found that car on the logging road just like he said.
No prints.
And just so you know, Hank Jennings didn't make the buy at Dead Dog
because he was in the hospital.
Claims he was hit by a bus.
I cuffed him to the bed and booked him for parole violations.
Oh. Shelly Johnson called.
She said Leo came to last night,
attacked her and ran off into the woods.
Holy smokes.
Lucy, we need to talk. It's about Nicky.
Little Nicky?
Dick and I have been doing some thinking and some looking,
and we think he's a... He's a...
A what?
We think he murdered his parents.
He's 9 years old. I know.
We think he was 6 at the time of the crime.
I met little Nicky. I've talked to little Nicky.
If you two think for one second
that I'll believe that a defenseless little orphan is capable of murder,
the both of you aren't fit to be fathers to a chimp.
Ow!
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this right away.
Hello, you must be James.
Um... Oh. Ha, ha.
I'm Jeffrey Marsh.
I've been hearing very good things about your work from Evelyn.
Well, you'll see how it is when you take it out.
I'm sure it will be fine. It's lucky we found you.
No, my luck.
I hear you were, uh, on the road.
Yeah, I will be soon.
Ah, no itinerary, no deadlines. I'm envious.
Wish I was going with you.
Maybe after I take her for a spin, we'll talk shop.
Sounds like we have a mutual love:
Cars.
Yeah, well, actually I'm kind of overdue as it is.
Of course he'll stay.
There are plenty of things I could find for him to do.
Uh...
Right, James?
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.
Excuse me.
Nice kid. He's done a fine job on the car.
Mm. Let's see what it will do on the open road.
Goodbye, Jeffrey.
Doc, it's Nadine I wanna talk about.
Nadine wants to start dating boys
and I don't know what to say.
Is she sexually active?
Active?
Doc, I wake up every morning feeling like I've been hit by a timber truck.
It's the extra adrenaline.
Well, it's downright dangerous.
She's liable to kill a young kid. I don't know what to say.
Be patient.
And, uh, tell her to be home by 9:00 on school nights.
Extra potatoes.
Well, thanks.
Ed, uh, Donna took the van this morning.
Said something about looking for James.
Is there anything I need to worry about?
Well, James is out west a couple of hours.
Trying to clear his head, I think. Donna's taking him some money.
Not easy being a parent, is it?
Boy, I'll say.
Well...
See you, Ed. Thanks, doc.
Hank's in the hospital.
He said a tree fell on him.
Honey, that tree was a redwood called Nadine.
Yesterday after you left, Hank jumped me.
Right in my own living room.
If Nadine hadn't shown up...
Nadine took out Hank?
Phew. And it wasn't pretty.
Harry called. He said he'll be arresting Hank for parole violation.
When Hank gets well, he may have to go back to prison.
I think it's time I start correcting a few of the mistakes I've made.
Well, we could, uh, start by getting a cabin.
A couple of venison steaks and a bottle of sparkling wine.
People will find out.
Let them.
Don't you knock? I'm sorry.
Are you leaving? Yeah.
You were good with Jeffrey.
It didn't feel that good.
I can change that.
It's wrong.
Love isn't wrong, James.
Please don't leave me.
Don't leave me alone with him.
What a shot!
I'm gonna go check my bike.
So how does chess figure into all this?
Because Windom Earle and I played a game every day for three years.
He felt that all of life
could be found in the patterns and conflicts on the board.
Because I never beat him.
Now it's my turn.
I'll publish my response in the Twin Peaks Gazette.
I don't know what else to do.
Coop, you're gonna have to give me some more information here.
Harry, I've brought some baggage to town I haven't told you about.
Windom Earle was my first partner.
Everything I know about the law and the Bureau, I owe to him.
Four years ago, we drew the assignment
of protecting a material witness in a federal crime.
She was a very beautiful, very gentle woman.
Her name was Caroline.
She and I fell in love.
One night, I failed in my vigilance.
An attack was made. I wasn't ready.
I was wounded and I lost consciousness.
When I came to, she was in my arms.
She was dead. She'd been stabbed.
The wounds on the vagrant?
Identical.
The killer was never found.
My wound healed, Windom Earle went mad.
Institutionalized until his recent escape.
So why is he after you?
Harry,
Caroline was Windom Earle's wife.
So he blames you for her death.
It's much worse than that.
I think he killed her.
And I think he committed the crime that she originally witnessed.
Harry, Windom Earle's mind is like a diamond.
It's cold and hard and brilliant.
I think he feigned the insanity that sent him away.
But at some point, he lost the ability to distinguish
between what's right and what's wrong.
You don't know what he's capable of, Harry.
You don't know.
Coffee, please.
I'm looking for a biker named James.
You look like someone in need of help.
I'm looking for someone.
What's his name?
James.
James Hurley?
Yeah.
You know him?
He did some work for me recently.
What kind of work?
He fixed my husband's car.
Where is he?
He left. Yesterday, on his bike.
Where did he go?
He said something about the ocean. Mexico, I think.
That's all?
Are you what he's running away from?
Look, dear, why don't you go home?
He'll be back.
Coffee's on me.
He's marching on Washington.
We think he's getting close.
Ben? He prefers general.
General.
Jeb.
He thinks you're General Jeb Stuart.
Oh. You're in the cavalry.
Jeb, there is a great day upon us.
By dawn, our troops will be on the outskirts of Washington.
By midday, it will fall.
And we will once again walk on our cherished fields at home.
Only God can stop us now.
And it is my firm belief, Jeb,
that the Almighty is a Southerner.
Hallelujah.
You really think it's a good idea for Ben to be carrying this sword?
Well, uh, he thinks he's on a forced march to Washington.
You know, he's crossing the Maryland border as we speak.
What he's doing is quite healthy.
I mean, by reversing the South's defeat in the Civil War,
he, in turn, will reverse his own emotional setback.
What he needs right now is both your understanding
and a Confederate victory.
Men of the South,
from this day to the ending of the earth,
we who fight shall be remembered.
For our bravery, for the battle scars that we bear.
We few...
We happy few.
We band of brothers,
onwards to Washington.
Oh, I wish I was In the land of cotton
Old time there I've not forgotten
Look away, look away Look away, Dixie land
I wish I was in Dixie Hooray, hooray
In Dixie land I'll take my stand
And live or die in Dixie
Major Briggs?
I need to see the sheriff.
Major Briggs.
More?
I'm fine. Fine, Lucy.
Fine.
Major, what happened?
Well, as men who have dedicated their lives to service,
I know that you're able to understand
how sacred I hold the Pledge of Allegiance.
And the cost one must pay when breaking a pledge.
It can be very great.
Well, the Air Force, I thought,
was not unlike other societies of men dedicated to the fight for the good.
Gentlemen, frankly, I'm worried.
When my superiors questioned me about my disappearance,
they exhibited a degree of suspicion and intolerance
bordering on the paranoid.
I must now admit that their motivation in the search for the White Lodge
is not ideologically pure.
I believe that during my disappearance, I was taken to the White Lodge.
I can remember virtually nothing.
But I have the clear intuitive sense
that there is much trouble ahead.
Major, what kind of trouble?
I am not aware of the form it will take.
I will return.
Until that time,
I will be in the shadows if you need me.
Good day, gentlemen. Good day, major.
In the shadows. Can you beat that? Nope.
Excuse me, sheriff, Agent Cooper, may I show you something?
Good.
I wanted all of you to hear this.
I've just spent almost the last 24 hours with this charming young lady.
And as you can see, uh, I have no bruises, no broken bones.
Any claims by her deceased husband's brother that she is cursed
or somehow responsible for his death is nonsense.
Now, what she does, in fact, possess is a heightened sexual drive
and a working knowledge of technique, anatomy and touch
that few men have ever had the pleasure of experiencing
or the skill to match.
Is it hot in here?
Yeah. Yeah.
Lana, let me be the first to congratulate you.
Thank you.
Well, I could never have done it without Dr. Jacoby.
Okay. Well, then, we're gonna go bowling.
See you later, guys.
Hmm.
Don't anybody move.
Mr. Mayor.
Put the gun down.
Anybody that moves, I'll blast her into kingdom come.
And the hippie too.
Dwayne.
Dwayne, this isn't gonna solve anything.
She killed my brother. Mr. Mayor, she killed no one.
Horse dung. Fellas, I've got an idea.
Why don't we let Lana and the mayor talk things over together? Alone.
I don't wanna talk. I wanna shoot.
Now, Dwayne, you can always shoot later. Talk first.
Come on, in here.
Lana, it's okay. Mr. Mayor, please.
Mr. Mayor, please.
Now what? We wait.
We wait. We wait.
It's hard waiting.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Ready, men?
Let's go.
We've decided to adopt a child.
He's so much like Dougie.
I just feel like my husband's been brought back to life.
Well, I've been lonely and selfish.
I hope you'll all forgive me for my boorish behavior.
Come along, my dear.
I don't know about you guys,
but I could definitely use something to drink.
Me too. Oh, yeah.
Hot dogs.
We forgot the hot dogs. Pete.
We forgot the wienies. All beef, with the skin on them.
Has Josie gone shopping yet? Yes, she's already gone.
Well, if you think you can tear yourself away
from all this high-level executive decision-making for a moment,
I have something I'd like to show you.
Have you ever asked yourself
how I really survived after the fire?
How I was able to marshal the resources necessary
to defeat Benjamin Horne and win back the mill?
Now that you mention it, yeah.
Come here.
Pete Martell.
Andrew?
I saw the boat.
You... Take all the time you need.
Good old Pete.
As you can surmise, I had my brother Andrew's help.
Now, let me get this straight.
You didn't die in the boat accident.
We didn't tell you, Pete...
With apologies much delayed. because you didn't need to know.
Okay. Fine.
We discovered the attempt on my life was coming,
so we arranged this little deception.
Who tried to push the button on you, Andy?
Does the name Thomas Eckhardt mean anything to you?
No.
Eckhardt and I were business partners.
I knew lumber, he knew Hong Kong.
We made a lot of money, had some fun.
Then I got the better of him in a piece of business,
and he tried to stab me in the back.
Really?
He's a very dangerous and powerful opponent.
Eckhardt planned Andrew's death for six years.
Does Josie know you're alive, Andy?
Pete, dear, Josie worked for Thomas Eckhardt.
Oh, my God.
Does she still?
We'll know when Eckhardt arrives.
He's coming here?
I've never known Josie's seductive powers to fail.
He'll come for her, like a rat for cheese.
Good evening. How may I help you?
I have two suites reserved.
Name? Eckhardt.
Thomas Eckhardt.
Welcome to Twin Peaks.
Andy, in here. We're gonna talk.
Andy?
Cooper. I need to ask you a favor.
Harry, let's get one thing straight.
I work for you now. You say drink coffee, I'll drink coffee.
This just came over the wire from Seattle.
Josie told me she got away from him.
Think Josie had something to do with this?
I don't know. I don't know.
That's why I need you to find out.
Okay, Harry.
When Lucy told me about your theory,
I called the orphanage and cut through the red tape.
Nicky is no more a murderer than Lucy or I.
I believe "pathological" was the phrase...
Dick, I did not drop you on your head when I brought you into this world.
Don't give me cause to regret that.
Doc, it's just that... Shut up, the both of you, and listen.
Nicky entered this world through the back door,
where hope and promise never see the light.
His mother was a poor immigrant chambermaid at the Great Northern.
Nicky was conceived during an assault in a back alley
by a man who fled across the border.
She never reported it to the police
but when she began to show, she reported it to me.
But Nicky's mother had a dream of a better life for herself and her child.
A dream that she brought with her to this country.
She decided to carry that child.
But the poor wretch never saw the boy.
She died just as Nicky took his first breath.
We buried her in potter's field and sent the infant to the orphanage.
For several years, Nicky was shuttled from one state home to another.
And then one day, hope shined on little Nicky.
A young, childless couple took him into their lives.
They were loving, caring parents.
But it all collapsed one terrible moment on an icy highway.
There was a crash.
Six-year-old Nicky managed to pull his parents from the blazing car,
but it was too late.
And Nicky was alone again,
as he is today.
I hope you two are happy.
James, what are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing?
Are you leaving? Are you leaving?
I can't stay here.
I don't understand. It's wrong!
Because I'm married? Yes.
Yes.
I love you, James.
I've never said that to anybody before in my life.
I love you.
There's been an accident.
Jeffrey is dead.
His car? Yes.
You killed him.
No. No. No.
My God! You set me up!
It was Malcolm's idea. He's not my brother.
Hurry, James.
Go find that young girl who loves you.
Go.
James?
Donna?
Donna.
We gotta hurry.
Come on. Come on.
Where is Shelly? Bad girl.
No, no. Come in.
It's all right. I'm a friend.
Come in.
You look like you've had a very hard night.
Come. Sit.
I will help you.
What's your name?
Leo. Leo?
Well, Leo.
You can call me Windom.
Windom Earle.
﻿1
Would you know his full name?
I barely knew the kid.
Jim. Uh...
Jim. James.
James Hurley.
He said he was from Twin Peaks.
He's a drifter.
He was probably long gone by the time Mr. Marsh pulled out of the driveway.
Did he work here long?
Mrs. Marsh hired him to fix the Jaguar.
Jaguar...
J-A-G-W... A car.
How did you meet him, Mrs. Marsh?
Jeffrey's Jaguar broke down near Wallies.
I went in to use the phone.
He offered to help.
Okay, we'll check that. Thank you.
And so we bid adieu to James Hurley.
Give it a rest.
Careful, Evelyn.
I'm not sure I can tolerate a nervous co-conspirator.
I just want it over with, all right?
Anything you say, Mrs. Marsh.
James, we can't get out of this by ourselves.
We're gonna need someone to help us.
I didn't do anything.
Malcolm killed Mr. Marsh. I'm being framed.
Can I get you something, Miss Hayward?
No. No, thank you.
Look, it doesn't make any difference.
We can't wait for the cops to catch us.
I think I should call Ed. No, no, don't.
I gotta... My only chance is to talk to Evelyn myself.
If she told me that this was all a setup, maybe she'll just tell the police that too.
You're sure?
Yeah.
You wouldn't have a chance. The cops will be waiting for you.
We've gotta keep moving.
She'd listen to me though. I know she would.
Would she?
Why?
I'm gonna go call Ed.
Stay here.
Hi, Ed? Hi, it's Donna.
Listen, I don't have a lot of time, but I think James is in trouble.
Well, he's been working for this woman.
Uh, working on her car, um,
and I think there's been this accident and...
Hi, how are you doing, Yvette?
Listen, I heard about your new boyfriend.
Yeah, that's great, really.
Good to hear it.
So tell me about him.
Excuse me. Hi, Frank.
What were you doing at Shelly's house last night, Bobby?
Shelly almost gets murdered and you're worried about what I'm doing?
What about Leostein?
What were you doing at Shelly's house?
Look, here's the deal.
Shelly and I are together, okay?
We have been for a long time, since before Laura died,
before and after Leo went into his drool mode.
Bobby?
Where were you the night the mill burned?
What's that got to do with this?
Leo tried to kill you.
Maybe you shot him. No way.
I went to Shelly's the night the mill burned down,
because I was worried about her.
He was about to bury an ax in my head
when Hank Jennings shot him through the window.
You sure it was Hank? Absolutely.
What's Hank's connection with Leo?
I don't know, man. Why don't you tell me?
Shelly, do you have any idea where Leo might be now?
No, I don't.
I'll assign a couple of my deputies to the house 24 hours a day.
Hey, man, I can take care of Shelly all right.
You can just save the deputies.
Bobby Briggs,
button it.
You can go now. Okay.
Shelly, don't worry, we're not gonna let you out of our sight.
Thank you. Come on, Shelly.
I feel so much safer, don't you, Shelly?
Bobby.
Get a life, punk.
Gentlemen.
Another trip on the "Seattle to Twin Peaks" shuttle.
How are you?
Looking good, Harry. Yeah.
Albert. Coop.
Gentlemen. What have you got?
My invite back to Twin Peaks.
Windom Earle. Direct orders from Gordon Cole.
As he so succinctly put it:
"I'm worried about Coop."
Springfield, Kansas City, Lawton, Dallas, Jackson.
Earle's been sending gift-wrapped packages
to police departments and major law enforcement agencies.
Each looks like a mail bomb, but they turn out to be harmless.
The deliveries were paid for by a phony credit card signed Windom Earle.
What's in the boxes?
One article of clothing in each.
One, a white veil, two, a garter, three, a pair of white slippers,
four, a pearl necklace, and finally, a wedding dress.
Caroline's.
He's got DEA and FBI, not to mention Mississippi, Oklahoma
and Illinois State patrols looking for him.
Everyone's invited to the party.
But my guess is, he won't dance with anyone but you, Coop.
The vagrant from the office died from a knife wound severing the aorta.
This guy's finger is pointed directly at this chess piece.
How did Earle manage that with the rigor mortis?
Well, rigor mortis goes from head to toe.
But after two days, it leaves the body from toe to head.
So he waited for it to leave the arms and the fingers
so they could be maneuvered onto the chess board.
And then he played Zeus at the power station.
What was found? This map.
Taped to the bottom of a table.
Good work, Albert.
He's making his move. Most definitely.
Yeah.
Oh, Coop, uh, about the uniform.
Yes, Albert?
Replacing the quiet elegance of the dark suit and tie
with the casual indifference of these muted earth tones
is a form of fashion suicide, but, uh, call me crazy.
On you, it works. Heh.
Thank you, Albert.
Ah, you're awake then.
Heh. I trust you've slept well?
While you've slept, I've learned all about you.
Leo Johnson.
The police would like to see you as soon as possible.
Now, let me see.
Ah! Drug trafficking.
Arson. Ooh, ha, ha.
Attempted murder.
Domestic violence. Now I am partial to that.
Well, Leo, I've cleansed your wounds.
You're on the mend.
I've removed the proverbial thorn from your paw.
Leo. Leo the lion.
Now...
I want you to help me.
And obey me.
Will you do that? Hmm?
Did you know that, in the 13th century in Japan,
the samurai were stripped of their weaponry.
But they discovered that the aged and treated bamboo
of their shakuhachi flute made an excellent cudgel.
This flute is truly an instrument of pleasure.
Don't you think?
Meow.
I wanted to save this necklace for an occasion,
but you've ruined it.
Ha, ha. Meow.
Now...
Come over here.
Mm. I've made you some gruel.
Come on, Leo, eat your gruel.
Yum, yum. Mm, heh.
It's been 20 years, babe.
One day we're talking about a graduation party
and the next day we're here.
And in between nothing but a world of hurt.
I tried not to think about it.
I just spent more and more time at the diner,
trying to make the place work.
Because I had nothing else.
We were open every day,
so I wouldn't have to have another life.
No birthdays,
no Fourth of July,
no Christmas.
Well, I turned all my Christmases into a week full of Mondays.
When that didn't work,
I thought about all the presents I never bought you.
Never got to give you.
I bought you a present last Christmas.
It was a turquoise and onyx bolo tie.
I walked over to your house to give it to you,
but I couldn't go in.
I just waited.
I could see you through the window.
I don't know why I couldn't go in.
I'm sorry I didn't.
All that time,
you should have been in my home.
In my bed.
It's about the future now, Ed.
And what we're gonna do about it.
I want you to come tonight after I close the diner.
Take me home.
You're right.
It's all ahead of us.
Plenty of time.
Eddie?
Eddie? No, no, no.
I may as well talk to her now.
Hello, Nadine.
I got all the way to the district finals at Knife River,
only to find out the airplane slam is illegal.
I was disqualified.
Second place, what a drag.
Oh, boy, what a tough break, huh?
Hello, Nadine.
I owe you an apology, Norma.
I mean, I really pounded Hank and I am sorry.
But I thought he was gonna do something to Eddie.
And I sort of got mad.
Thank you.
Eh.
Know what?
I know about you guys.
It's really, really okay.
Because I don't have to feel so guilty about me and Mike.
You and Mike?
I don't wanna get into it, but I have to tell you,
it is really, really serious.
So you guys can go ahead and do whatever you want.
I am completely cool about all of this.
Really.
Josie...
This is it.
The Seattle police want answers and I have to tell them something.
They know you were connected with Jonathan.
How did he die?
He was shot three times in the back of the head.
Josie...
If you were ever gonna tell the truth,
now would be an ideal time.
Think I'll get another cup of joe.
Ah.
Is that you, Pete?
Yeah. Cooper? Yeah.
I get over to the Clean and Save
and Jeanie Pombelek is working the counter.
She does not speak one word of English.
Nada, zip.
She's from Budapest.
We just stood there and looked at each other
like we were made of wood.
Who does all this belong to, Pete? Oh...
Catherine's been running her into the ground.
Need a hand? So I offered to stop
by the dry cleaners and pick up Josie's stuff.
You know, the only words I know in Hungarian are paprika and goulash.
It took me 20 minutes to get this stuff.
Let me get that. Give me a hand.
Hello.
Just hold a minute.
It's for Josie. Is she here? She's in the other room, Pete.
Hello. Josie.
It's Thomas.
I'm so glad I've found you.
I was wondering if we could get together.
Did you hear about what happened to Jonathan?
Dreadful.
Welcome to Twin Peaks, Mr. Eckhardt.
She's run back to Catherine Martell.
I'm so disappointed.
So I asked Stonewall Jackson what he would like to do
after we run the Yankees up to Canada.
He said: "Follow them. I wanna be the Duke of Montréal."
Oh, that Stonewall.
I once asked him
what he thought I should do with Lincoln.
And he says, "Old Honest Abe is about as useful to you
as a spittoon cleaner in a whorehouse."
Whoa! Whoa, traveler. Whoa!
What do you think, Dr. Jacoby?
Ah, letting him out to mingle with the public doesn't seem to have helped.
Well, you have to admit, he's kind of fun this way.
What's the matter with you? That's my father, your brother.
We can't leave him like this.
Well, now, Audrey, honey, now.
There are some advantages to leaving him, click, click, insane.
Told me that every man, woman and child...
Now, Audrey, you know I was upset too,
but there's some projects, both domestic and international,
that I'd might get a chance to develop.
I mean, one man's crisis is another man's opportunity.
Let me tell you something, Uncle Jerry.
We leave him the way he is, and I become executor of the estate.
Audrey, it's a little more complicated than that, sweetheart.
No, it isn't. I've examined his will, Jerry.
If my father becomes incapacitated, it all goes to me when I'm old enough.
And I am old enough, Jer, and he is incapacitated.
I have my way either way.
When the only project you'll be developing
is selling baseboard heaters at the local Cash 'n' Carry.
What's happened to the man is a tragedy.
It is a tragedy, Jer.
Dr. Jacoby, I want you to bring my father back.
To the office? Parade, rest!
To the real world.
I think it's time we implement the Appomattox scenario.
Hey, sorry I'm late. A couple of bikers tried to take this jacket.
But old Stonewall's gone from me now,
cut down in a hail of Yankee lead.
He died alone,
without my comfort.
Laddy.
Come here.
You know what I wanna hear. Troops, about face.
"Dixie." "Dixie"!
Forward, march.
Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there were not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land
Oh, I wish...
Mrs. Marsh?
I'm Donna, James' friend.
I remember you.
Get the lady here a drink.
With a little umbrella in it.
Go on, dear, sit down, it's all right.
Why are you doing this to James? Why not?
Because he's a good person.
He was good at two things:
The car and me.
You don't get it, do you? I'm talking about our lives.
Life. Life will be rosy if you can just get out of one silly little jam.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Talk to me in a couple of years
when your whole life has turned to crap.
You really like to make everything sound pointless and stupid.
If there was a reason to climb out of this primeval swill,
believe me, dear, I'd know it.
Would you, really?
Oh, here we are. The car's waiting, Mrs. Marsh.
Get in it.
I'm sorry about your friend, honey. There's nothing you can do.
So why don't you trundle along to your little town,
safe in the knowledge that, if I ever see you here again,
I'll kill you.
Don't do this to him, please!
Please.
Coop, take a look at this.
Vicuña thread sample taken from Josie's coat.
Traces found on the floor outside your room.
They're from the same coat?
Let me put it to you this way, either Josie Packard pulled the trigger,
or she's loaning her winter wear to the wrong people.
It's a perfect match. What about the gloves?
Checking for powder burns. I'll have the results in the morning.
From the Seattle Homicide?
Locals are looking for a beautiful Asian woman,
late 20s, in connection with the murder of one Jonathan Kumagai.
He has an Interpol sheet as long as your arm
and three holes in the back of his head.
I'm betting the bullets will match the slugs we took from your vest.
I hope it's not Josie, for Harry's sake.
Coop, as you know, Truman and I have had our differences in the past.
But the big lug's got his heart in the right place, if nothing else.
And I'm not above feeling a little sympathy for the stalwart and the dull.
What's you point, Albert? Speaking frankly?
Feel free.
Our sheriff's got a serious problem with his girlfriend.
Albert,
not one word until we're certain.
Ah.
Coop.
Our John Doe's got a name:
Erik Powell. Transient. Former merchant marine by his prints.
Powell?
Yeah, ring a bell?
Powell was Caroline's maiden name.
Do you think this Powell is a relative?
No. Earle's playing the game according to his own rules.
Every move he makes sends a message.
The fact that he chose the name Powell
tells me he hasn't forgotten a thing that went on between us.
So whenever he takes a piece from the board...
Someone dies.
I never beat him, Harry.
Coop, if you've got a need for a chess expert,
we've got one of the best right here in town.
Checkmate.
Checkmate.
And mate.
Frankly, I am impressed.
I owe it all to the great José Raúl Capablanca.
Now, if there's chess boards in heaven,
José's sitting next to the Lord.
Doc? The mind reels.
One of these days. Ha, ha.
Pete, I need your help.
I'm playing a chess match of considerable importance.
I can't say any more than that.
Suffice to say, I'd like to stalemate the game,
losing as few pieces as possible. None, if that can be arranged.
Well, Agent Cooper, I'd be proud to serve.
Thanks, Pete.
Great players are either far or few.
Hi. Shelly.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Are you okay?
Not really.
I wanted to come right over,
but with Hank gone, it's been a madhouse here.
You, um, don't need any help, do you?
Um, I... I'd...
I'd feel safer, Norma.
Are you kidding?
It hasn't been the same without you.
When can you start?
Um, now? Great. Welcome back.
Thank you.
Norma?
Hi, Shelly. Hi.
Excuse me. Uh, I need to talk to you for a minute.
There's something you should know.
Hank's nearly ready to leave the hospital.
What about his parole violations?
Harry, this time I don't want him back.
Don't worry. He won't be back. Hank's going to jail.
We're charging him with the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.
Add that to breaking parole,
Hank's going away for a long time.
Good.
Mr. Eckhardt, welcome.
Josie, help our guest with his coat.
I must confess I received your invitation with some surprise.
Well, word travels fast in Twin Peaks.
I thought it was fitting that I dined with my late brother's business rival.
Some wine, Josie.
Your brother was not always my rival. We were friends.
But your friendship soured. Sadly.
Men of business frequently find their personal lives disrupted
by the larger portraits they paint.
You consider yourself an artist? The wine, Josie.
Of a sort. Your brother was as well.
I wonder, Mr. Eckhardt.
When you had him killed, was it for art or money?
Don't stand there, Josie, pour. Call me Thomas. Your brother did.
Thomas. We'll have our hors d'oeuvres now, Josie.
One does not kill for art or money.
They are commodities easily lost and just as easily gained.
However, one, rather I, might find reason to kill for love.
Did you love her that much? Yes.
Josie has the most incredible hands.
Every finger a thing of beauty.
I remember.
I wonder, what shall we do about her?
It would be a shame if you left empty-handed.
Of course, I'll miss her cheery disposition.
We've become the best of friends.
Two girls chatting over tea.
Perhaps you should purchase an animal of some kind.
A cat or a dog.
If I give her to you, what will you give me in return?
How can I place a value on something so precious?
But you will try?
Yes.
Josie.
Thomas and I will have our main course now.
Why did you do it?
You know I've been going through it.
I can't figure it out. James, you're not safe here.
If Malcolm finds you... Is it the money?
Is that it? No. No, I got it.
It was Malcolm. Oh, yeah. He made you do it. Right?
You better tell me a story, Evelyn. Because I'm all mixed up.
I just wanna know why you would do this to me.
James.
What did you expect? An apology? A hidden heart of gold?
I did it all, James. I did everything.
I found you, I lured you in and I kept you here,
while Malcolm planned a nice, neat little frame.
Why? For the money.
Out of fear.
Because I wanted to do it.
It's not exactly what you wanted to hear, is it, James?
The truth hurts, doesn't it?
James, you're good and you're honest.
I'm not.
But that doesn't mean there weren't moments
when I truly wanted you here.
Not for Malcolm,
or for the money, but for me.
For the good and honest way that you taste.
I like how you taste too.
Malcolm, what did you do? James, James. You hurt him.
He broke into the house,
he was angry, he was crazy.
He killed Jeffrey and he came back to kill you.
You poor, defenseless little widow.
But you were ready for him, Evelyn.
You got your gun,
and you shot James.
You shot him until he was dead.
General Lee. Whoa.
Welcome to our humble horse... Home, General Lee.
Thank you. And you are? Scarlett McLean.
And this is my father...
This is my father. Oh.
Wilmer McLean at your service.
I'm indeed honored to be making your extremely sociable acquaintance.
And why are you armed with my sword, sir?
I like your sword, sire.
Thank you, Daddy. Thank you. Where is General Grant?
General Grant's a-coming, sire, I know it.
Excuse us.
General Grant.
General Lee.
Sir, we met during the Mexican War. Do you remember?
I have come to surrender the North.
The Mexican War, sir. Do you remember?
JACOBY; Oh, yes, yes. It was a good war, as I remember.
Nonsense. All wars are nothing but madness.
Disguised as the patriotic ventures of politicians,
too old and too cowardly to participate in them.
No, no, sir, I have no love for war. Me neither.
And even less for politicians. Hey, amen.
But, as for the men who fight them,
they have my eternal respect and sympathy.
All right, general, enough of this fruitless conversation.
My terms:
Federal officers may keep their sidearms
and other general possessions.
Officers and men claiming to own their own horses may keep them too.
And, uh, officers and men will be allowed to return to their home,
not to be disturbed by the Confederate States' authorities.
I surrender. Of course you do.
The articles.
Here, sire, the articles. Sir.
The articles, sir.
You will sign, General Grant. Oh, yes, yes, yes.
And may I add that, that you've been a valiant opponent of fine character.
I thought the North won the Civil War?
Ben?
Ben.
Daddy.
Ben? Ben? Daddy?
Hey, give him some room.
Where am I?
Where am I? Twin Peaks, Ben.
Oh. I had the strangest dream.
Heh.
And you were there.
And you, and you.
It was incredible.
It was a war.
And I was General...
General Robert E. Lee.
And somehow, in spite of incredible odds,
I won.
Now you're home, Daddy.
Yes.
I'm home. Attaboy, Ben. Ha, ha.
How do you feel? Any, any aftereffects? Dizziness?
I feel terrific.
I feel, uh... Yes?
What is it, Daddy? What are you doing in those clothes?
Attaboy, Ben.
What? What's the joke?
Attaboy, Ben.
Work slowly.
And with care.
Everything must be written with a steady, uncompromising hand.
No, no, no.
Terrible.
Erase.
Now...
Try again.
Concentrate.
Leo, for heaven's sake.
Here. Shh, shh, shh.
Let me show you.
Like this:
There you go.
Much better.
I am proud of you, Leo.
Windom Earle? Yes.
Windom.
Heh.
Pretty words for pretty girls.
Which one shall be my queen?
Queen?
No. No.
No.
Lick.
The story rings a little truer with your fingerprints on...
No, Malcolm, I can't.
Just your prints. Leave the rest to me.
I'll do my best to imitate the actions of a hysteric.
Five shots, tightly grouped,
as though the gun went off in your hand.
Repeatedly. No!
No! No! James, James, James.
Don't hurt him any more, please. Give me the gun.
I've called the cops. They're on their way, it won't work.
Malcolm. She's lying. Give me the gun.
Evelyn, please don't let him die, please.
Please. Evelyn.
Give me the gun, Evelyn.
Evelyn, give me the gun. No.
Evelyn, give me the gun. No.
Evelyn. Evelyn.
I can't do this, Malcolm.
Then I will.
No.
He was angry,
he was crazy.
He killed Jeffrey, came back to kill me.
I was ready, though.
I got my gun and I shot him.
I shot him till he was dead.
Caroline.
For Miss Audrey Horne, please.
Owls?
Breathtaking, wasn't she?
A truly beautiful woman, Caroline.
Funny, isn't it?
After all this time,
after all that happened in Pittsburgh,
I still love her.
And I know that you do too.
Now, Dale, listen carefully.
It's your move.
﻿1
Now, Dale, listen carefully.
It's your move.
Please put your heart into it, will you?
I've noticed a certain tentative quality in your thinking,
as if your mind were occupied with issues
other than those on the board before you.
Such preoccupation not only weakens one's resolve,
but one's foresight as well.
A deadly failing in any match, you must agree,
but in this particular contest, quite disastrous,
as we play for grave stakes,
the likes of which you have no doubt surmised.
Print your move in tomorrow's paper.
Or I will make it for you.
That tears it. Cooper, I'm not letting you out of my sight.
Harry, if Windom wanted to kill me, I'd already be dead.
Yeah.
Better get Pete on the horn. Right.
Lucy, call Pete Martell, get him over here right away.
Then call the paper.
Find out the latest possible deadline for tomorrow's personals column.
Paper and Pete, got it.
I'll do it alphabetically.
She was beautiful.
She was the love of my life, Harry.
Okay, Lucy.
Okay, yeah, just tell Harry I'll be right there, okay?
Right.
Aah! Ha, ha. Ha-ha-ha.
Ah? Ah?
Peter.
Salt and pepper.
Coming right up, poodle.
You two bring out the worst in each other.
Oh, Pete's a prince of a man. A court jester.
Well, I've got to mosey.
Goodbye, you sweet Packards.
Oh, Catherine.
Catherine, I'd always have hoped that time and age would mellow
that tempest raging inside you.
Watching you two act like the Hardy Boys
always brings on stormy weather.
What's happening with Ghostwood?
I talked to the investors, the meeting is set.
I leave for Paris tomorrow.
Oh, company.
Dear Josie... Huh!
I'm home, did you miss me?
Oh, she looked surprised.
Poor Josie.
Oh, she has her charms, though.
Yes, but not for long.
Come in.
Hi, Harry. Save it, Hank.
What happened? Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning?
So I broke parole. Cry me a river.
You crossed the border into Canada.
You consorted with the drug dealers at Dead Dog Farm.
You tried to kill somebody.
I'm charging you with the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.
Ouch.
Well, I think it's safe to assume that I was at the diner
the night that Leo was plugged.
But you're welcome to call... I got a witness.
Puts you at the scene with a gun in your hand.
Harry, you obviously seem serious about this,
so I'm going to propose a trade.
How about information leading to the arrest
and conviction of Andrew Packard's murderer?
Hank Jennings, witness for the prosecution.
No deals.
You're telling me you're more interested
in the attempted murder of Leo Johnson, felon,
than Andrew Packard?
How's that gonna sit with your constituents?
You're through, Hank.
My guess is, Harry, not too well.
Especially once they find out who pushed the button on Andrew
and that you're sleeping with her.
Gee, I'm sorry.
Get him out of here.
Get him out of here!
Give me that.
This is the bullet we removed from you.
This is the one that was excavated from the dead man's skull.
Same bullets, same gun, same killer. Let's go get her.
Albert, hold your horses. Coop,
I appreciate any reluctance you have for busting your pal's old lady,
but the woman ventilated you and left you for dead.
Albert, I don't take it personally.
What about the gloves, the powder tests?
News at 5. All right, fine, you're not mad,
but there's an epidemic of multiple gunshot wounds
following this chick around. She is a menace.
I'll talk to her.
Maybe she'll confess, turn herself in.
Maybe she'll grow wings and join the circus.
Randy, I've got a list of all our non-repeat guests.
We're gonna send them a special invitation to the Great Northern.
Your enthusiasm brings a salty tear to the eye.
However,
I think you will find my job requires a little more
than a tight sweater and a perky attitude.
Randy, I'm learning the business.
Every week a different department. I don't want your job.
Yes, I look forward to your stint in housekeeping.
This came for you this morning.
Good luck, Miss Horne. You'll need it.
Hi.
I just checked into Room 215. Congratulations.
Strange, they told me at the front desk I should talk to you.
What is it I can do for you?
Sorry, thought you were working.
I am working.
I'm working, see?
I see.
Audrey.
Horne? At your service.
Could you send someone out to the airport?
I'm traveling with some heavy equipment this trip.
Didn't have enough room in the van.
What flight were you on? My own.
On the jet out there. Shouldn't be hard to find.
Is there anything else I can do for you, Mr. Rockefeller?
No, thank you.
Yeah.
I have a picture of you.
You're wearing a little dirndl skirt, got a white apron on, you have pigtails.
It's unbelievably cute.
I don't wear dirndl.
You did then.
It was right here. The Great Northern dining room.
If I close my eyes, I can almost see it.
Little Audrey Horne as Heidi.
Well, anyway, it's unforgettable.
Heidi.
I was 10. Hey!
Thank you.
"Save the one you love.
Please attend gathering of angels tonight at the Road House, 9:30."
Nadine?
Honey, what are you doing home from school?
Are you feeling poorly?
Don't.
Don't what?
Oh, Eddie. We have to talk.
Okay.
Mike and I are in love.
In love? I hope you're not hurt.
I wouldn't wanna hurt you for anything in the world.
Honest, you have to believe that.
But Mike and I, on that wrestling trip,
we had the most magical night together.
All night?
Well, you and Norma did it.
Well, that's fair.
So, what's this mean?
Eddie.
We have to call a spade a spade.
We're breaking up.
Eddie,
I'm so sorry.
Josie, I want you to level with me about what happened in Seattle.
I told you.
How many times do I have to say it?
I escaped from Jonathan in the airport
and I don't know what happened to him after that.
Do you understand I could arrest you right now?
I came here as a friend of Harry's.
Now, I don't know what place he occupies in your heart,
but I do know that you own his.
I would think you'd like a chance to explain yourself to him.
Please go.
This is the end of it, Josie. There are no other options.
I want you at the station house by 9:00.
Or I come and find you.
Oh, Josie, I just saw Agent Cooper leave.
Was this a social call?
Dear, you look awful.
Is everything all right?
I don't feel very well. Oh, I'm sorry.
I wish I had better news.
I've spoken to Mr. Eckhardt again on your behalf.
While he's not entirely unsympathetic,
he does insist on seeing you alone.
Tonight.
He'll kill me.
To tell you the truth,
my biggest worry is what he's going to do
when he finds out that Andrew is alive.
Won't Mr. Eckhardt think that you've betrayed him?
But of course, you can tell him that you didn't.
After all, you did actually think that Andrew was dead.
Oh, no.
I don't know. I don't know.
Heh. Maybe you can help me. I think I'm going mad.
You will simply have to face Mr. Eckhardt
sooner or later.
Tell him the truth.
Tell him whatever you want.
Just pray that he believes you.
Oh, there they are.
No answer. He must be on his way.
Thanks, Bobby.
Look, why don't you join us?
Yeah? Yeah.
You know, board meetings are usually nothing more than a gathering
of self-minded individuals,
each more intent than the other on financial gain.
No, thank you.
But today...
Today is going to be something completely different.
Am I late? Hot dog, Ben, look at you. How are you?
You are a sight for sore eyes. Look who's talking.
We taking good care of you? The best.
My luggage arrived. Thank you, Audrey.
You two have met? Briefly.
John Justice Wheeler.
Used to be in construction.
Came up the hard way. How nice.
You remember my brother Jerry?
That is Jerry. Oh, my God. Hi, Jack.
And this is, uh, my executive assistant, Bob Briggs.
Bob. Hey, what's up?
Pleasure. Why don't you all just take a seat?
I've, uh, asked Mr. Wheeler to join us on the board.
Years ago, I made an investment in him,
a pittance,
which he built into an empire.
Now, I don't take any credit,
but I believed in Jack
even when he was a local boy pounding nails.
I've asked him to return the favor and believe in me now.
Ben, you're testing my well-worn modesty.
All right, suffice to say,
Horne Industries Incorporated have fallen on hard times.
The mill,
the Ghostwood lands, are now solely owned by Catherine Martell.
We don't begrudge her, the mill was and is, after all, hers.
So,
in spite of these reversals
and, uh, stripped of all the trappings of success,
what are we left with?
The human spirit.
What is the greatest gift
that one human being can give to another?
The future.
I give you...
...the little pine weasel.
Found only in our tri-county area,
it is nearly extinct.
They're incredible roasted. Ahem.
According to an environmental impact report,
what few pine weasels remain will be all but wiped out
with the Packard plans for Ghostwood development.
So you wanna save the weasel?
No, Bobby.
Not just the weasel.
But life as we know it.
I want Twin Peaks
to remain unspoiled
in an era of vast environmental carnage.
So we block Catherine's development until the wheel turns
and we get another shot.
That's brilliant, Ben. That's brilliant.
I plan to fight
this Ghostwood development on every ground
and with every available weapon.
The little pine weasel...
...is about to become a household word.
Then what?
Then I am considering
a run for the Senate.
Thank you.
Annie, it's no problem. I've got plenty of room.
You just get on the next bus, okay? And I'll be waiting.
Oh, honey, don't cry.
It's gonna be all right.
I'll see you soon.
I love you too.
Bye.
So your sister coming? Tomorrow.
God, what do you have to do to get out of a convent?
You just leave, it's not a prison.
Sounds like prison to me. No TV, no boyfriends.
You know, when she was little, I always used to think
that Annie was from another place and time.
I guess the convent has been good for her in a way.
Hard to imagine her out in the world.
Oh, look, here's something for you.
Who from? I guess who was ever sitting there.
Look at this.
"Mountains kiss, waves clasp.
Flower, sunlight, the moonbeams, is all this, thou kiss."
None of this makes sense.
"Save the one you love.
Please attend a gathering of the angels tonight at the Road House, 9:30."
Sounds intriguing in a way,
but it sounds dangerous.
I wonder who this is from.
Norma Jennings, I've loved you every day for the past 20 years
and I dream about you every night.
It's time for us to be together.
Will you marry me?
Ed? We deserve to be happy.
It's our turn, baby.
All night long I held her in my arms
Just to keep her From the foggy, foggy dew
Good job, fella.
Good boy.
Just a few more, and then we'll eat.
Fly to my breast, Pierce me in colors autumnal,
speak to me only of love.
Leo, you have an incomplete education.
For instance, survival in the wilderness?
A relevant issue in your life, my friend.
Now, this comes under the heading of practical instruction.
I hope you've been paying attention.
Ow.
Whoo.
Nature is cruel.
This is also a lesson.
Hi, honey.
How are you feeling?
Oh, great, now that you're here.
Hank, I came here to ask you for a divorce.
Well, first let me say, I don't blame you.
You gave me a second chance and I blew it.
I don't know why I'm so self-destructive,
but I can see
that that's my priority in getting well.
I got a lot of work to do.
In fact, I decided
I'm gonna try to go into therapy.
I don't wanna be like this anymore.
That's very interesting, Hank.
But I have to get on with my life.
I know.
I know you do.
I just want you to be happy.
Thank you.
I want you to do me one last favor.
I want you to help me get out of here.
If they send me back to prison, I'll die.
Tell the sheriff that I was at the restaurant
the night that Leo Johnson was shot.
I was on my way home. I can't prove it, but you can.
No more lies, Hank.
It's not lying, it's trying to save my life.
No.
You're killing me here, Norma.
Don't blame this on me. Don't you dare.
Is it Ed?
Is that who you're running to?
Okay.
Then here's the deal.
You give me my alibi and I give you your divorce.
I didn't come here to negotiate with you.
This is it, it's over.
Fine.
Go ahead.
You're his whore, Norma.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Norma!
Now, there are four or five different ways of doing this thing,
and they all have their virtues.
I remember Capablanca and Lasker,
St. Petersburg, 1914...
Pete. Yeah.
We've only got five minutes.
All right.
Lucy. Sheriff?
Get the Gazette on the phone.
Tell them not to close out the personals. We need more time.
The Gazette. Okay.
That's it.
Guaranteed to cause some sleepless nights.
As long as he can't remove another piece from the board.
He can't do it. Not at least for five, six more moves.
Maybe he'll kill anyway.
Maybe it'll just frustrate him. I don't think so, Harry.
Earle has a perverse sense of honor about these things.
I never heard of a man who murdered by the rules.
Coop?
Albert.
Good work, Pete.
Here it is, straight up.
I got a match on the gun that whacked you with the powder residue
on Josie Packard's gloves.
Seattle police have also come up with an eyewitness
who positively ID'd Josie leaving the car where they found the stiff.
If you ain't gonna bust this bitch,
I would consider it a personal... Albert, I can handle it.
I think you just did.
Come in.
I assume you still have a taste for bubbly.
We've killed enough bottles in our time.
To beginnings.
And endings, and the wisdom to know the difference.
I am sorry, Andrew.
I hated you at first, of course.
Perfectly normal response.
As my anger diminished,
I recalled that Eckhardt has a way of persuading people to do anything.
It was his idea, of course. Yes.
He made me do it.
And he said you never loved me.
You just married me to get back at him.
That's not true, I did love you very much.
Of course, the same cannot be said for you.
Please, Josie,
let there be no more lies between us.
You had a job to do and you did it. Now you're paying the price.
Every action has its consequence, my dear.
The police are closing in. If you don't take action,
you'll be sleeping in a jail cell tonight.
What can I do? Please help me.
You must see Eckhardt.
Perhaps you were meant to be together all along.
I'm sure he truly loves you.
He doesn't know I'm alive. He can get you out of this country.
Go to him, Josie.
Now.
Andrew.
We won't speak again.
Hi.
It's beautiful.
I wanted us to go someplace we've never been before.
Come on.
How did it go with the police?
They asked a million questions that I didn't know the answers to.
But the ones I did must have been enough.
Evelyn's gonna stand trial and I'll be a witness.
You're not wearing the ring.
I know about you and Evelyn.
I wouldn't blame you if you hated me.
James, I know what you were feeling.
I was feeling it too.
Evelyn just took advantage of it.
Well, it was wrong and I should've known that.
Look, it's okay for you to feel bad about what happened to you,
but I don't want you to feel bad for me.
If we could just start over again...
Please come home with me.
I can't. Not right now.
You're right. You should go.
But what about you?
Can't worry about me anymore.
I've been a part of all the horrible things
that have happened.
I wanna be a part of something good now.
James, go.
Take all the time you need.
I love you.
I'm gonna miss you like crazy.
But you'll go away
and you'll come back with great stories.
And none of them are gonna be about Laura or Maddy or Evelyn.
And I'll be here.
Come with me. No.
Well, then, I'll come back, I promise.
Coming.
Coming.
Pete, I need to see Josie. Come on in.
I think she's gone out. Yes, it's rather odd.
She took my car without saying a word.
Well, she told me the Great Northern.
Oh, did she? Well, she took a lot of things with her.
I don't know where she was going.
But I'd say she was planning to stay a while.
What else did she say, Pete?
Well, that she was going to see an old friend.
Who?
Sheriff, I suppose it's been very hard on all of us
learning the truth about Josie.
Catherine.
Who?
Eckhardt. Thomas Eckhardt.
Poor man.
Lobby, please.
Thomas.
We meet again.
I don't believe in ghosts.
Pity, it's an appealing notion.
The return of the grisly phantom from the grave.
You deserve haunting, to be sure.
Look closer, Thomas.
I'm alive!
How?
Guess. It's really very simple.
Josie.
She warned me off herself.
Couldn't bear to see her beloved husband perish.
Or more realistically, I suppose,
she felt there was some advantage to be gained.
She betrayed me.
We're all familiar with betrayal.
Josie is mine. She belongs to me.
Oh, Thomas, love will break your heart.
Happily, long ago, I lost interest.
But Josie loses her heart with alarming regularity.
The local sheriff, of all people.
I have taken care of that. I don't doubt it.
Sometimes I wonder if our Josie
does these twisted things deliberately.
Don't you?
As someone who was once your friend,
I come back with a warning.
Josie is coming back to you, be very careful.
I'm always careful.
Well, here we are, the lobby.
I'll be going back down to the garage.
My resurrection remains a well-kept secret.
Thomas.
Bye.
Hmm. I know that I have a lot to learn.
Jack,
you shall be my teacher.
Think of me as an open book,
upon whose virgin pages you shall scribe.
You okay? Mm-hm.
So, Mr. Wheeler, um, what is it exactly you do do?
First off, call me Jack, please.
I buy bankrupt, failing businesses.
I streamline them, bring them back up to speed
and then usually sell them.
At a substantial profit.
But not, I should add,
before making significant environmental concessions.
No, when Jack is finished, the waste is rerouted, the air...
The air is cleaner.
And the people happier.
Ben, you make me sound like Santa Claus.
I'm a businessman, that's all.
Hmm?
You'll have to excuse me, the chef just tried to stab Jerry.
You kids carry on.
Pay attention.
So, Mr. Wheeler,
which is it, are we bankrupt or just failing?
I came to do an old friend a favor. And it's Jack.
My father's friends are rarer than the pine weasel.
Well, let's just say
that Ben was once a very good friend to me.
So you came back to bring us all up to speed.
You are Santa Claus, Mr. Wheeler. I'd better hang up my stocking.
You don't like me very much, do you, Audrey?
I don't have an opinion either way.
But if you did?
If I did,
I'd say that the Hornes have managed to take care of themselves just fine
for more years than you can count.
And desperate though we may seem,
will probably continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
Indeed.
Where have you been all this time?
I mean, when you weren't busy rescuing widows and orphans
and making our world a better place to live in.
The far corners of the earth.
I tell you, it's glorious out there, Audrey.
All in all, it's good to be home.
I'm only 18.
And what exactly does that have to do with the price of eggs?
Nothing.
God, look at the time. I have an appointment.
Could you tell my father? Sure.
Okay. Um, see you.
Bye.
I'll see you later, Jack.
I'll see you, Audrey.
Hmm.
Shelly? Hi. Hi. How are you?
I'm okay. How are you doing?
You know life. Drag?
Are you waiting for James?
No.
Actually I got this really weird note.
Somebody wants me to meet them here.
That strange?
That is strange, look what I have.
It looks like we all have something to talk about.
It fits.
See the mountains kiss high heaven, And the waves clasp one another
No sister-flower would be forgiven If it disdain'd its brother
And the sunlight clasps the earth, And the moonbeams kiss the sea...
What is all this sweet work worth, If thou kiss not me?
This is weird. I'll say.
Cooper here. Yes, Catherine.
No, no, I was just on my way over.
She's here?
Thomas Eckhardt's suite.
I see.
Help!
Please help. I love you.
No! Josie. For God's sake...
Don't touch me. Don't touch me! Don't hurt me.
Stay where you are.
He tried to kill me.
Is that what you'll say about me, Josie? That I tried to kill you?
What about Jonathan?
Did he try to kill you too?
He was taking me back.
Why did you shoot me, Josie?
Because you came here.
I knew this day was going to come.
I'm not going to jail. I can't.
Put it down, Josie.
Harry. Put it down!
Harry, forgive me.
I never meant to hurt you.
Josie. Josie.
Josie.
She's dead.
Josie.
Coop, what happened to dead Josie?
Oh, Josie.
﻿1
One of Norma's breakfasts. Made special.
God bless Norma.
Maybe later. Maybe later, thanks.
How's things at the station?
Earle's chess game is the big concern.
The man has a poor sense of recreation.
Yeah.
We're holding up, for now.
Hey, you and Cooper can handle it. It's a pretty simple town.
Used to be.
I guess the world's just caught up to us.
Annie.
Hi. Hi.
Shelly, this is my sister, Annie.
Hi, Annie. Welcome. Norma's told me all about you.
All about me? Shelly's like family.
With our family, that's not exactly a character reference.
How did you and Mom get along?
Well, we can talk about her, or we can feel good about things.
I vote for plan B.
Me too. I'm glad you're here.
Feels a little strange. The real world.
Little things, like I'd almost forgotten how to use money.
Closest we'd get in the convent was bingo chips.
No charity, Norma. Promise.
Don't worry, I'm gonna work you till you drop.
Compelling.
Harry's about to hit bottom.
Is he eating?
When do you think he'll come back to work?
I guess we'll find out soon.
Need a hand?
That's a question I should be asking you.
You're the senior lawman, Cooper.
Let's just let the rain fall as it has been.
Besides, I hate paperwork.
This is worse than the Bureau, with all its international documentation.
Eckhardt, Josie...
This is the autopsy on her.
Doc Hayward said he couldn't determine cause of death.
The body only weighed 65 pounds.
How is that possible? I don't know.
Maybe something to do with what I saw in the room when she died.
Maybe we'd better just whistle on our way past the graveyard.
Yeah. Anything on Earle?
Trail's stone-cold. Still waiting for his response.
Slip. Slippers.
You know, Leo, you can't really appreciate
how tonic country life is until you're actually right here, living it.
Pipe? Splendid.
Mm.
Even if you've been to the country before,
when you try to imagine what it would be like to go back,
the image is imperfect.
The mental image is always imperfect.
Am I right?
Tacit agreement is acceptable, Leo.
Your silence speaks volumes.
Or if not volumes, at least the occasional unpunctuated paragraph.
Well, let's see what move our poor Cooper's come up with this time.
Uh-huh.
This isn't a move.
This is a trick.
He's playing a stalemate game.
Cooper doesn't know the meaning of stalemate!
He's getting help.
I cannot tolerate people who do not play by the rules.
People who shirk the standards!
Many people are going to regret this.
Got it?
Ladies, may I say,
you'll both delightfully represent
the sanctity of nature.
Cigarette?
I prefer to keep my chest clear.
Ah.
The great god, fitness.
Have you spoken with Pinkle? What's a Pinkle?
He's giving a talk on the pine-weasel.
The endangered animal. Oh, lovely.
What is it? A raccoon or something?
A ferret.
Audrey?
Oh, great. You two should coordinate.
You are dreaming.
Hello.
Looks like you're trying to run lumber upstream.
How can I help you, Mr. Wheeler?
Horne. Well, the talk that we had at dinner.
I can't... I'm sorry, I was rude, wasn't I?
It's just that when it comes to my family, I get a little excitable.
Who am I to waltz in out of nowhere? We need help. Anyone can see that,
and I can't think of anyone better qualified for the job than you.
Hello?
What are we talking about, anyway?
I was apologizing and you were apologizing.
We're both real sorry about something. You wanna go out somewhere?
Bad time, right? It's not good?
Oh, no, no, it's great.
How about a picnic?
Uh-huh. Um, we need outdoors stuff. A basket, blanket...
Food.
I don't know how to cook.
I'll bet you someone in the kitchen does.
This is just to show people what the pine-weasel looks like.
I understand the concept perfectly, Mr. Dinkle.
Pinkle. The name is Pinkle.
But what I'm trying to make clear is that using a stuffed animal
to represent an endangered species as an ecological protest
constitutes the supreme incongruity.
Well, that's clear, Dick.
Harry?
Hey, Coop.
We got Josie's dossier in from Interpol.
Not interested.
In addition to killing Eckhardt, trying to kill me
and killing Jonathan in Seattle... Closed cases.
...she's also wanted for a variety of felonies in Hong Kong.
I don't need to hear this.
She's also had two prostitution arrests, Harry.
Harry, eventually it's gonna help you to know she was a hardened criminal.
A killer.
Get out of here.
I know it's not easy right now.
Just get out of here.
Get out of here! Go!
The door was open.
A country habit. We're all so trusting.
My name is Jones.
I was executive assistant to the late Mr. Eckhardt.
Thank you.
I've come to expedite the transport of his body back to Hong Kong.
Tragic, what happened. You know, he really did love Josie.
Didn't we all?
They're going to be buried side by side.
So they can keep an eye on each other.
I guess you have your reasons to be bitter.
Oh, just call me a healthy skeptic.
Now, why did you really come to see me?
I came here to give you a gift. May I?
I don't think so.
Slowly.
From Thomas.
I have a few things to tidy up. Then I'll be leaving tonight.
Good luck, Mrs. Martell.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Bill or Eileen Hayward.
Well, they're not here right now. Can I help you?
Well, I'm Dr. Gerald Craig,
an old friend of Will's from medical school.
And, well, you see, I have a convention in Spokane,
and so I just thought I'd swing by and surprise them.
Which daughter are you?
Oh. Donna. Donna.
Would you like to come in, Dr. Craig?
I'd appreciate that.
Can I get you something to drink, Dr. Craig? A pop or something?
Thank you, no, no. Uh...
Is this your local paper?
Yeah. Pretty small town, huh?
Now, don't knock small towns until you've lived in the city.
Donna, you know,
it seems like Will has found himself a little piece of heaven here.
Now, don't you have two sisters?
Yeah, they're younger than me. Are they both as beautiful as you?
Heh. Well, I don't know.
You know, your dad and I, we used to sit around
and try to figure how our lives would work out.
And it seems like he's come a little closer to the mark than I have.
You're in high school? Unfortunately.
I felt exactly the same way. Heh.
You know, high school is difficult, you know.
You have no idea what you want to do with your life,
so it seems that absolutely none of it applies to your life.
You're right. Heh, heh.
Well, don't worry. It'll all work out.
For now, you just enjoy it in all its absurdity.
Okay.
Oh, I have a small gift for your dad.
Now, can I trust you not to open it?
Sure. Ha, ha.
You know, speaking of school,
Will and I graduated 30 years ago this month.
So I... It's a small remembrance for him.
Well, I should be on my way.
Oh, this is the number where I'm staying.
I hope to see you later, Donna.
Me too.
How are you holding up, Pete?
I've been through every stalemate game in recorded history.
And I've jerry-rigged a few of these country standoffs
that they don't write about in books.
But it's no use. I mean, there isn't a stalemate game on earth
that you don't lose at least a few foot soldiers.
I mean, the classic Herbstman.
You wind up with six pieces. Now, I can improve on that.
But even if I get there in half the time and wind up with 12,
that means six people die.
Do your best, Pete.
Windom Earle's genius carries with it the vice of impatience.
He doesn't want pawns. He wants royalty.
Protect those, particularly the queen, and we can frustrate him.
You can't do that.
My students.
Mr. Martell, Andy moved his knight without doing the little hook thing.
You don't have to do the little hook thing. That's optional.
Andy, the knight has to do the little hook thing.
Every time? It's a privilege.
No one else gets to make that move.
Okay, Mr. Martell.
I guess some people don't know quite as much as they think they do.
Check.
We thought it best we come see you.
As you know, that pattern on the back of my neck
appeared during my experience with...
Of course, no idea as to how it got there.
And you noticed it today?
My log noticed. I remember.
What do you remember, Margaret?
Look at the back of my leg.
I was 7 years old.
I went walking up in the woods,
and when I got back, I was told that I had disappeared for a day.
All I could recall was a flash of light,
and that mark was on my leg.
We all three recall the light.
And also the call of the owl.
Yes, I remember.
The only other time I saw that sight and heard that sound
was right before my husband died.
In the fire.
I'm connecting with something. Yes.
What?
I don't know.
Oh, bury me not
On the old prairie Where the coyotes howl
And the wind blows free
In a narrow grave Six-by-3
Don't bury me now
On the lone prairie
Um...
No one's ever sung a song to me before.
You must have been serenaded at least once or twice.
I don't inspire much singing.
Most boys are afraid.
Well, they don't know you, then.
Not really.
I don't think anybody really knows me.
It sounds like a warning.
I know.
If there's another guy...
There was someone, but not anymore.
There's nobody.
So, what do you wanna do now?
Know anymore cowboy tricks?
If you've got a lariat in that picnic basket,
I could lasso passing cattle.
I don't think there's a cow for miles.
Stray dogs, raccoons, birds, weasels.
You had a visitor.
Who's that?
Somebody you went to medical school with named Gerald Craig.
Gerald Craig? That's not possible, Donna.
Well, yeah. He said he was on his way to a convention in Spokane.
He knew everything about me.
Here's his number, and this.
Gerald Craig was my roommate.
He drowned on a rafting trip on the Snake River.
I was there, Donna. I tried to save him.
Well, then...
It's a cemetery.
Knight to King's Bishop 3.
That man, he's very dangerous.
Don't let him in here again, do you understand?
Sure. I've gotta take this to Cooper.
Nadine, what I'm here to say to you is, uh...
Seeing how you're with Mike now...
It's so cute the way you get embarrassed.
And, uh, since I have found someone else...
Nadine, I'm not sure you're gonna understand this.
Of course I understand, Eddie.
This isn't just a little spat.
Nadine, um,
do you know what Ed is suggesting?
It's not too obvious. We're not, like, talking relativity here.
We're breaking up. Major, final breakup.
Well, yes, technically, I guess it is a breakup, but, uh...
Well, it's a little more than that, Nadine.
Ed, you are so serious.
These are the dating years.
You're acting like this is some really big deal.
Doc?
Ed, there are no secret tricks or magic words.
It's like the dissolving of scar tissue around a wound.
She'll start to see reality again when her mind begins to feel safe.
Well, when will that be?
I can't say.
That tissue's packed in there pretty hard.
Okay. Well, one thing I really don't wanna see, Ed,
are any incidents with Mike. No jealous rages.
Well, maybe just one.
I give up.
Nadine, you and Ed are about to get a divorce.
I think I've gone blind in my left eye.
Shelly? Yeah.
Have you seen this?
Oh, "Miss Twin Peaks."
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
There's a cash prize and a scholarship.
I bet you could walk away with it. I don't think so.
It's easy, you give a speech, you answer a few questions...
Miss Double R Diner,
what would you do to bring about world peace?
Well, I would bring all the world leaders together,
make them form a circle and join hands.
Because you can't make a fist
holding hands. You're a shoo-in.
I have an order up.
Here's your burger.
What's with the dance?
Oh, heh, my boss told me I should enter a pageant. Miss Twin Peaks.
You can kid about it, but you are very pretty.
I think you should enter it.
Thanks, but I don't think of myself as pretty.
It's an inner thing, you know.
Would you like something to drink?
Yes, I'd like a cup of deep black joe, please.
Coming right up.
You must be Norma's sister.
I'm Annie.
How did you know? Dale Cooper. Local law enforcement.
Must keep you pretty busy.
Sure does.
Are you, uh, staying in town for a while?
I might be here quite a while.
It's happened to me.
Looks like it's grown on you.
It has a way of doing that.
I made it a little strong.
Okay.
You made it just right, Annie.
We've got a problem at the Book House.
Agent Cooper, Hawk, the sheriff's gone off.
He's broken every piece of furniture not nailed down.
I honestly don't know what to do.
It's okay, Andy.
Hey, Deputy Dale.
How's business?
Well, Harry, it's a little complicated at the moment.
That's the good thing about the law. It doesn't breathe. You can't kill it!
Harry, I've got an idea.
Why don't you hand me that gun?
I don't believe I've ever handed my gun over to anybody in my entire life!
This might be a damn fine time to start.
You know something else I've never done?
I've never crossed the ocean.
Never got to China.
She came to me.
And she made everything better.
Everything so much better.
Harry.
Your life is still your own. Josie didn't take that with her.
I should have gotten her away.
I should have taken her away from here!
I loved her.
She didn't have to die.
I don't understand.
There's a whole lot I don't understand.
We're all like that.
Have somebody keep an eye on him tonight.
I've never seen him like this.
It was like taking a hike to your favorite spot
and finding a hole where the lake used to be.
Josie had power.
A man who doesn't love easily loves too much.
A good man. The best.
Keep going.
That's a special honeymoon suite for Mr. and Mrs. Hinkman?
Uh, that's correct. Yes.
We're from Bozeman originally.
But my wife thought that it would be nice to see the countryside.
And, you know, you have some very pretty country here in Twin Peaks.
Will you be with us long? Not long enough.
No, just until tomorrow if that's okay, because we're going deep-sea fishing.
Oh, goody.
Okay, so we'll just be going on up now, me and...
Me and Mrs. Hinkman. Oh, is that Mike?
Susan, uh, how are you?
Fine. Um...
I'll see you at school.
The room, please.
I think we can handle the bags.
First of all,
I would like to thank all of you for this marvelous turnout.
It's very gratifying to see so many people
who are sincere about their environment.
The Stop Ghostwood campaign is a determined effort
to keep the rabid development interests from trying to turn
our beautiful Northwest forests into a monstrous amusement park,
destroying animal preserves which have been undisturbed for centuries.
The little worlds that serve as sanctums
for several endangered species,
not the least of which is the little pine-weasel.
Before moving along,
I would just like to remind all of us that ecology is not a luxury science.
It is not about pleasant appearances.
It is about survival.
About whether we are all going to make it, period.
But not to understate the value of visual pleasure,
we come to the fashion show.
Now, if any of you think you recognize some of the models,
it's because they are concerned members of the community
who have graciously given of their time tonight.
So, ladies and gentlemen, to kick things off, here is our host,
Richard Tremayne.
Thank you. Splendid gathering.
Our little Lucy is wearing a delightful
mix of warm Northern comfort and Southern insouciance.
An elegant worsted wool jacket over a plethora of plaid,
with a hint of polka dot.
It's fabulous, isn't it? A moonless night, black, slim skirt
with a look that always says, "Hey, world, I'm here."
Mr. Brennan is wearing a fire-engine-red turtleneck
beneath an all-wool plaid Pendleton shirt.
He completes this look with his red-and-black buffalo-checked jodhpurs.
For the man who wants to make a statement
while retaining that casual feel, whether he's out mastering a task
or riding the breeze of a chance meeting.
That's it, Andy.
At this rate, we're running late. So if we could all
sort of hurry Richard along with some quick movement out there.
I'm hot in this thing.
You're hot? I'm dressed like a sheep. All this worsted.
And I think Mr. Tremayne
is getting more than a little hot with all these girls.
Our next model... Go, go, go.
Well, if it isn't John Muir, friend of the redwoods.
Catherine, how good of you to come.
Ben, darling, who are you kidding with all this?
I am absolutely 100 percent sincere.
Oh, come on. Look who you're talking to.
We're in the same line of work.
You've always been a little more obvious, but this...
Catherine, ahem, have you ever, in your entire life,
had an experience that truly changed you?
Please, spare me the born-again sales pitch and level with me.
You can't hope to stop my development plans,
so, what do you actually expect to gain from all this?
A first scrubbing
on one of the dirtiest consciences in the entire Northwest.
And hopefully, it will happen to you.
Catherine,
I know what your plans for Ghostwood are.
And granted, I used to see life exactly the way you do.
And no matter how many deals I made or how much money I made,
inside, I was still a black, miserable clod of dirt.
I am finding that the one thing that really affords you joy in life,
the only authentic thing, is giving.
Don't wait until you're on your deathbed to find that out.
God help you.
You actually sound like you mean it.
I do. For you, for me, the future.
Catherine, why don't you take this opportunity
to transcend a lifetime of megalomania and egocentricity,
and write us a big fat check to help stop Ghostwood?
Mwah.
And now to introduce you to an endangered little critter
whose home is presently under attack
by the proposed Ghostwood development project, Mr. Tim Pinkle.
Thank you, Dick. Thank you, thank you.
Well, hi, how's everything going?
That's good.
Um, ladies and gentlemen, I have with me a little fellow
who doesn't understand the peril that awaits him.
An innocent in a world gone mad.
A world gone mad. Ahem.
Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the endangered pine-weasel.
Now, this species is of the weasel family.
And not only is he nonaggressive to us humans and has beautiful fur,
but also, he is by nature an excellent controller of rodents.
Unfortunately, this little friendly fellow is incredibly curious,
making him very easy for one to trap.
He is also attracted to bright shiny objects.
Must be my studs. Yeah. Oh. Oh.
It also is amazing, he is particularly attracted
to various smells, like, believe it or not, very cheap cologne.
Oh, what's this?
I think it wants to give you a kiss, Dick.
Oh, please, Mr. Pinkle. Come on. Come on.
It's all right, give him a kiss. A kiss?
Uh-huh. Attaboy. Come on.
Hello there, little pilgrim...
Oh, no, no, no.
Nobody panic. Don't panic. He's completely harmless.
He's already endangered.
Don't panic, anybody, just don't panic.
Nobody panic. Please, everyone, calm down.
Stay in your seat. Aah!
You all right? I'm fine.
Lot of fuss over a loose weasel.
Maybe we should help. I don't know.
A little excitement might do this crowd some good.
Did you come for the fashion show? No, I came for you.
﻿1
Do you like that?
Oh, Harry.
Josie.
Yes.
Yes, it's me.
I'm here.
Josie. Harry, I'm here.
Josie...
Room service.
Come on in. It's open.
You can just put it on the table.
Audrey.
I trust your sleep was untroubled?
Here at The Great Northern, we aim to make your stay
as comfortable and as enjoyable as possible.
You know, we take the concept of room service very seriously.
Oh.
Do you remember your grandfather?
Mm-hm.
Colorful man, one of the wisest I ever met.
You know what he once said?
He said if you're gonna bring a hammer, you better bring nails.
What's that supposed to mean?
What that means is the next time you come into my room
and carry on, you'd better be ready to finish
whatever it is you came here to start.
Maybe I'm ready now. Then be yourself.
I am being myself.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I stand corrected. You're a beautiful, intelligent young woman.
What else?
Uh...
You have an undeniable magic about you
that inspires a plan.
Flight at sunset and dinner for two?
When? What, the flight or the sunset?
Well, I have to go to the library and have a meeting with my father later.
A simple yes or no would do.
Yes.
And if you bring a hammer, you better bring some nails too.
Anything?
No, not a word. She wants to speak to the South African consulate.
In Twin Peaks?
Why would Eckhardt want me dead?
Sexual jealousy.
Oh, yeah. Mm-hm.
It's good to have you back, Harry.
Taken me a day or so to get my sea legs.
Well, to be honest, it looks like you went down with the ship.
Why don't you go home and recuperate?
No, all I need is some coffee, maybe a little food.
Sure-fire cure for a hangover, Harry.
You take a glass of nearly frozen, unstrained tomato juice.
You plop a couple of oysters in there, you drink it down.
Breathe deeply.
Next, you take a mound, and I mean a mound, of sweetbreads,
sauté them with some chestnuts and some Canadian bacon.
Finally, biscuits.
Big biscuits, smothered in gravy.
Now, here's where it gets tricky. You're gonna need some anchovies...
Excuse me.
That should do it.
The bonsai. The ultimate miniature.
Bicarbonate of soda, the ultimate digestive aid.
Harry, quaff in good health.
Thank you. Mm.
Where the hell did that come from?
It was delivered this morning.
It's from Josie.
Harry, Windom Earle was at my house.
Windom Earle. When?
Yesterday. He left this with Donna.
He's closing in, Harry.
Knight to King Bishop 3. What do we do?
We publish our next move today.
Thanks, Lucy.
Brace yourself, Harry.
Agent Dale Cooper. Gordon Cole.
Sure sorry to interrupt you fellas.
But, Coop, I'm bringing you the classified portion
of the Windom Earle dossier.
Back from Bend?
Been on over to Bend, Oregon.
Whole lot of shaking going on down in Bend.
Enter Gordon Cole.
This is so galling, Leo.
Young Dale is continually refusing to play fair!
When Earle went boi-oi-oing,
the doctors discovered he was on haloperidol.
The same drug the one-armed man, Gerard, was on.
What's that? Gerard used the same drug.
You got it.
But they figured he was using the drug to fake his illness,
just as you suspected, Coop.
Definite schizoid maneuvering.
"Project Blue Book"?
My God, Gordon, what was he doing on this?
The Bureau loaned Earle out to the Air Force in 1965.
Reports on his two-year hitch are blacked out. National security.
Wait a minute.
Earle was investigating UFOs?
Major Briggs, Harry.
Gordon, there are some curious linkages here.
The word "linkage" reminds me of sausage.
Never cared much for the links, preferred the patties.
But breakfast is a real good idea.
Bonsai.
Remember those old World War II movies?
Bonsai!
Damnation!
Good to see you again, doc. Sheriff, we'll be riding with you.
Cruiser's right outside.
Hold it one second there, Coop.
You'd better dust off your own black suit.
With Windom Earle rolling around loose on the deck,
we need you back on the team.
What are you saying, Gordon?
Coop, it gives me great pleasure to reinstate you
into the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Brand-new issue, more accurate and efficient.
Smith & Wesson, ten millimeter.
Model 1076, all stainless steel.
It's a beautiful weapon, Coop, and it's all yours.
Thank you, Gordon.
Cooper, we're gonna find Earle. We will pursue,
capture and incarcerate. Capture and incarcerate.
Let's hit the road.
Come on, buster, I'm buying.
On your tail, Gordon.
Now, Leo...
...pick three cards.
One,
two,
three.
Queen Donna.
Queen Audrey.
Queen Shelly, good.
Now, see if you can find the king.
Little Dale.
Now, we need one more queen.
Let's see.
The queen of hearts.
Let me see.
Miss Twin Peaks.
Now, what do you get if you win? You get a dozen roses,
a scholarship to the college of your choice,
the accolades of your peers...
Oh, yes, I know.
You get to die.
A royal execution.
And Cooper
gets to watch.
Hello, Ben.
I need to talk to you.
How was everything, sir?
Unbelievable.
Is Audrey Horne here? She's in the back. I'll get her for you.
Thanks.
Donna, hi.
Hi, Donna.
Hi.
Hi, Donna. Hi.
Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure.
This might sound a little strange.
What?
Would you know any reason why my mom's visiting your dad?
Not offhand.
Okay, well, yesterday he came by the house to see my mom.
And today she drove over here to see him.
Maybe she's just helping him with the Stop Ghostwood campaign.
No, she would have said something to me, and she hasn't said a word.
Is she here now?
They're in his office together.
No, I won't accept them.
They're your letters.
They were written to you.
I don't want them.
I won't have them in my house any longer.
You've had them for 20 years.
Why now?
That's just what I'm asking you. Why now?
They'll only succeed in ripping apart old wounds.
I can't bear the thought of it.
Eileen.
Eileen, why don't you believe me?
Words aren't good enough.
I want my actions to speak for me. Haven't you been listening?
I have been wrong all these years.
I am trying to make up for it.
Sometimes making up for things only makes it worse.
Oh, Eileen.
You should have been the best thing that ever happened to me.
Ben, please.
I haven't held you since that night.
Don't.
Oh, I wanna hold you.
I wanna go back.
God, if you'd just... Please, don't!
I'm sorry.
Have you told her? God, no.
Never. I never will. And you must promise me the same.
You mustn't come over again.
You must stay away from her.
I understand.
I hope you do.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't know.
But I'm gonna find out.
Harry, the best cure I ever came across for a hangover
was raw meat, and plenty of it.
You break an egg on it.
Add in some salted anchovies, Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce.
If you want, we can order up some for you.
Now that I come to mention it, Coop, you know what I'm in the mood for?
What's that, Gordon?
A steak so rare you could sell it at Tiffany's.
Well, you've come to the right place.
Good deal.
Holy smokes, who is that?
Shelly Johnson.
Shelly Johnson!
What a beauty.
Kind of reminds me of that statue, the babe without the arms.
Venus de Milo. The name was Milo,
but that's beside the point.
That's the kind of girl to make you wish you spoke a little French.
Excuse me, Coop, while I try my hand at a little counter Esperanto.
Good luck, Gordon.
Hello.
I was wondering if I might trouble you for a cup of strong black coffee
and in the process,
engage you with an anecdote of no small amusement.
The name is Gordon Cole,
and I couldn't help but notice you from the booth.
And, well, seeing your beauty now,
I feel as though my stomach is filled with a team of bumblebees.
You don't have to shout. I can hear you.
I heard that.
Um, do you want anything besides coffee?
I heard you perfectly.
And I can hear you, honest, please...
You don't understand.
You don't understand, Miss Johnson.
Do you see these? Uh-huh.
For 20 years, I've been asking people to please speak up,
but for some weird reason, I can hear you clear as a bell.
Say something else.
Um, uh...
Do you want pie with your coffee?
Good Lord. I can hear you perfectly.
This is like some kind of miracle. A phenomenon.
What's wrong with miracles? What's that?
This cherry pie is a miracle.
Would you please ask the lady with the log to speak up?
Um, the pie. She was talking about the cherry pie.
I heard you again. I heard you again.
Would you like some pie?
Massive, massive quantities.
And a glass of water, sweetheart. My socks are on fire.
Harry.
That looks like a chickadee on a Dodge Dart.
No, it looks like a finch on a Dodge Dart.
Nope, chickadee on a Dodge Dart.
Hi. Hi. Cup of deep black joe?
You bet.
What do you recommend for a hangover?
Teetotaling and prayer.
Good answer.
I'll try some coffee.
How are you today?
I'm fine.
I'm weird, actually.
I'm disoriented.
I'm not sure where I am. I mean, I know where I am,
but it feels odd being here.
I'm okay.
Okay.
Listen to me. I've been out of circulation so long,
I've completely forgotten the social niceties.
I mean, you ask me how I am,
I'm not really supposed to say how I am.
I'm supposed to say, "I'm fine, thanks. How are you?"
I'm fine, thanks.
You must think I'm really strange.
No.
Well, with due respect to the social niceties,
even if you did think I was strange, you wouldn't tell me, would you?
No, if I thought you were strange, I'd tell you.
And you don't think so?
Not a bit.
Good. Glad we got that cleared up.
So, what will you have?
I would like a chicken potpie and a large glass of milk, please.
Good choice. All the major food groups represented.
Turkey sandwich, whole wheat, lettuce, dollop of mayonnaise,
and I've got a joke for you.
Two penguins were walking across an iceberg.
One penguin turned to the second penguin and said:
"You look like you're wearing a tuxedo."
Annie?
I heard that.
Wait a minute. I'll be right back.
I wasn't quite finished.
How long you been in love with her?
Harry, who said anything about love?
Coop, you just tried to tell her a joke.
I did?
So, what did the second penguin say?
Well, the first penguin said to the second penguin:
"You look like you're wearing a tuxedo."
And the second penguin said, "Maybe I am."
The defense rests.
Do you want some more pie? A whole pie?
Yes, I would, Miss Johnson, and a piece of paper and a pencil.
I plan on writing an epic poem about this gorgeous pie.
Okay.
I see that you've been to Owl Cave.
Sorry?
Well, that design looks like the one up at Owl Cave.
Let me see that.
I combined Major Briggs' tattoo with the Log Lady's.
This looks exactly like the one at Owl Cave.
Harry, I've got to see this Owl Cave.
Dear Donna,
You were right, I had to go.
Everything feels different when you're on the road.
It feels better.
San Francisco's really cool.
Next stop, Mexico.
I'll be back with a million stories.
I promise.
I love you, James.
James?
How is he?
He's good.
He's doing what he needed to do.
He'll be back.
Dad, can I ask you something?
Sure.
How does Mom know Benjamin Horne?
I doubt that she does, Donna. Not very well.
He was over here yesterday.
They were talking like old friends.
Your mother works a lot with the local charities.
I'm sure even Ben contributes once in a while.
She drove to The Great Northern this morning to see him again.
Ah, probably something to do with a fundraiser.
I don't think so.
Yeah, that's exactly what it was. She told me at breakfast.
One of those heal-the-planet things.
Well, she didn't mention it to me.
Well, that's exactly what it was. That's what she told me.
I'll get it.
Hi, I have a delivery for Mrs. Hayward.
They said they're for Mom.
No card.
I'll put them in water.
Aah! Sorry, sorry, my fault. Heh.
Oh... I didn't hear you. No.
One should never allow one's mind and one's foot
to wander at the same time.
Edward Perkins. Once again, my apologies.
Audrey Horne. Nice to meet you, Mr. Perkins.
Mm-hm, mm-hm. So, what brings you to the library?
I'm doing research on civil disobedience.
Good for you. It is incumbent on the young to disobey.
Ha, ha. Are you a professor?
Well, I teach. Poetry is my area of expertise.
You're kidding. You know, someone sent me a poem. Maybe you know it.
Oh, perhaps I do. Now, let's have a look.
Oh. Hmm.
You read it.
Okay.
See the mountains kiss high heaven And the waves clasp one another
No sister-flower would be forgiven If it disdain'd its brother
And the sunlight clasps the earth And the moonbeams kiss the sea
What is all this sweet work worth If thou kiss not me?
Yeah, you know it.
Yes. Shelley.
What?
Gazing at you
reciting the verse of Shelley,
you look very much like a queen.
Thank you.
Um...
I guess I better be going. Nice meeting you.
Perhaps we'll meet again someday. Yeah.
Thinking of entering? Heh. No.
I think the real world's strange enough without getting on-stage
and parading around in a bathing suit and heels.
Guess the convent's not too big on that kind of stuff.
That's a good guess.
So, what's it like being back in civilization?
It's not like they kept us cooped up in an attic.
I mean, we had newspapers. We even had cable TV.
Every time I tell someone where I've been, they act like I'm out on parole.
Sorry.
You know what is weird? Being around men again.
Well, you don't have to spend time in a convent to feel that.
What do you know about Dale Cooper?
Are we interested?
Who said anything about that?
Well, judging by the look on his face when he saw you today,
I'd say you have a major opportunity.
Sorry, you have it all wrong.
I'm not even remotely interested.
Andy?
Yes, Lucy.
I wanna thank you for helping out during the weasel riot yesterday.
Which is more than I can say for a certain Dick we both know.
Keeping the peace is part of my job.
Where are you going with all of that gear?
Spelunking. Oh.
Is it dangerous? Spelunking?
Sometimes.
Promise me something?
Okay.
I know you'll be strong,
and I know you'll be brave,
but I want you to promise me that you'll be careful.
I'll be careful. You have my word.
Oh... dear.
All set, Harry?
Pete just called in our next move.
We expose a pawn to his bishop. Want me to hold off?
No, Pete knows what he's doing.
If he takes that pawn, he forfeits the bishop,
thus losing his initial advantage.
How you feeling?
Like someone pounded a railroad spike through my ear.
Then a descent into a cool subterranean cave
will be just what the doctor ordered.
Are you sure Cole's up for the climb?
Gordon's not coming with us.
Shelly took him up to Doc Hayward's to see about his hearing problem.
The old tuning-fork test.
Audrey?
When Jack Kennedy entered the White House,
he took his brother with him
because he trusted Bobby to tell him the truth,
even when it wasn't pretty.
When the Bay of Pigs went up in smoke, Bobby was there.
When the Russians moved their missiles into Fidel's backyard,
Bobby was there to help his brother shoulder through.
Sort of how Jerry's done that for you?
It's the unvarnished truth that I am looking for.
And I believe that you
are the best man for the job.
Me?
Audrey,
I know that I haven't been a very good father.
Oh, heck, who am I kidding?
When have I ever been anything but a sleazy, rapacious heel?
Well, Daddy, maybe when I was little, but...
Exactly. But I've changed.
And I am determined to be a better person.
The kind of father that you will respect someday.
When I think about Laura,
when I think about the mistakes that I've made,
I want to build a life in happiness for our whole family.
You, me.
Will you help me do that?
Please?
Daddy, I'm your man.
Sensational.
Audrey, pack a bag. Get out to the airport.
Your plane leaves in an hour.
My plane?
Oh, John. Just the man that I wanna see.
Hi, Ben. Hello, Audrey.
Daddy, um... Audrey, you better get a move on.
One hour. Audrey's on her way to Seattle tonight.
She's having a breakfast confab with the environmentalists.
We're going national with this... pine-weasel thing.
Oh. Great. That's great.
Daddy, I'm not sure I can leave on such short notice.
Now, here are the particulars. Time, place, so on.
Audrey, you bring us back good news.
Good news, heh.
Well, guess I better go.
Bye. Bye.
Travel safely, Audrey.
John.
Ah.
How are you, Ben?
I am filled to the brim with a feeling of goodness.
Like a Christmas tree all lit up inside.
But at the end of the day when I look in the mirror,
I have to face the fact that I really don't know how to be good.
You're off to a pretty fair start.
How do you do it, John? What's the secret?
Do you really think that I could learn to be good?
I don't see why not. Just keep your eye on your heart.
And always tell the truth.
Always tell the truth. Tell the hardest truth first, though.
Oh, always tell the hardest truth first. Oh, I love that.
John, that's terrific.
This truth business, it's clearly at the forefront of goodness.
Ben?
Hmm?
I'm falling in love with your daughter. Yeah, that's a hard truth.
Good example. It is the truth.
It is? Yep.
Oh, John.
John. Ben.
What a wonderful world we live in.
Come on, Andy. Get a good grip, Andy.
Do it. That's it, Andy.
Looking good. Hand over hand.
Almost there. Take it easy.
No, no, no. Don't look down. No.
Hang on, Andy. Don't look down.
Hang on. Don't look down!
Andy. You okay?
I'm fine.
Whew. Incredible.
We used to play here when I was a kid.
Pretended it was haunted by fierce ghosts.
Beer drinkers, by the look of it.
Where's the symbol?
This way.
It's right here.
There it is. Whoa.
Wow.
Two symbols combined into a larger whole.
But for what purpose?
I don't know.
Beats me.
The tattoos are the question.
This must be the answer.
It's stuck.
My pick, it's stuck.
Oh, my God.
Wow. Holy smoke.
Look at that.
What have I done?
Fellas, coincidence and fate figure largely in our lives.
It appears to be a petroglyph.
Harry, I have no idea where this will lead us.
But I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.
Good evening. Can I help you, young lady?
Yes, I would like something to drink, but I'm not exactly sure what.
Ladies seem to like the rum.
Rum. I would like to have a rum, please.
Uh, with? Tonic?
Diane, Thursday, 9:05 p.m.
I've just returned from a place called Owl Cave.
How I got there is a rather complicated story.
It all began with a pair of tattoos...
First one's on me.
Thank you.
Hello, Annie. Hi.
Can I get you something...? Oh. No, no. I have a rum and tonic.
I see.
One of the sisters used to put rum in her tea,
and I thought it sounded exotic, so...
This is all new to you, isn't it?
I feel constantly amazed, stunned.
Music and people,
the way they talk and laugh,
and the way some of them are so clearly in love.
It's like a foreign language to me.
I know just enough of the words to realize how little I understand.
Man, I would love to see the world through your eyes.
Why?
Oh, there's some things I might do different if I had the chance.
Me too.
You see, the thing is, I failed before and...
I'm just afraid it might happen again.
You wanna talk about it?
Not yet.
Maybe I can help.
Can you?
If you want me to.
I'm stubborn. Extremely willful.
I can handle that.
Some people think I'm strange.
I know the feeling.
I couldn't promise you that I would always make sense
or do things that you would expect me to do.
Annie, I don't expect anything.
Then I accept your kind and generous offer.
Good. I'm glad.
My, my, my.
What have we
here?
Could it be?
Yes.
The symbol inverted.
Now...
﻿1
Nighttime or daytime,
once you get a few feet into this place, you can't tell the difference.
Probably why it's all remained so untouched.
One step at a time, gentlemen. Keep your eyes peeled.
Over this way, to your right, Coop.
Harry, someone's been here already.
Look, they did our work for us.
Oh, my God.
I saw the same tracks outside the power station.
Weight shift to the left foot. A break in the heel.
Windom Earle.
What would Earle be doing here?
That's a frightening question to contemplate.
Andy, I'm gonna need
an accurate large-scale rendering of this petroglyph.
Harry, let's get Major Briggs on the horn.
You want him to meet us at the station?
That's the ticket.
Once upon a time, there was a place of great goodness
called the White Lodge.
Gentle fawns gamboled there amidst happy, laughing spirits.
The sounds of innocence and joy filled the air.
And when it rained, it rained sweet nectar that infused one's heart
with a desire to live life in truth and beauty.
Generally speaking, a ghastly place, reeking of virtue's sour smell.
Engorged with the whispered prayers
of kneeling mothers, mewling newborns,
and fools, young and old, compelled to do good without reason.
But I am happy to point out that our story does not end
in this wretched place of saccharine excess.
For there's another place. Its opposite.
A place of almost unimaginable power,
chock-full of dark forces and vicious secrets.
No prayers dare enter this frightful maw.
Spirits there care not for good deeds or priestly invocations.
They are as like to rip the flesh from your bone
as greet you with a happy good day.
And if harnessed, these spirits in this hidden land
of unmuffled screams and broken hearts
will offer up a power so vast
that its bearer might reorder the earth itself to his liking.
Now, this place I speak of is known as the Black Lodge.
And I intend to find it.
Hey, man,
the story's cool,
but you promised me beer.
You told me there was gonna be a party.
I mean, White Lodge, Black Lodge? I mean, what's the big deal?
In time, young man. Everything in time.
I think that I shall never see a girl as lovely as Josie.
When she walks into a room,
the flowers all stood up,
to room,
doom,
fume, gloom...
I think that I shall never see a girl as lovely as Josie.
When she walks into a room, the flowers were all abloom.
Oh, Josie. Oh, stop your incessant moping.
Give me a hand with this damn box.
What exactly would you like me to do?
Open it. I've been trying for days.
Thomas Eckhardt left this to me when he died.
And I want it opened, I want it opened now.
Well, let's have a look-see here.
Do you have a key?
If I had a key, it would be open, don't you think?
Well, it doesn't even have a keyhole.
It's a puzzle box.
I saw one of these at a crafts emporium on Guam.
I was there taking a little R and R with the Doolittle twins. Heh.
There was a monkey show you wouldn't believe,
and Dale Doolittle... Now, he was the larger of the two...
Come to think of it, for twins, they weren't all that much alike.
Peter!
Sorry, poodle.
The trick is to fit the pieces together just so.
And how long will it take?
Well, this could take years.
Shel, I've been doing a lot of thinking about the future.
And what it takes to get ahead in the world.
I'm reading up, watching TV, suddenly it hits me: boom.
The secret to success.
Beautiful people get everything they want.
Oh, Bobby. Yeah, think about it.
When's the last time you saw a beautiful blond
go to the electric chair?
Eh...
You are very beautiful, Shelly.
And I think it's time we took advantage of this beautiful people's conspiracy.
Know any senators I can marry?
Check it out.
Miss Twin Peaks.
Once we get that crown on your head, baby, the sky is the limit.
Dream on, Bobby, I have tables to wait on.
Shelly, listen, don't argue with me.
Bobby's in charge, you understand?
We have to enlist by this afternoon.
There's, uh, something I want you to do for me, darling.
I'll do anything that body and mind can stand.
Surely the last few days have been proof of that, eh?
Oh. Heh.
You just name it.
Um...
I wanna win the Miss Twin Peaks contest.
You just name it.
I wanna win the Miss Twin Peaks contest.
Oh, of course.
Well, I've been known to make a speech or two in my time. Heh.
I'll coach you day and night.
Oh, now, sweetheart. Baby, that's not what I'm talking about.
Now, you're one of the judges.
You can guarantee it.
But... But, uh...
It would be wrong.
Well, now, darling...
Darling, it would be love.
That's all.
You know, I'd do anything for you, Lana.
You know that.
Yes, lover, I do.
Good morning, Annie. Hi. Breakfast?
I've got four hungry lawmen out in the police cruiser.
We need donuts and coffee. Hot.
Two black, two white, no sugars, please.
Coming right up. Oh, and Annie?
I'd like to take this opportunity to ask you
if you'd like to accompany me on a nature study this afternoon?
Nature study?
Sure.
How wonderful.
What?
When I talk to you, I get a tingling sensation
in my toes and in my stomach.
That's interesting.
I don't think it has anything to do with coffee.
I'll get those donuts. Thanks.
Shelly?
You are beautiful, got it?
Use it to your advantage.
"What is all this sweet work worth,
if thou kiss not me?"
I beg your pardon?
Oh, it was an anonymous poem someone sent me.
Shelly, I need to see this poem immediately.
Okay.
It was in three pieces, we each got a piece.
Donna, Audrey and me. Thank you.
I need to keep this.
Okay. Thank you.
A dozen donuts, four cups of coffee, two black, two white, no sugar.
Thank you.
Agent Cooper? Yes.
Uh, this afternoon?
I'll meet you right here. Four o'clock sharp.
"Mountains kiss.
Waves clasp.
Flower..."
What's this all about?
It's a poem, Harry. Torn into thirds.
Sent to Shelly Johnson, Audrey Horne and Donna Hayward
from Windom Earle.
You mean Earle's contacted all three girls?
Are you sure?
See the mountains kiss high heaven And the waves clasp one another
No sister-flower would be forgiven If it disdained its brother
A poem I once sent to Caroline.
I hope it's nothing more than a taunt, Harry.
Earle takes perverse pride in his ability to insinuate himself into innocent lives.
Well, let's talk to the girls as soon as we can.
See what they remember.
Donna Hayward's poem.
Audrey Horne is in Seattle. She won't be back till tomorrow.
Major Briggs is here in the conference room.
Hawk?
Would you please bring me Leo Johnson's arrest report?
Leo?
What's going on?
Putting the pieces together, Harry.
Deputy Brennan?
As I remember, the line you are drawing
should proceed downward, not across.
How did you know that?
Major Briggs? Thank you, sir, for coming in.
Major, we need your help.
But I am unable to accurately describe for you how or why.
Go on.
The Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department is currently involved
in several disparate investigations.
The disappearance of known felon, Leo Johnson.
The appearance of my former partner
and suspected murderer, Windom Earle.
And the discovery of petroglyphs of an unknown origin
in a place called Owl Cave.
Now, it would seem logic would dictate
that these investigations be considered separate entities.
However, I believe otherwise.
I believe that these mysteries are not separate entities,
but are in fact, complementary verses of the same song.
Now, I cannot hear it yet.
But I can feel it.
And that is enough for me to proceed.
How exactly may I help you?
I need to know everything that there is to know
