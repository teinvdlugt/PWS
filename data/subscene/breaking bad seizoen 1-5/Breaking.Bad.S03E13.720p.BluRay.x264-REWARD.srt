1
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,963
- Well, hello again.
- Hi, I hope we're not too late.

2
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,798
- No, no. Perfect timing.
- Okay.

3
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,967
- Stan, this is my husband, Walt.
- Hi.

4
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,136
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,430
- Sandia Laboratories, huh?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,141
I hear some fascinating stuff
goes on out there.

7
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,934
Yeah, well, you know.

8
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,228
Working on anything
you can talk about?

9
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,273
I'm picturing giant space lasers.
Am I right?

10
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,276
Honestly, what I do
would bore you senseless.

11
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:13,156
Giant space lasers? That sounds cool.
I'll bring it up at our next staff meeting.

12
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,492
- Well, just remember I get a cut.
- All right. It's a deal.

13
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,787
So this is it, honey. What do you say?
Wanna take a tour?

14
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,956
- Sure.
- Okay.

15
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,002
Look, how about
I give ya'll some privacy?

16
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:30,757
I'll go out to the car, make a few calls.
Take as much time as you need.

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,718
- All right.
- Okay, thanks.

18
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,973
- He's a nice guy. He doesn't push.
- Yeah.

19
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:43,811
So as you can see,
there's this kind of flow going on here.

20
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,855
- It's a nice big living room.
- Yeah.

21
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:49,817
And this is the dining area.

22
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:54,322
- Oh, the dining area. Right.
- Yes. Oh, and...

23
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,449
...it's got a pool.

24
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,285
Pool is nice.

25
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:02,288
Backyard could be a little bigger.

26
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:07,502
And... Oh, there's a breakfast bar
kind of dealie here, which is nice.

27
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,630
And, I don't know,
the kitchen's really spacious...

28
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,674
...and, you know,
got good appliances and...

29
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,551
How many bedrooms?

30
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,678
Three. Told you.

31
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:21,974
They're all pretty good size and...
Oh, this is the first one here.

32
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,560
And then there's two more
at the back.

33
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,729
Only three bedrooms?

34
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,690
We're gonna need at least five,
don't you think?

35
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,359
- Five?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:34,237
What, do I look like
I'm about to drop a litter?

37
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:39,826
No, no, no.
We'll have three kids total, eventually.

38
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,537
Yeah, but we'll need
a spare room for a study...

39
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,873
...so that I can work at home
and you can write.

40
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:50,878
Yeah, no.
I don't think this is gonna be enough.

41
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,049
Okay, what about a wine cellar?

42
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:59,053
I mean, we certainly cannot be
expected to live without a wine cellar.

43
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:03,224
Very funny. I just think we need
to set our sights high is all.

44
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:08,396
- At least, higher than here.
- Walt, this is a good neighborhood.

45
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,732
It's got a good elementary
and a very good high school...

46
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,904
...and believe me, because I have
definitely looked everywhere.

47
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,782
For our price range,
this is as good as it gets.

48
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,952
Well, then let's stretch our price range.

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,871
Truly. I mean, why?

50
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:29,250
Why buy a starter house when we'll
have to move out in a year or two?

51
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,752
Did you win the lottery
and not tell me?

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,754
I'm serious.

53
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,425
Come on. Why be cautious?

54
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,469
We've got nowhere to go but up.

55
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,064
- Yeah.
- Walter, you see us?

56
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,774
Yeah. I see you.

57
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:03,904
I'd like you to exit your vehicle
and start walking toward us.

58
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,992
And then what?
I'm gonna need some...

59
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,245
Some kind of assurance.

60
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,415
I assure you,
I could kill you from way over here...

61
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,293
...if it makes you feel any better.

62
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,142
Walter, you've been busy.

63
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:19,146
You wanna put your arms out
to your sides for me, if you would?

64
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,957
You know I haven't slept
since Thursday?

65
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,127
I was out all night
cleaning up after you.

66
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,129
I need my sleep.

67
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,341
You said no half measures.

68
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:53,180
Yeah. Funny how words can be so open
to interpretation.

69
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,351
- You get your car fixed?
- Not yet.

70
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,854
You're gonna wanna
get your car fixed.

71
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,982
Let's see how this goes first.

72
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,852
Has your condition worsened?

73
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,855
- Excuse me?
- Your medical condition.

74
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,941
- Has it grown worse?
- Not that I know of, no.

75
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,736
Is there a ringing in your ears?

76
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,447
Are you seeing bright lights
or hearing voices?

77
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:57,411
- I'm quite well, thank you.
- No. Clearly, you are not.

78
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,956
No rational person would do
as you have done.

79
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,044
Explain yourself.

80
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:11,050
My partner was about
to get himself shot.

81
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,718
I intervened.

82
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,304
Some worthless junkie.

83
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,599
For him, you intervene
and put us all at risk.

84
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,603
Some contemptible junkie who couldn't
keep the peace for eight hours.

85
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,272
That's right. He couldn't.

86
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,942
He was angry
because those dealers of yours...

87
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,277
...had just murdered
an 11 -year-old boy.

88
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,321
I heard about it.

89
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,282
He should have
let me take care of them.

90
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,243
Maybe.

91
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,580
Then again, maybe he thought
it was you who gave the order.

92
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:50,130
Are you asking me
if I ordered the murder of a child?

93
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,426
I would never ask you that.

94
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,850
Where is Pinkman now?

95
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,105
I wouldn't know.

96
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,817
Couple of time zones away, at least.

97
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,362
Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.

98
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,992
He has enough money to last forever,
he knows he needs to keep moving.

99
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,785
You'll never find him.

100
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,829
I don't know, Walt...

101
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,249
...it's what I do, after all.

102
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,211
He's out of the picture.

103
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,507
I saved his life, I owed him that,
but now he and I are done.

104
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,844
Which is exactly what you wanted,
isn't it?

105
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,852
You've always struck me
as a very pragmatic man.

106
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,522
So if I may,
I would like to review options with you.

107
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,568
Of which, it seems to me,
you have two.

108
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,778
Option A:

109
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,822
You kill me right here and now.

110
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,908
Apparently,
I have made that very easy for you.

111
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,703
You can kill me, no witnesses...

112
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:06,707
...and then spend the next few weeks
or months...

113
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,710
...tracking down Jesse Pinkman
and you kill him too.

114
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,340
A pointless exercise, it seems to me,
but that is option A.

115
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,175
What is option B?

116
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,718
I continue cooking.

117
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,763
You and I both forget about Pinkman.

118
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,223
We forget this ever happened.

119
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,060
We consider this a Ione hiccup...

120
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:31,065
...in an otherwise long
and fruitful business arrangement.

121
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,235
I prefer option B.

122
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,078
You'd need a new assistant.

123
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,456
- I could get right on that.
- No.

124
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,917
This time, I choose.

125
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,768
Your car...

126
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,603
...get it fixed.

127
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,397
Yeah.

128
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,646
Really?

129
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,717
It's good to see you.

130
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,179
Thanks.

131
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,432
It's good to be back.

132
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,310
Well, shall we?

133
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,481
By all means, Gale, let's cook.

134
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,035
What about that rhinoceros?
You think he'd make a good pet?

135
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,870
- No.
- No?

136
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,706
Don't you think if you called,
he'd come running?

137
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,876
I bet he would.
I bet he'd come running:

138
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,878
You're silly, Pop-Pop.

139
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,173
Well, a little. But he'd probably
knock everything over.

140
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,928
- Plus, there's that big nose of his.
- That's not a nose, that's a horn.

141
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:10,349
- Is that so?
- His real nose is little.

142
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,853
I learn all kinds of things
being with you.

143
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,067
Okay, June bug, these are for you.

144
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,569
- What about the rest?
- The rest are for me.

145
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,239
No, they're not.
You're too old for balloons.

146
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:30,911
You're never too old for balloons.
Give me a hug.

147
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,372
I see your mama.
Don't keep her waiting.

148
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,041
- Bye, Pop-Pop.
- Bye, baby.

149
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,378
Hi, sweetie.
Did you have fun with Pop-Pop?

150
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,878
Please. Please, no.

151
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,459
Chow, you have anything
you wanna tell me?

152
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,420
Thank God you're here.
They keep me prisoner.

153
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:12,466
- They keep you prisoner.
- I don't do nothing for them ever.

154
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,802
They try and make me. I say, no.

155
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,141
They steal my chemicals.
I can't stop them. I am businessman.

156
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,810
You're a business...
The lady out front...

157
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:27,606
Hey, lady, are you still there?
Ask her if she's still there.

158
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,955
She says, yes.

159
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,835
How's her driving? Driving.
Is she good behind the wheel?

160
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,505
Good. She's good driver.

161
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,341
Licensed? Dependable?

162
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:55,842
She has a Camry.

163
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,636
Good.

164
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,684
The trucks will be here
first thing in the morning.

165
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,688
I strongly recommend
that you return our calls next time.

166
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,024
So have her drive you to the hospital.

167
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,323
She's gonna need her shoe.

168
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,045
- Where'd they cross?
- Laredo, looks like.

169
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,881
They didn't exactly send
their A players.

170
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,051
But like you said, it's cartel, all right.

171
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,222
Probing for weakness.

172
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,017
Well, they didn't find any.

173
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,897
What about Pinkman?

174
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,359
I'm making inquiries.

175
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:14,045
Yeah, that's two.
All right, let's close it up.

176
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,430
All right, bring it down.

177
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,224
You ready?

178
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,981
Okay, we're good.

179
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,114
You can take your mask off now.

180
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,084
Does that guy ever leave?

181
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,965
When exactly did that start?

182
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,384
It's new.

183
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,012
We had a...

184
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,808
We had a little drama
with the person you replaced.

185
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,270
- Sorry to hear that.
- No, it'll be fine.

186
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,649
Things will continue
to smooth out and...

187
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,193
Yeah, it'll be fine.

188
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:25,200
By the way, if you're at all worried
about working with me...

189
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,327
No, I'm not.

190
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,537
Whatever my shortcomings
last time...

191
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,999
...I intend for things to go perfectly
from here on out.

192
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,836
- So if there is...?
- Gale, you're great.

193
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,673
- Seriously.
- I just...

194
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,011
However you like things to be done
is exactly how we're gonna do them.

195
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,013
Period.

196
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,725
From here on out, so...

197
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,437
Please, teach me.

198
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,821
Okay.

199
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,113
Gale. It's good to see you.

200
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,948
Mr. Fring.

201
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,784
Wow, this is...

202
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,245
I should have called.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

203
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,458
No. No, no, not at all.
Please, come in.

204
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,921
Can I offer you something?
A crème de menthe?

205
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,799
No. No, thank you.

206
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,468
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

207
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:52,847
Oh, no, no. It's no inconvenience.

208
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,851
I need to talk to you
about something.

209
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,479
Something rather pressing.

210
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,361
If push came to shove,
I was wondering...

211
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,490
...how soon you might be able
to take over the lab yourself.

212
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,826
You and an assistant.

213
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,286
Why would?

214
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:20,667
- Why would push come to shove?
- Has Walter ever talked to you...

215
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:24,504
...about why he got into
this particular line of work?

216
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,008
I guess I assumed
it was because it pays so well.

217
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,845
It is, but specifically...

218
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,014
...has he ever spoken to you
about his health problems?

219
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:42,105
I'm not surprised.
He's a very private person.

220
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:45,567
What exactly
are his health problems?

221
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,027
He's dying of cancer.

222
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:53,491
It is why he does this, to provide for
his family, which he's accomplished.

223
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,871
They will never want for anything,
he's seen to that.

224
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,626
How long does he have?

225
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,881
That is very much the question.

226
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:12,427
He does not wanna talk about it.
And every time I bring it up with him...

227
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:19,184
I don't know that he's fully accepted
the reality of it.

228
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,147
And not to sound cold-blooded,
but I am running a business here.

229
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:29,360
- No, I understand.
- I have a very large investment in this.

230
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,697
There's so much overhead
that I can't afford to shut down.

231
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,240
Not even for a week.

232
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:37,869
So you understand my concern.

233
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,080
And my desire for continuity.

234
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,749
I do. Absolutely.

235
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:47,128
Now, I intend to keep Walter on
as long as he wants...

236
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:51,257
...assuming that
he's physically up to it.

237
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:57,138
But as he cannot or will not tell me
how long that might be...

238
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:02,227
...I must prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

239
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,480
Well, worst-case scenario...

240
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,781
I suppose if we had...

241
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,243
...at least a few more cooks together.

242
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,579
You don't think you're ready now?

243
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,957
Well, I mean...

244
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,626
...he is such a...

245
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,003
A master.

246
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,465
There's always more for me to learn.

247
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:39,472
But I'm thinking that if we had...

248
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,432
...say...

249
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,851
...one or two more cooks.

250
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,733
One more...

251
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,778
...I guess would do it. I suppose.

252
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:57,448
I believe in you, Gale.

253
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:03,162
I know that when the time comes,
you will be ready.

254
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,845
What's up?

255
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,146
Walt, is there?

256
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:37,697
Any particular trick
to purging the catalyst bed?

257
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:44,704
No, it's pretty straightforward.
I'll show you when we get there.

258
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,315
Yeah?

259
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,734
Tell him I'm in conference.

260
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,953
- I'm in conference.
- I'm looking to find a client of yours.

261
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,915
I was hoping you could help me out
with an address.

262
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:32,251
- Which client?
- Jesse Pinkman.

263
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,546
Jesse-Pinkman-in-the-phone-book
Jesse Pinkman.

264
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,258
How would one track him down,
I wonder.

265
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,264
- You're still here.
- I need your full attention, Saul.

266
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,600
Jesse Pinkman.
Current whereabouts.

267
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:51,479
The sooner you tell me, the sooner
you get back to whatever this is.

268
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,941
What am I, an 8th-grade hall monitor?
Current whereabouts.

269
00:28:55,109 --> 00:29:00,279
- Let me tell you something, Mike, you...
- Whoa, you are good right there.

270
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,616
Now, let's both get comfortable.

271
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,747
Now, when I say,
I'm looking for Pinkman...

272
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,250
...we both know why, don't we?

273
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:17,880
You pretending otherwise only wastes
my time and serves to annoy me.

274
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:19,507
Look, Mike...

275
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,468
...there are rules to this lawyer thing.

276
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,679
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

277
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,265
Attorney-client privilege.
That's a big one.

278
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,600
That's something I provide for you.

279
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,644
So if I give up Pinkman...

280
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:35,314
...then you're gonna be asking,
"Saul gives them up pretty easy.

281
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,025
What's to keep him
from giving me up?" You see?

282
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,153
So then, where's the trust?

283
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:44,824
I trust the hole in the desert
I'd leave you in.

284
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,495
Yeah, that's an argument.

285
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,664
Saul...

286
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:56,127
...don't make me beat you
till your legs don't work.

287
00:29:56,503 --> 00:30:00,631
Now tell me where to find him.
You know it's the right thing.

288
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:09,182
I can't tell you, Mike, all right? I...

289
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:15,354
Look, if I was to tell you, well, I just...
I couldn't live with myself.

290
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,190
I'm sorry.

291
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:23,196
But who's to say I didn't write
the address down in my day planner?

292
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,866
Or on a scratch piece of paper
somewhere?

293
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,994
Who's to say
I didn't write down a location...

294
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,498
...strictly for
my own professional use?

295
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,753
Do not touch anything on my desk.

296
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,965
I'm gonna leave the room,
make myself a Nescafé.

297
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:03,903
I'm just looking out for you, that's all.
Like a mother hen.

298
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:09,242
Money-laundering ain't what it used
to be. God, do I miss the '80s.

299
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:13,704
You're wasting your time.
I'm buying the car wash, end of story.

300
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,625
Well, one look at this place,
you're gonna fall in love, so...

301
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:38,229
Was I right? Where else you gonna find
a cash-only business that's this fun?

302
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:43,442
Unless we're talking massage parlors,
and, I don't see it. Shall we?

303
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,619
You ever actually play laser tag?

304
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,915
You know, it's good cardio.
Plus, you get to shoot at kids.

305
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,343
You got your bumper cars over there
down that way.

306
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,179
Got your arcade here,
all the latest video games.

307
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:16,350
Snack bar's there. Nothing stopping
you from selling beer to the parents.

308
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,689
- That's a whole new revenue stream...
- All right, already. We're good.

309
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,609
Holy Christ.

310
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,820
We're good? This constitutes good
where you're from?

311
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,823
- My car is bugged?
- I said, maybe. Maybe bugged.

312
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:34,201
I'm being followed?
What the hell have you gotten me into?

313
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,289
My own PI is threatening to break
my legs. That's like Thomas Magnum...

314
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,667
...threatening that little prissy guy
with the mustache.

315
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:45,171
Over and above.
Service-wise, this is over and above.

316
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,340
You and I survive this...

317
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,009
...I'm seriously rethinking
my pricing, yeah.

318
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:53,346
And that goes double for you,
Hip-Hop.

319
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,348
Okay, my guy's no dummy, right?

320
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:59,894
I give us maybe 24 hours before he
figures out that address goes nowhere.

321
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,813
You guys do your thing,
make it snappy.

322
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,359
I'll go see if they have "Tetris"
or something.

323
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,118
So how you holding up?

324
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,623
You?

325
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,167
I got my old job back.

326
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,671
At least until they kill me
and Gale takes over.

327
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:31,509
- So he's their boy, huh?
- He's their boy.

328
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,053
How long you think you've got?

329
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:39,392
Well, he asks a lot of questions
about the cooking process.

330
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,729
I try to be as vague as possible,
but I got that guy Victor watching me...

331
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,524
...listening to every word I say.

332
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:52,029
You know, maybe that the only thing
saving me is Gale's fastidiousness.

333
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:57,159
And once he feels confident
that he knows my entire method...

334
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,583
So, what do we do?

335
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,589
You know what we do.

336
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,767
There's got to be some other way.

337
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:27,106
Maybe it's better for you
to just go to the cops.

338
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:32,486
All right? I mean,
I can't believe I'm saying that and all...

339
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,655
...but for your family.

340
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:38,951
The DEA would love you,
all the shit you could tell them.

341
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,121
Federal witness protection,
that's a good deal.

342
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:47,293
As for me, I'll hit the road, yo.
I mean, I'll make it.

343
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,964
We had a good run.

344
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,134
But it's over.

345
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,347
Never the DEA.

346
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,477
The cook can't stop.

347
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:08,981
That's the one thing I'm certain of,
production cannot stop.

348
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,442
Gus can't afford to.

349
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:15,154
So if I'm the only chemist
that he's got...

350
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,658
...then I've got leverage,
and leverage keeps me alive.

351
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:23,245
It keeps you alive too.
I think I can see to that.

352
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:28,959
If I'm the only chemist that he's got.

353
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:42,473
I can't do it, Mr. White.

354
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,060
Like you said, I'm...

355
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,188
I'm not a...

356
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,817
I can't do it.

357
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,366
I'll do it.

358
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:06,539
I'm gonna need your help.

359
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,916
I mean,
they're watching me day and night.

360
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,378
They never leave me alone with Gale,
not for a moment.

361
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:15,172
Hell, I don't even know
where the man lives.

362
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:19,093
He's not in the phone book,
I can't find him on the Internet...

363
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:23,055
...and I can't do it in the lab,
Victor's always there.

364
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,101
But if I could just...

365
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,271
...shake Victor,
for even an hour one night...

366
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,898
...I think then that...

367
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,693
I may be able...

368
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,073
...to make it look like an accident.

369
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,620
There's got to be some other way.

370
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,707
I'm all ears.

371
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,753
But when it comes down to you and me
versus him, I'm sorry.

372
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,548
I'm truly sorry...

373
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,759
...but it's gonna be him.

374
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,431
Now, you are the only edge
that I've got...

375
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,559
...as long as they don't know
that you're in town.

376
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,104
But I need you to track him,
get me his address.

377
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,440
And I'll do the rest.

378
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:25,117
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.

379
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,082
Are you gonna save mine?

380
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,656
Yeah?

381
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,533
Please, tell me you found him.

382
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:53,372
6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard.
Apartment 6.

383
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:59,378
- You there?
- Yeah.

384
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,882
6353 Juan Tabo. Number 6. Got it.

385
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,722
- He's home?
- Yep.

386
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,224
Anyone watching the place?

387
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,978
No. Looks pretty much wide-open.

388
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:18,397
When are you gonna do it?

389
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,403
Tonight.

390
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,739
Once it gets dark.

391
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:33,078
Don't do this, Mr. White.

392
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:37,416
Please. Go to the cops.

393
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,657
We got a problem.

394
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,619
Some kind of chemical leaking
in your lab.

395
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,454
Better come with me.

396
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,959
I'll follow you.

397
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,255
They tell me to bring you, I bring you.
Come on, get in the car.

398
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,365
I don't know if it's a barrel leak...

399
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:36,827
...but you got something
mighty stinky down there.

400
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,499
After you.

401
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:49,882
Walter, the sooner you figure out what
this is, the sooner we all go home.

402
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,680
Please, don't do this.

403
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,891
Mike...

404
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,685
...you don't have to do this.

405
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,856
Yeah, unfortunately, I do, Walter.

406
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,608
Downstairs.

407
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:12,070
I'll cook. I'll cook for free. There won't
be any more trouble, I promise you.

408
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,906
- No.
- If I could talk to Gus...

409
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,949
- No.
...I can make him understand.

410
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,452
If I could talk to Gus,
I can convince him.

411
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,537
Just let me, please... Please.

412
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:24,458
- Please, let me talk to him.
- Shut up! Shut up.

413
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,463
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

414
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,760
I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.

415
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:38,430
Like you said, he's the problem.
He's always been the problem.

416
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:42,392
And without him, we would...
And he's in town, all right?

417
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,270
He's not in Virginia
or wherever you're looking.

418
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,774
He's right here in Albuquerque
and I could take you to him.

419
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:51,276
I'll take you right to him.

420
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,948
- What do you say?
- Where is he?

421
00:42:56,115 --> 00:43:00,118
- Right now, you give me an address.
- I don't... He moves. He moves around.

422
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,080
But if you let me call him...
No, no, please.

423
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,958
No, I just... My phone. I'll just...

424
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:10,295
It's just my phone. I'll call him
and I'll have him meet me.

425
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,631
All right? Okay?

426
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,466
Okay?

427
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,257
Did you do it?

428
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,845
Mr. White?

429
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,180
Did you do it?

430
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,683
No, I didn't do it.

431
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,686
I can't now.

432
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:12,024
- It's gonna have to be you.
- What? No way, man.

433
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,360
You're closer than we are.
You'll have a 20-minute lead.

434
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,196
They've got me,
they're going to kill me.

435
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,574
- Jesse, do it now! Do it!
- Son of a bitch!

436
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,034
Do it, Jesse! Do it!

437
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,003
Just what the hell was that exactly?

438
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,921
You might wanna hold off.

439
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,548
Yeah?

440
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:40,677
- Why?
- Because your boss is gonna need me.

441
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:47,517
6353 Juan Tabo, Apartment 6.

442
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,105
Yeah.

443
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:41,113
Hi. How can I help you?

444
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,955
Take whatever you want.

445
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,583
I have money. I have...

446
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,378
I got a lot of money.

447
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,964
I have...

448
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,683
Please, don't do this.

449
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,478
You don't... You...

450
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:20,152
You... You don't have to do this.
