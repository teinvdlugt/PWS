1
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,915
Sarah.

2
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,793
I'd like you to take this.

3
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,590
Doc,

4
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:18,137
I don't want it.

5
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,430
I wanna be there.

6
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,725
Every part of me needs to be there.

7
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,936
For both of them.

8
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,858
Today I bury my husband.

9
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,486
Next to my only child.

10
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,574
Her grave is still so...

11
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,619
...new. There's only
a little bit of grass on it.

12
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:51,336
Mrs. Palmer, there are things
dark and heinous in this world.

13
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,298
Things too horrible
to tell our children.

14
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,010
Your husband fell victim
to one of these long ago,

15
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,638
when he was innocent and trusting.

16
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,517
Leland did not do these things.
Not the Leland that you knew.

17
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,269
No.

18
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,063
That man I saw.

19
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:15,736
Long, dirty, disgusting hair.

20
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,822
He's gone. Forever.

21
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,495
So is everything I loved.

22
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,749
Sarah.

23
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:34,630
I think it might help to tell you what
happened just before Leland died.

24
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:41,136
It's hard to realize here and here

25
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,181
what has transpired.

26
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:50,020
Your husband went so far as
to drug you to keep his actions secret.

27
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,980
But before he died,

28
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:56,318
Leland confronted the horror
of what he had done to Laura

29
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,322
and agonized over the pain
he had caused you.

30
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,660
Leland died at peace.

31
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:09,957
In his last moments, he saw Laura.

32
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,834
He kept saying
how much he loved her.

33
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:16,004
And I believe she welcomed him,

34
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,632
that she forgave him.

35
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,097
It's time.

36
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,658
Mrs. Palmer, I would be honored
to drive you.

37
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,920
Leland always found
the other earring.

38
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,637
- I don't know about you...
- Excuse me.

39
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:33,392
Get some of this Waldorf salad here.
There we go.

40
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,937
- Nice to see you too.
- Yeah.

41
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,120
I got this for Sarah.

42
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,335
Here you go.

43
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:04,131
- While it's hot.
- Oh, thank you very much.

44
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,757
Mm-hm.

45
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,014
Do they invite people to these things,
or do they just show up?

46
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,227
At a time like this,
people just naturally come together.

47
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,480
It's a time of reaching out.

48
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,483
I remember when my mother died,

49
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,111
there must have been
a hundred people.

50
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,953
Seems like the whole town
is falling apart.

51
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,291
Somehow James thinks it's his fault.

52
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,960
First Laura, then Maddy.

53
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,338
Maybe he blames me, I don't know.

54
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,758
Two people in love couldn't have
caused all this, could they?

55
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,136
Oh, honey.

56
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,055
He'll come back.

57
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,100
Everything's gonna get better.

58
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,942
- Welcome home, Dr. Jacoby.
- Major.

59
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,446
You appear to be fully recovered
from your recent setback.

60
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:14,284
Well, nothing beats the restorative
powers of Hanalei Bay.

61
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,621
- Sheriff, how are you?
- Major.

62
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,581
What's the matter?

63
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,082
Doesn't she feed you?

64
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:28,715
- You're just jealous.
- Jealous?

65
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:34,012
Oh, I... I... I wouldn't... I wouldn't
spend my time changing diapers.

66
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,139
What's next for you, sir?

67
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,767
Well, major, I'm not exactly sure.

68
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,603
I've stockpiled a few weeks
of vacation time.

69
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,481
Now might be the time
to cash them in.

70
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,566
For starters,
would you care to join me

71
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,445
for an incredibly pleasant evening
of night fishing?

72
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,447
Aces.

73
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,199
Eddie,

74
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:59,496
can you see my underpants
in my shoes?

75
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,752
I looked down and I thought
I could see the reflection.

76
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,342
Do you think boys
are looking up my dress?

77
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,721
Sweetheart, I can't see a thing
in your shoes.

78
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,932
I promise.

79
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,351
Okay.

80
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,820
Donna came over to see Laura.

81
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,489
Do you know what they did?

82
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,742
It was late. We'd made popcorn.

83
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:43,290
And they made this very serious
promise to each other,

84
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,001
to be best friends forever.

85
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,046
I... I think it was a kind of bond

86
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,881
against...

87
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,800
Dying.

88
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,557
I need to remember all this.

89
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,186
Besides, she's cursed.

90
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,526
Aah! Oh! Aah! Aah!

91
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,070
Boys, take it easy.
Take it easy. Come on.

92
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,699
I'm gonna stick his head in the gutter
where it belongs.

93
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,496
Dwayne, now knock it off.
Knock it off.

94
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,583
Remember where you are
and why we're here.

95
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,376
Please.

96
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,759
They seem to be having fun.

97
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,889
The mayor and his brother.

98
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,183
Dougie owns the newspaper.

99
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,978
They've had a running feud
going for 50 years.

100
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,480
Nobody knows how it started.

101
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,940
Something about an old flame
and a rumble seat.

102
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,193
I don't even think
they remember anymore.

103
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,737
Well, the nest's a little stirred up
right now.

104
00:10:55,905 --> 00:11:00,033
Dougie's engaged to be married
to a babe.

105
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:06,081
- For the fifth time.
- She's still in her teens, he's 110.

106
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:10,460
One of those January-December
sort of deals.

107
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,130
You remember the first time Dwayne
ran for mayor? When was that?

108
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:19,678
Oh, um... Sixty-two? Yeah, 1962.

109
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,056
Dougie wrote an editorial,
came out against Dwayne.

110
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,350
And Dwayne was
running unopposed.

111
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,356
Harry, I'm really gonna miss
this place.

112
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,202
You're asking me to admit
a 35-year-old woman

113
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,037
to the senior class.

114
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,915
You got me there.

115
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,001
Eddie, how much longer?
Class is starting.

116
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,963
We'll be right out, Nadine.
Just a few more minutes.

117
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,216
Guess what.
Cheerleading tryouts today.

118
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,385
I just saw a notice
on the bulletin board.

119
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,888
That's great, honey. Um...

120
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,058
Why don't you go
practice your splits?

121
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,601
Okay.

122
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,952
Bellman?

123
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,956
Customer relations.

124
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,460
Has everything been satisfactory
during your stay with us, Mr. Cooper?

125
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,087
Audrey, I have no complaints.

126
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,551
- When are you leaving?
- Going fishing.

127
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,012
But you are leaving.

128
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,974
Yes, in effect I am.

129
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:58,151
So this is it? You save my life,
then break my heart?

130
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,280
Audrey, I've explained to you
my personal policy about involving...

131
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,283
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm a teenager.

132
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,619
And you were involved
in a case I was working on.

133
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,755
Someone must have hurt you once
really badly.

134
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,928
No. Someone was hurt by me.

135
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,639
And I will never let that
happen again.

136
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,894
What happened,
did she die or something?

137
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,480
As a matter of fact, she did.

138
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,940
You wanna know how?

139
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,574
She was a material witness
to a federal crime.

140
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,618
We were supposed to protect her.

141
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,954
Twenty-four hours a day.

142
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,706
My partner and I.

143
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,626
Windom Earle was his name.

144
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,921
He taught me everything I know
about being a special agent.

145
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,759
And when the attempt on her life
was finally made,

146
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,262
I wasn't ready.

147
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,764
Because I loved her.

148
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,061
She died in my arms.

149
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,359
I was badly injured,

150
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,695
and my partner lost his mind.

151
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,866
Need to hear any more?

152
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,958
Audrey, I like you
and I care about you.

153
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,460
I'll always consider you my friend.

154
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,382
Friendship is the foundation
of any lasting relationship.

155
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,260
It's nice to be quoted accurately.

156
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,890
Well, let me tell you something,
Agent Cooper.

157
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,017
One of these days,
before you know it,

158
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,561
I'm gonna be grown-up
and on my own,

159
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,730
and you better watch out.

160
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,108
Okay, Audrey. It's a deal.

161
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,031
You know, there's only
one problem with you.

162
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,074
You're perfect.

163
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,719
It's big.

164
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,972
But it is bad.

165
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,605
Leo just got that suit.

166
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,942
Fits him a little tighter.

167
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,863
Yeah, it's a shame to let good threads
go to waste.

168
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,573
What do you think?

169
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,035
Green or yellow?

170
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:59,374
I gotta look good. Ben Horne is a man
who notices these things, you know?

171
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,335
Bobby, honey, you look great.

172
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,714
Can you take me out tonight, please?
I'll get all dressed up.

173
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,468
What about Leo?
We just leave him here? Heh.

174
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,934
I don't know. I'll get a sitter.
I've gotta get out of this house.

175
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,771
Sweetheart, lover, listen to me.

176
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:28,069
If I land this job with Ben Horne,
we're on easy street.

177
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,155
I'll take care of you in ways
you never even dreamed of.

178
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,366
Hang in there,

179
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,662
and let Bobby do his thing.

180
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,666
It's for both of us, okay?

181
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,379
I gotta ramble.

182
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,134
Cross your fingers, cross your toes.
This is the big time. Whoo!

183
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,844
Later.

184
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,158
Hello, Harry.

185
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,871
Forgive my saying so, Catherine...

186
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,123
...but aren't you dead?

187
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,210
Does Pete know?

188
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,630
My husband and I
will be duly reunited.

189
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,843
Well, all things considered,
welcome home.

190
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:38,556
- Any questions?
- Yeah, a couple.

191
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,392
Am I under suspicion?

192
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,561
I guess that depends
on the answers I get.

193
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,522
Maybe you'd like to call your lawyer.

194
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,984
That won't be necessary.

195
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:54,238
- I have nothing to hide.
- Good. Good.

196
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,574
Well, for starters,

197
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,786
where the hell have you been
the past two weeks?

198
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,913
Harry.

199
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,500
Do you believe in guardian angels?

200
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,044
Guardian angels?

201
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,421
Catherine, to tell you the truth,

202
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,883
I'm not so sure what I believe
these days.

203
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:20,598
I believe an angel saved my life.

204
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,727
I was home the night of the fire.

205
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,356
A man called.
The voice, I didn't recognize.

206
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,983
He asked me to meet him
at the drying shed.

207
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:35,488
There was a vague threat implied.
So I went and I took my gun.

208
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,907
And that girl... What's her name?

209
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,868
- Shelly Johnson.
- Johnson. She was there.

210
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,329
She was tied up inside.

211
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,082
I think a bomb went off. I...

212
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:52,296
I have nothing but impressions after
that, just walls of flame, screaming...

213
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:57,927
I have no idea of how I escaped.
But I found myself in the woods.

214
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,598
I was afraid.

215
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,437
I was afraid for the first time
in my life.

216
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,441
I dragged myself through the night.

217
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,237
Then, as the sky lightened,

218
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,198
things began to look familiar.

219
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:24,787
The woods. The path.
A rock formation.

220
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,915
And I was...

221
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,377
...flooded with...

222
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,672
...memories of my childhood.

223
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,760
I thought, "This is what heaven is."

224
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:44,223
And that's when I saw
our old summer cabin in the woods.

225
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:52,481
Heaven was Pearl Lakes.
I'd walked miles through the night.

226
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,485
Only a guardian angel
could have brought me there.

227
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,534
Thank you.

228
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,455
Thank God we always kept
a well-stocked pantry.

229
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:12,168
I went in and I...
I opened a can of tuna fish.

230
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:16,547
And I waited for whoever it was that
was trying to kill me to finish the job.

231
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,259
A loaded gun by my side.

232
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:24,764
I was terrified that every moment
was going to be my last.

233
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,934
What made you come back?

234
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,604
I ran out of tuna fish.

235
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,107
Great news. I quit smoking.

236
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,277
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

237
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,279
I wanted...

238
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:45,243
To be honest, I wanted to talk
about our bambino.

239
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,036
Our bambino?

240
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,915
Lucy, I have been in a ghastly turmoil,
and do you know what I've discovered?

241
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,752
I, Richard Tremayne,
am a terrible, crashing bore.

242
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,006
And what I desperately require
in my life is something...

243
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:05,972
No, someone... more important
than myself to think about, to care for.

244
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:10,059
So perhaps you can see why that,
as a result, I must say,

245
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,729
parenthood is suddenly
so appealing.

246
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,774
- Parenthood?
- Fatherhood, more specifically.

247
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,402
And since I have no skills
in this area...

248
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,946
Nurturing is a relatively
foreign concept.

249
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,155
Shh.

250
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:28,202
- I've enlisted myself in
the Happy Helping Hand program.

251
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,874
Part-time big brother
to some adorable, homeless waif.

252
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,586
Excuse me,
are you the same Dick Tremayne

253
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,965
that works at
Horne's Department Store?

254
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,468
Yes. And, Lucy, I must say,

255
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:49,348
I have absolute confidence
that the child is mine.

256
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,560
Lucy.

257
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:58,858
Lucy, Dick, I have something
I'd like to say.

258
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,653
What is it, Andy?

259
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:08,075
I would like to say that we're all
in a very difficult position.

260
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,329
I come from a large family.
And Mama always said

261
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,581
she couldn't have
fussing and fighting around her

262
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,583
when she had a bun in the oven.

263
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,671
And until we know for sure
who's gonna be throwing that baseball,

264
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,384
or building that dollhouse,
we should all be friends.

265
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,532
So you two go right ahead and talk,
and I'll see you.

266
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,039
Andy, are you crazy?

267
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,750
Hawk, I know Lucy
and I know what'd get her:

268
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,087
Morals and manly behavior.

269
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,048
You think I went too far?

270
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,636
- Harry?
- Hey.

271
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:14,141
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

272
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:18,020
Major Briggs says there's a frying pan
full of steelhead trout out there

273
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,688
with my name on them.

274
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:23,275
That's why I figure
you're gonna be needing this.

275
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,829
Harry...

276
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,876
...this is unbelievable.
- Yeah.

277
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,213
Now, when those steelhead
are running upstream,

278
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:48,217
they're only thinking
about one thing. Sex.

279
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,595
A Green Butt Skunk
breaks their concentration.

280
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,765
A Green Butt Skunk.

281
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,810
Yeah.

282
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,564
Tied it myself.
My dad taught me how.

283
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,191
His dad taught him.

284
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,193
Harry, I don't know what to say.

285
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,280
Oh, one more thing.

286
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,911
I'll recycle this.

287
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,210
Bookhouse Boy patch.

288
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,966
We all agreed.
You're one of us now.

289
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:36,265
Harry, I am honored beyond
my ability to express myself.

290
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,309
You wear that in good health.

291
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:42,438
You ever need us, we'll be there.

292
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,286
Deputy Hawk.

293
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,248
If I'm ever lost, I hope you're
the man they send to find me.

294
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:05,002
May the wind be always at your back.

295
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,214
Deputy Andy.

296
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,550
Your bravery is only exceeded
by the size of your heart.

297
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,511
A rare combination, indeed.

298
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,642
Lucy, my best to you and yours.

299
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,852
Now, you better invite me
to that wedding,

300
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,313
whoever the lucky man might be.

301
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,529
- Sheriff Truman?
- Yeah.

302
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,406
This is Special Agent Roger Hardy
of the FBI.

303
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,325
Roger, what are you doing here?

304
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,786
Dale, we've got a problem.

305
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,372
Effective immediately, without pay,

306
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,960
I regret to inform you
of your suspension from the FBI.

307
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,637
Cooper, I suspect you know
why I'm here.

308
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,764
- I don't.
- Internal Affairs.

309
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,100
We're the agents
who watch the agents.

310
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,894
And his presence refers
to my crossing into Canada.

311
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,273
Hold on, that was directly related
to a case we were investigating.

312
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,441
Not without my knowing
about it, it wasn't.

313
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,819
What's the charge, Roger?
Misfeasance?

314
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,112
"Mis" -what?

315
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,322
The improper and unlawful execution
of an act

316
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,241
that is in itself proper and lawful.

317
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,618
- The rescue of Audrey Horne.
- In part.

318
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:23,956
There's also the disturbing allegation
as to your motives and your methods.

319
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,332
What allegation?

320
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,002
Well, I'm waiting
for some evidence to arrive.

321
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,087
We'll convene in one hour.

322
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,214
Alone.

323
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,095
Come on. Think.

324
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,563
Mr. Horne wasn't expecting you.

325
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:52,610
He said that possibly we could
set something up for you next month.

326
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,696
Could you tell him it's about the tape
he got in the mail yesterday,

327
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,072
and it's urgent?

328
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,117
Could you tell him that, please?

329
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,083
A little late for Halloween, isn't it?

330
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,794
What?

331
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,923
Oh, what are you supposed to be,
a lounge lizard?

332
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,553
Shouldn't you be in school?

333
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,766
School numbs my buns.
What about you?

334
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:27,227
Oh, I'm just trying to get a meeting
with your father.

335
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,106
What on earth do you wanna
talk to him about?

336
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:35,069
A job. Business. It's personal.

337
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,990
Hmm. I didn't know
Daddy dearest was hiring.

338
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,161
Oh, you know me.
I just gotta talk to him first.

339
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,873
Yeah. You're up to something,
Bobby Briggs,

340
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,959
but I'm sure that's
none of my business.

341
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,045
Count to ten.

342
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,926
One,

343
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,469
two,

344
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,429
three,

345
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,515
four,

346
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,809
five...

347
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:14,566
First rule of business
is you have to know who to speak to.

348
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,568
Audrey.

349
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,949
I owe you one.

350
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,458
I know you're a busy man,
I respect that. I'll get right to the point.

351
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,878
Samantha, bring in a fly swatter.

352
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,131
There's a bug in my office.

353
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,761
Hey! You're making
a big mistake. Let me go!

354
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:47,057
Hey, hey, hey! Leave him alone.
He's a friend of mine.

355
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,899
You could tell your boss
that that tape was not the original.

356
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,655
- You okay?
- Yeah.

357
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:06,326
I can't imagine what all this
is about, Bobby Briggs.

358
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,455
You know, that's twice
you saved my bacon, Audrey.

359
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,832
Could be talking sainthood.

360
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,418
Is there anything I can do for you?

361
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,629
How about an ice cream?

362
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:22,634
- Cup or cone?
- Mm. Mm.

363
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:26,430
Cone. I like to lick.

364
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,601
What was the purpose
of your first visit to One-Eyed Jack's?

365
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,104
To gather information about the death
of Laura Palmer from Jacques Renault.

366
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,940
Who you apparently lured
back across the border,

367
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,984
where he was wounded
while being arrested,

368
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,361
and subsequently murdered
that night in the hospital.

369
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,407
Renault was a material witness
to events leading up to Laura's death.

370
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:49,411
Leland Palmer confessed to Jacques'
murder, which I believe he committed.

371
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,538
Am I being held responsible
for this, Roger?

372
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,792
Let's talk about your second visit.

373
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,711
To rescue Audrey Horne
from her kidnappers.

374
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,881
- And both are dead.
- You know procedure.

375
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,467
Crossing the border without contacting
Canadian authorities

376
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,470
is a serious breach
under any circumstances.

377
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,056
I'm not disputing that, Roger.

378
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,184
Is it the Bureau's position
that I'm responsible for these deaths?

379
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,852
That's what we're trying
to determine.

380
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,396
This matter was brought
to our attention

381
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,941
because Mountie King was involved
in a sting operation

382
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,318
to nail this Jean Renault.

383
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,322
We worked six months to set this up.

384
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,407
One night you march in,

385
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:31,370
Renault escapes, two men are dead,

386
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,956
and the cocaine we were using
for the setup

387
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,582
was stolen from the premises.

388
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,044
I don't know anything about
the cocaine, but you've miscounted.

389
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,756
Three people were killed.
Jean Renault killed Blackie,

390
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,384
I didn't know about
the Battis murder until now,

391
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,470
and the bodyguard who turned his gun
on me was killed in self-defense.

392
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,056
So what we have
is crossing jurisdictional borders,

393
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,434
three dead bodies
and international drug trafficking.

394
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,645
I admit to the border crossing.

395
00:30:56,813 --> 00:31:00,607
I told you the extent of my involvement
with the killings.

396
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,359
Roger, I hope you know me better

397
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,404
than to suspect I would have anything
to do with a drug transaction.

398
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,823
I won't know that
until you prove it, Cooper.

399
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,743
And I might add, the DEA's been
brought in to investigate.

400
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:15,247
You have 24 hours
to assemble your defense.

401
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:20,711
In the meantime, I'll require
that you surrender your gun.

402
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,005
And your badge.

403
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,642
Sheriff Truman.

404
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:51,450
Sheriff, please.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

405
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,119
I'll stand.

406
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,831
Well, let me begin by saying

407
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,919
whatever Agent Cooper's guilty of
will not be held against you.

408
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:06,465
And your cooperation will be useful
and greatly appreciated.

409
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:13,096
If I understand the law correctly,

410
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:17,434
you need extradition papers
in order to get a statement from me.

411
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,812
And you need a subpoena
from a judge.

412
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,566
Now, unless you gentlemen
have that paperwork,

413
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,903
I suggest you take
your cooperation...

414
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,488
...and stuff it.

415
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:37,079
That attitude will not serve you
or Agent Cooper.

416
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,332
That's not an attitude.
That's a promise.

417
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,753
Agent Cooper is the finest lawman
I've ever known.

418
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:49,675
I've had nothing but respect for him
since he arrived in Twin Peaks.

419
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,096
Now, I don't know
what information you have

420
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,515
or where you got it from,

421
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,892
but it is dead wrong.

422
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,604
Thank you for your time.

423
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:10,112
Help yourself to a coffee
on the way out.

424
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:21,206
Steeplejacks, Steeplejacks, roll them!

425
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,295
Too short.

426
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:30,382
And Nadine.

427
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,510
Nadine Butler.

428
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:40,684
All right, Nadine. Let's start you off
with a little tumbling.

429
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,237
- Next event, corkscrew.
- My gosh. Did you see her do this?

430
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,989
Hold on. I'm gonna throw you.

431
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,323
Yeah, sure, you are.

432
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,867
Corkscrew!

433
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,966
- Can you believe that?
- No, I don't.

434
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,228
I'm not answering that.

435
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,651
All day and not one word.

436
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,912
Johnson's Nursing Home.

437
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,207
That's great, Bobby.
I'm glad things went so well.

438
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,210
Must have been
the longest meeting in history.

439
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,130
Yeah, I still love you.

440
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,050
Bobby, I've been thinking.

441
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:59,137
We have to do something with Leo.
Put him in a home.

442
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:03,016
It's not worth it.
I don't want the money.

443
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,145
Bobby, I want a life.

444
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,903
He moved.

445
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,531
Bobby...

446
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,908
...Leo moved.

447
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,583
What's with the tablecloths?

448
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:32,212
The critic has spoken.
I feel like a fool.

449
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,800
Norma, pick your lower lip up
off the floor. It wasn't that bad.

450
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,219
Mother, please don't tell me
how to feel.

451
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,681
This business is all I've got.
I wanna keep my regular customers.

452
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,934
I don't care if anyone new
ever comes in here again.

453
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,978
They probably won't.

454
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,481
Not after, "If you want local color,
stop in.

455
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:56,528
But if it's good food you want,
find a wider berth."

456
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,906
It was "local charm," not "color."

457
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:06,580
- You memorized that piece of trash?
- No. I wrote it.

458
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:13,086
You might as well know, so that we
can get this little melodrama over with.

459
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,677
I don't believe it.

460
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,639
Is that why you came to visit,
so you could run me into the ground?

461
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:28,810
No. Darling, I wanted to give you
a good review.

462
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:32,522
This is just not a good restaurant.

463
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,650
I can't violate my professional ethics.

464
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,652
Ethics?

465
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,988
I'm your daughter.

466
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,450
Some standards have to prevail.

467
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:49,372
What about the standards
of common decency and kindness?

468
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,168
Or don't those standards
fit into your profession?

469
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,545
Of course they do.

470
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,798
I wouldn't treat a dog like this,
no less my own daughter.

471
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,092
Oh, as usual you're overreacting.

472
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,594
- Am I?
- Mm-hm.

473
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,931
Maybe I am,

474
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,225
but they're my reactions.

475
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,977
And the hurt I feel is my hurt,

476
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:14,189
and how I react
is none of your damn business.

477
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,735
- Dear, be sensible.
- I'm being very sensible.

478
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,155
I want you out of this place.

479
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,367
I want you out of my life.
I don't wanna be hurt by you anymore.

480
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,370
Norma.

481
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,498
Goodbye.

482
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,292
Go.

483
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,683
Yeah. Yeah.

484
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,522
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

485
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,358
Okay, kids, come on,
we'll take you another time.

486
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,278
- Go on, go.
Whoo, whoo.

487
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:06,157
Whoa. We bagged our limit
and we didn't even fire a shot.

488
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:10,412
- Get off me, man.
- Welcome to the fighter zone.

489
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,205
- I remind you.
- What?

490
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,582
I'm a happily married man.
Recently married.

491
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,294
To an extremely wealthy woman.

492
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:21,715
As we discussed, we're really eager
to do business with you.

493
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,384
Look, I will not steal
my wife's money.

494
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,637
I feel guilty enough about lying to her
about this hunting trip.

495
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,222
- Hey, no harm, no foul.
- Get off.

496
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,267
- She bought it, didn't she?
- I don't know. She doesn't miss much.

497
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,519
And I don't like
this stealing business.

498
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,396
Stealing?
Who said anything about stealing?

499
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,607
- I've had enough of this.
- You're the computer expert, buddy.

500
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,068
Just hit the keys,
and she won't see a ripple.

501
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,778
- Look at it this way.
- Get off.

502
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,156
You don't help us, how long
you think she'll stay your wife?

503
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,325
- I'm getting mad.
- You want me to release you?

504
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,327
Hold it or I'll have to kill you.

505
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,704
You better get with the program, pal.

506
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,831
Get off.

507
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,713
So this is him?

508
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,758
Ernie,

509
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,093
- meet Jean Renault.
- Hi.

510
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,349
I met him one night in the woods,
when he stuck a pistol in my ear.

511
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:16,603
Lucky for me, I had my state
prosecutor's badge with me.

512
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,647
Never leave home without it.

513
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,108
Jean, this is the Professor.

514
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,278
What he can do with numbers would
make a 1000-dollar-a-night hooker

515
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,989
- blush like a nun.
- Ah.

516
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:32,369
Well, a recent investment opportunity
fell through,

517
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,913
leave us in a cash-poor position.

518
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:39,417
We need 125,000 immediately.

519
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,381
I understand completely.

520
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,843
- You do?
- Yeah, this will not be difficult.

521
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,305
Just so you know
a little bit more about me,

522
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,891
I've been associated

523
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,561
with some of the most prestigious
financial institutions in this country.

524
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,523
I've laundered
massive amounts of money.

525
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,192
I've brokered tremendous deals
for the Colombian

526
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,194
and the Bolivian industries.

527
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:10,407
In other words, I'm wired in, okay?
I mean, I'm hardwired.

528
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,910
I'm your man. Definitely.
I'm definitely your man. Yeah.

529
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,331
- Well, you say the magic words.
- Good.

530
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,419
Nicely done, Ernie.
Are you making this up?

531
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,796
No, no.

532
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:32,554
This is the Professor,
our new broker.

533
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,975
Hi.

534
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,197
You can handle a puny little bundle
like this, can't you?

535
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,366
Yes, he can take care of it for us,
can't you?

536
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,827
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

537
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,706
Hank, take the Professor
down to the tables.

538
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,792
I understand you have
a very good system

539
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,878
for the craps and roulette.

540
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,880
Very scientific, eh?

541
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:10,008
I don't gamble anymore.
I used to, but I don't gamble anymore.

542
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,386
- It's a mug's game, you know?
- Mm. Tsk, tsk, tsk. No.

543
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,346
- We all gamble here.
- Ah.

544
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,183
You must enjoy life.

545
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,437
- Yeah, I'll try it. Thank you.
- Yes. Come on.

546
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,939
Come on. Let's go.

547
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,198
I don't like the look of him.
Too nervous.

548
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,575
We'll see, won't we?

549
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:42,665
Four for us, and just a little
to put the last nail in Cooper's coffin.

550
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:49,964
- I'll call you when I'm done.
- Where will you put it?

551
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,384
The car.

552
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:57,889
Won't take much,
just a trace of this.

553
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:03,394
I want him crucified.

554
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,077
- Oh...
- Josie. Josie.

555
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,704
Help me, Harry.

556
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,107
At the time,
I did what I thought was right.

557
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,526
I must now face the consequences.

558
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,570
You can do no more.

559
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:42,285
You know, major,
I find myself thinking a lot about Bob.

560
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,538
If he truly exists.

561
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:49,959
I've pondered that same question
continuously

562
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,962
since this horror was revealed to us.

563
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:58,051
I try to imagine him
out there incarnate,

564
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,097
looking for another victim to inhabit.

565
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:09,395
There are powerful forces of evil.

566
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:16,069
It is some men's fate
to face great darkness.

567
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,572
We each choose how to react.

568
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:23,076
If the choice is fear,

569
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,787
then we become vulnerable
to darkness.

570
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,206
There are ways to resist.

571
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:32,377
You, sir, were blessed
with certain gifts.

572
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,296
In this respect, you're not alone.

573
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:41,094
Have you ever heard
of the White Lodge?

574
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,348
The White Lodge?

575
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,142
No, I don't believe I have.

576
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,656
Major, I'm gonna take
a moment here.

577
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,909
I feel the call of nature.

578
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:09,539
There's nothing quite like urinating
out in the open air.

579
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:13,918
I look forward to hearing more
about this White Lodge.

580
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:20,758
When I return from my journey.

581
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,550
Cooper!

582
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,723
Major Briggs?

583
00:46:10,601 --> 00:47:21,462
Major!
