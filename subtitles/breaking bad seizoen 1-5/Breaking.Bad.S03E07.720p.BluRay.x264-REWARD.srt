1
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:34,909
Why?

2
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,414
Why is this still under discussion?

3
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,670
I don't like him.

4
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,339
I don't care who he knows.

5
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:53,094
We're supposed to trust
him with our products.

6
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,056
Big man.

7
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,891
Big Generalissimo!

8
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,019
Big fry cook is more like it.

9
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,731
The "Chicken Man."

10
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,941
You will do what you want.

11
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,277
But you have my vote.

12
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,454
Never trust a South American.

13
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,123
Dirty, dirty people.

14
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:30,298
He broke my toy! He broke my toy!

15
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,634
He was just having fun.

16
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:36,804
You'll get over it.

17
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,932
No! I hate him! I wish he was dead!

18
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,740
Marco.

19
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:02,580
Grab your old uncle a beer,
would you?

20
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,503
No, no. A cold one.

21
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,222
This is what you wanted.

22
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,099
Your brother dead. Right?

23
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,356
You're going to have to
try harder than that...

24
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,150
...if you want to save him.

25
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,447
How much longer do you think
he has down there?

26
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,827
One minute? Maybe more?
Maybe less?

27
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,846
Family is all.

28
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,321
Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.

29
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,658
All right, you can call my lawyer,
Saul Goodman.

30
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,618
Talk to my lawyer, all right?

31
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,163
You hear me? I got nothing to say.
I told you, you can call my...

32
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Christ!

33
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,296
You got my cell phone number,
my wife's name! How did you do it?

34
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,132
Talk! Who you working with?!

35
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,164
Yes, sir.

36
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,593
If you're ready to talk...

37
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,678
...they wanna get a statement.

38
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,931
Your side of what happened here.

39
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,269
Or we can hold them off
till another time.

40
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,234
Maybe you wanna talk to a lawyer.

41
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,954
There it is.

42
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,625
Yo, Adrian.

43
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,127
Rocky called,
he wants his face back.

44
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,589
Come on, I gotta cheer you up.

45
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,717
You see that?
That's your get-out-of-jail-free card.

46
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,803
You understand
get-out-of-jail-free card?

47
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,098
I mean, just blink once
if you're following.

48
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,102
The DEA's worst nightmare
is that face out in public.

49
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,271
They'll have to steer a wide berth
of young Master Pinkman...

50
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,942
...for fear of the PR poop storm
that will rain down on them...

51
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,946
...if this story ever gets out.
I mean, this beating?

52
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,240
Best thing for you.

53
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,783
You're home free.

54
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,661
Good, right?

55
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,788
Right.

56
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,643
Oh, my God.

57
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:03,190
You're now the cute one of the group.
Paul, meet Ringo. Ringo, Paul.

58
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,696
This is... I...

59
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:15,161
Jesse, I'm... I am so sorry for this.
This should not have happened.

60
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,873
But it did.

61
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,625
No thanks to you.

62
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,673
But the plan did work.

63
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:32,178
We would've been locked up right now
if we didn't lure him away. But this...

64
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,972
This... I just...

65
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,724
I never saw this coming.

66
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,606
So...

67
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,233
What...?

68
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,696
What happens now?

69
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:54,909
I'll tell you what happens now.

70
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:59,538
Your scumbag brother-in-law
is finished.

71
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,540
Done.

72
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,209
You understand?

73
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,588
I will own him when this is over.

74
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,841
Every cent he earns...

75
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,511
...every cent his wife earns...

76
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,056
...is mine.

77
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,433
Anyplace he goes...

78
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,685
...anywhere he turns...

79
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,896
...I'm gonna be there...

80
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,690
...grabbing my share.

81
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:31,779
He'll be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana
for pennies...

82
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,281
...and I'll be standing over him...

83
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,700
...to get my cut.

84
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,245
He'll see me when he wakes up...

85
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:44,291
...and when he crawls to sleep
in whatever rat hole is left for him...

86
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,045
...after I shred his house down.

87
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:52,967
I will haunt his crusty ass...

88
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,885
...forever...

89
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,221
...until the day...

90
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,724
...he sticks a gun up his mouth...

91
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,977
...and pulls the trigger...

92
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,313
...just to get me out of his head.

93
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:13,279
That's what happens next.

94
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,080
My advice:

95
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,500
That's probably
not a good strategy.

96
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,671
They're scared of you right now.
They want nothing to do with you.

97
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,673
But if you hit them...

98
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,592
...they're forced to hit back hard.

99
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,680
I mean, they will turn over every rock
hither, thither and yon...

100
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:43,600
...until someone spills the beans on you
and anyone associated with you...

101
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,352
...present company included.

102
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,522
Yes, I think what Saul is saying
makes a lot of sense.

103
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:53,193
Jesse, move on with your life.

104
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,862
Leave it behind, all of it.

105
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,323
Nothing changes...

106
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,950
...once I walk out of here.

107
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:05,039
I get myself a new RV
and go start cooking again.

108
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,626
How exactly do you think...

109
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,213
...you're going to get away with that?
They will catch you.

110
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,215
- So what?
- What?

111
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,384
I have a get-out-of-jail-free card.

112
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:22,514
Hey, I may have overstated
the power of your face.

113
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,184
Not this.

114
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,562
If the cops catch me...

115
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,858
...I give them
what they want the most.

116
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,864
You.

117
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,913
They nab me...

118
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,332
...I make a deal...

119
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,170
...to give up the great Heisenberg...

120
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:57,591
...and his million-dollar drug ring.

121
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,056
You're my free pass...

122
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,934
...bitch.

123
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,107
You're so sure.

124
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:17,027
Look, if he didn't give up my name
while Hank was beating him...

125
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,779
...he's never going to talk.

126
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,281
What do you think that was, a bluff?

127
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,952
He wants your brother-in-law.
And there's gonna be lawyers...

128
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,413
...creaming their Underoos
for a case like that.

129
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,125
I'd take it myself if it wouldn't
cause so much collateral damage.

130
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,793
And him cooking again?

131
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:37,131
Hey, when, not if, he gets caught,
and he's facing 20 years...

132
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,802
...what'll he do then? Believe me,
there's no honor among thieves.

133
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:45,055
Except for us, of course.

134
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,558
No, he'll...

135
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,768
He'll come around.

136
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,396
And if he doesn't...

137
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,065
...there may come a time
to talk options.

138
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,817
Options?

139
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,251
I'm convinced
Mr. Pinkman was involved...

140
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,754
...in the manufacture and distribution
of phenyl-2 methamphetamine...

141
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,090
...specifically what we call
the blue meth.

142
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,176
I tracked him to a scrap yard...

143
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,845
...where he stored
an early-'80s camper...

144
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,680
...an RV.

145
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,683
While waiting for a warrant
to search this vehicle...

146
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,686
...which I believe to be
a rolling meth lab...

147
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,355
...I received a telephone call...

148
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:40,652
...telling me my wife Marie
had been injured in an accident.

149
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,112
Upon hearing the news...

150
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,533
...I left Mr. Pinkman
and his vehicle to tend to my wife.

151
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,871
Arriving at the hospital, I learned
the emergency call was a hoax.

152
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,458
My wife, fortunately, was unharmed.

153
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:01,465
So I immediately went back to
the salvage yard, but the RV was gone.

154
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,884
Most likely destroyed on site.

155
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,346
And it was at this point you drove
to the home of Jesse Pinkman?

156
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,068
I think we're done here.

157
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,820
Agent Schrader needs to get home...

158
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,030
...get some rest.

159
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,035
That's fine. But just to confirm,
you're taking the Fifth here?

160
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,703
Yeah, that's correct.

161
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,705
Okay. Well...

162
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,375
...we just wanna give you all
a heads up.

163
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,254
Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges
in this matter.

164
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:44,591
He's given a detailed version
of events as he sees them.

165
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,093
The word of a meth head.

166
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,928
We know all about his history.

167
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,598
We're well aware,
but toxicology on Pinkman...

168
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,185
His blood is clean, he's not using.

169
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,438
The kid is even refusing his
doctor-ordered pain meds...

170
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,399
...far as we can tell.

171
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,778
So...

172
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,407
...where do we go from here?

173
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,201
A couple of gentlemen
from OPR will come down...

174
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,245
...probably tomorrow morning.

175
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,581
Janice will give us an exact time.

176
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:20,752
And you men will be continuing
your investigation, so...

177
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,923
- Thanks for your time.
- Right. We just...

178
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,300
We need one more thing.

179
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:31,597
A photo of Agent Schrader's hands.
For the record.

180
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,308
Yes, of course.

181
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,810
Bandage off, if you would.

182
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,568
On the table is fine.

183
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,821
Flat on the table. That's fine.

184
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,048
It's all gonna work out.

185
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,927
You've been too good to them
for too many years.

186
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:39,433
I hope it goes without saying we're not
talking to anybody about this, okay?

187
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,269
Okay.

188
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,939
Marie...

189
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,899
...who?

190
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,477
Hi.

191
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,937
Do you have a minute?

192
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,148
Sure.

193
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,998
I guess crime does pay.

194
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,672
I don't suppose you just came by
to insult me.

195
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,511
No. We need to talk.

196
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,222
You heard about Hank?

197
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,518
About what happened
with this Jesse Pinkman?

198
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,853
Yes, I know.

199
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,356
Whatever Hank was investigating...

200
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:13,443
...him trying to find an RV...

201
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,362
...is there any danger...

202
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,948
...that could lead back to you?

203
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,325
No.

204
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,202
Why would it?

205
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,874
Is this why you're here?

206
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,378
I'm here to talk about Hank.

207
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:38,552
You know what's gonna happen to him
if this Pinkman presses charges?

208
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,390
Hank could lose everything.

209
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,395
I thought maybe...

210
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,774
...there's a way you could help him.

211
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,860
How?

212
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,904
Contact Pinkman.

213
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,156
Get him to drop the charges.

214
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:04,578
I don't know what kind of relationship
you picture me having with this person.

215
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:09,249
- I'm not asking.
- He was... He's... He's not my friend.

216
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,877
- It's not as if we were even close.
- I'm...

217
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,087
I'm not asking.

218
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,882
But there must be something
you could say.

219
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,093
Isn't it even worth a try?

220
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,305
Hank is your family.

221
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,101
Not currently.

222
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,352
What?

223
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,355
I said, not currently.

224
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,902
I'm late. I have to go.

225
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,477
Hello.

226
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,563
I was starting to get worried.

227
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,983
Car trouble.

228
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,903
Oh, that's a bummer.

229
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,740
You should call me next time.
I'll pick you up.

230
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,622
No sandals today?

231
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,999
I just thought...

232
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,670
A bit more professional.

233
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,298
Well, everything is on track.

234
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,970
We got our distillate.
Just waiting to...

235
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,097
Let's get our trays ready.

236
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,683
- Clean, no moisture.
- Done.

237
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,021
Is our?

238
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,440
Our solvent filtered?

239
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,693
I thought you might ask that.

240
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,902
Done.

241
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,533
That's good.

242
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,953
Hand in glove,
that's what we strive for.

243
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:16,209
You know, this might be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

244
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,243
So you the gentlemen?

245
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,584
Lucky you boys caught me,
I got a load to pick up in Memphis.

246
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:02,088
I can hammer it out in about 15,
but there's this girl, Lolly. Maybe Fran.

247
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,591
She's got this fetish,
she likes to get peed on.

248
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,094
I was hoping to see her tonight
but she wants to sleep before 10...

249
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:12,766
...so I wanna wrap it up here ASAP
because traffic can be a wild card.

250
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:17,937
Thing is, women who like to get peed
on tend to be from the warmer climates.

251
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,107
You'd think the ones in colder zones
would be more inclined.

252
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,693
Maybe it's a shock
if the body's not acclimated...

253
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,197
...but, you know, I leave that
for smarter minds than me.

254
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,575
Science is a mystery.

255
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,703
Well, take a gander.
Prices are negotiable.

256
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:37,957
Buying in bulk gets you a discount.
I'm running a special on these honeys.

257
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:43,463
JHPs. Hollow-point bullets,
known as Black Death. Check it out.

258
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,465
Like that?
So sweet, you wanna lick it.

259
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,967
Nickel-plated brass casing,
Lubalox coat.

260
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,471
Sucker has six razor claws
that expand upon impact:

261
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,140
Shred your mama's head
like a cabbage.

262
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,811
Keep it. On the house.
But I been windjamming enough.

263
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,231
Tell me what you're looking for,
what it is you need.

264
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,649
Vests.

265
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,777
Vests? Hell, yeah, we got vests.

266
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,654
Right here.

267
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,994
Sleek, comfortable, thermally bonded,
non-interwoven Kevlar fiber.

268
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,998
Stop a bullet like a soft wang against
a Quaker girl. Ain't getting through.

269
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,836
And lightweight? So lightweight,
you'll forget you're wearing it.

270
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:25,839
They work?

271
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,675
Sure as shit, they do.

272
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,969
I don't leave home without it.

273
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,687
What the hell?

274
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:45,358
You broke my freaking rib,
you maniac son of a bitch.

275
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,391
You're welcome!

276
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,702
Gale.

277
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,663
What temperature did you set here?

278
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,373
Here?

279
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,251
Station five, 75 C.

280
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,256
I said 85.

281
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,591
Eight-five.

282
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,264
I wrote it down. You said 75.

283
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,600
- I wrote it.
- Well, you wrote it wrong.

284
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,435
That's not what I said.

285
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,895
I said 85.

286
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,273
It's always been 85.

287
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,860
Not 75. Not 95.

288
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,237
Eighty-five.

289
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,074
This is chemistry. Degrees matter.

290
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,954
I'm sorry.

291
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,122
I'm very sorry.

292
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,415
Great.

293
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,125
You're sorry, meanwhile...

294
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:30,255
...you've just brewed 50 gallons
of useless sludge. Congratulations.

295
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,799
Just dump it. Dump it all.

296
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,926
This batch is ruined.

297
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,961
You look nice.

298
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,007
I look like a TV weatherman.

299
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,844
You want a coffee?

300
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,265
No.

301
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:27,937
I squeezed some orange juice.
You want a glass of orange juice?

302
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,440
I'm all right.

303
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,866
What are you gonna tell them?

304
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,456
Here's what you'll tell them.

305
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,500
He attacked you.

306
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,213
- He attacked me?
- He swung at you with something.

307
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,383
- Swung at me?
- He attacked you with a pipe.

308
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,218
A pipe.

309
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:05,183
It happened fast. He resisted arrest
and muscle memory kicked in...

310
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,643
...and you had to disarm him.

311
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,562
Muscle memory.

312
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:14,859
Happens all the time. Years of training,
your body acted faster than your brain.

313
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,736
You had no choice but to hit him.

314
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:20,073
- You had to fight back.
- Marie, Marie, Marie.

315
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,700
No.

316
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,828
I'm not gonna go in there and lie.

317
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:30,416
It's some lowlife degenerate
versus you...

318
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,045
...doing the job you're supposed to.

319
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,924
Why should you be the one
who pays...

320
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,926
...for doing the right thing?

321
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:42,804
Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing.

322
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,099
It's not what the job is.

323
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,519
I'm supposed to be better than that.

324
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,773
And you made one mistake.

325
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,111
No, it wasn't one mistake. I've been...

326
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,532
I've been...

327
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,287
...unraveling, you know?

328
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,585
I don't sleep at night anymore.

329
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,964
I freeze.

330
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,091
I freeze up.

331
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:25,346
My chest gets all tight.
I can't breathe.

332
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,099
Just...

333
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,893
I panic.

334
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:36,732
Ever since that Salamanca thing.

335
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:38,943
I mean, Tuco Salamanca.

336
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:43,072
If ever a scumbag deserved a bullet
between the eyes...

337
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,996
It changed me.

338
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,170
And I can't seem to control it.

339
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,925
I tried to fight it.

340
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,138
But then...

341
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,098
...El Paso.

342
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,894
And it's just gotten worse.

343
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,524
What I did to Pinkman...

344
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:24,697
...that's not who I'm supposed to be.
That's not me.

345
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,702
All this...

346
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,539
...everything that's happened, I...

347
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:38,336
I swear to God, Marie,
I think the universe...

348
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,214
...is trying to tell me something...

349
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,549
...and I'm finally...

350
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,719
...ready to listen.

351
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,730
I'm just not the man I thought I was.

352
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,569
I think I'm done as a cop.

353
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:19,835
Now, this is not an easy decision,
but it is one that I have to make.

354
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,712
I'm sorry.

355
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,759
This whole Gale situation, he's...

356
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:29,428
He's just not working out.

357
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,392
Yes, now.

358
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,603
It may sound unorthodox...

359
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:43,609
...but I think our first best option...

360
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,863
...is Jesse Pinkman.

361
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,119
Hello?

362
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:04,964
No, look. There's a shorthand
that exists between us...

363
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,924
...experience together...

364
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:12,638
...at a level that, quite frankly,
I'm just never going to reach with Gale.

365
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,937
Look, Mr. Fring...

366
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:25,985
...when I accepted your offer,
I was told the lab is mine.

367
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,654
And I know best how to run it.

368
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:37,330
Thank you.

369
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,416
Yes, I will. I will.

370
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,044
Okay. Goodbye.

371
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,927
Listen, something's come up.

372
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,307
I think it's a good opportunity.

373
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,854
There's been a job opening.

374
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,564
I need a new lab assistant.

375
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,070
I already did my time.

376
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,864
Why don't you just go get yourself
a monkey?

377
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,950
I don't want a monkey.

378
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,203
I want you.

379
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:19,705
Oh, gee, thanks.

380
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,208
Well, not interested.

381
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,212
I got my own thing going on.

382
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,466
And nice try, saving your asshead
brother-in-law.

383
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,348
That's not why I'm here, Jesse.

384
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,183
There's more.

385
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,396
It's more than an assistant.

386
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,564
Partners.

387
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,734
We'll be partners again.

388
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:52,405
Split everything fifty-fifty,
just like before.

389
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:59,203
One-point-five million dollars each.

390
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,044
No.

391
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:18,013
- I don't think you heard...
- I heard you fine.

392
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,267
I said no.

393
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,564
Let me understand this.

394
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:30,901
You're turning down
one and a half million dollars...

395
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,697
I am not turning down the money.

396
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:38,242
I am turning down you.

397
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,286
You get it?

398
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:44,457
I want nothing to do with you.

399
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,377
Ever since I met you...

400
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:52,923
...everything I've ever cared about...

401
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,217
...is gone.

402
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,929
Ruined, turned to shit...

403
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:04,477
...dead, ever since I hooked up
with the great Heisenberg.

404
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,939
I have never been more alone.

405
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,318
I have nothing!

406
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,570
No one!

407
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,573
All right? It's all gone!

408
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,492
Get it?

409
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,786
No.

410
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,580
No, no. Why...?

411
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:29,001
Why would you get it?

412
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:35,633
What do you even care,
as long as you get what you want?

413
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,092
Right?

414
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,264
You don't give a shit about me.

415
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,769
You said I was no good.

416
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,522
I'm nothing!

417
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,192
Why would you want me, huh?

418
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,823
You said my meth is inferior, right?

419
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:04,620
Right? Hey, you said my cook
was garbage!

420
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,122
Hey, screw you, man!

421
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,667
Screw you.

422
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,550
Your meth is good, Jesse.

423
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,135
As good as mine.

424
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:20,070
Yeah.

425
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,782
Fifty-fifty.

426
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,785
Yes, fifty-fifty.

427
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,956
Okay.

428
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,626
Partners.

429
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,467
Good.

430
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,977
And this is the statement
you want to give?

431
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,479
Yes, sir.

432
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,400
- Hank, you don't have to do this.
- No, I...

433
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,152
I do.

434
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:44,947
I'm good.

435
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:53,038
So we understand
if we write it up like that, you'll sign it.

436
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,001
That's the way it happened.

437
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,962
I accept the consequences.

438
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,886
In the light of these facts...

439
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,432
...as of this moment,
you're suspended without pay.

440
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,394
I have to ask you to hand over
your badge and your gun.

441
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,438
Yes, sir.

442
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,219
Schrader.

443
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,055
Hold up.

444
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,765
Yes, sir?

445
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:55,392
I just wanted to tell you something.

446
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,104
And you didn't hear it from me.
Don't want you to get your hopes up...

447
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:02,941
...but the word in the pipeline is
Pinkman isn't pressing charges.

448
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,905
- Why not?
- Who the hell knows?

449
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:11,408
Maybe you have a guardian angel.

450
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,265
It went fine.

451
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,561
Well, fine means what it means,
yeah.

452
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,772
I'll...

453
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,109
I'll tell you all about it
when I get home, okay?

454
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,445
Yeah. It's...

455
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:50,614
Yeah, it's just...

456
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:52,658
I don't know, baby, I just think...

457
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:55,994
I think we may be okay. Yeah.

458
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:58,580
Okay. I love you too.

459
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,938
- Schrader.
- I need you to listen very carefully.

460
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,190
Two men are coming to kill you.

461
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,775
Come again?

462
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:31,029
They're approaching your car.
You have one minute.

463
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,657
I don't get the gag, jagoff.
Who is this?

464
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,784
They're coming.

465
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:37,828
Hello?

466
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,844
Hey, li...

467
00:41:56,014 --> 00:42:00,893
Gomey, I don't know what that call was,
but it's dumb even by your standards...

468
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,187
...so call me when you get this.

469
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,934
Finish him.

470
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:32,753
Jesus.

471
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,713
No.

472
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:20,300
Too easy.
