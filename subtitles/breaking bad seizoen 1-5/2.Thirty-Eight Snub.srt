1
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:09,634
So how's it look?

2
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,970
Meaning, do l see it?

3
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,348
Yes.

4
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,059
Do you see it?

5
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:25,483
Basically, any lawman
worth his salt is gonna
spot that, yeah.

6
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,486
Assuming that's a deal breaker?

7
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,406
Yes, it's a deal breaker.

8
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:38,121
Well, if stealth
is what you're aspiring to,

9
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,792
you best go with
something more compact.

10
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,711
Thirty-eight Special.

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,920
Snub nose.

12
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,755
Got a concealed hammer

13
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,591
so it don't catch on your belt
when you draw.

14
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,886
Tried and true.
No nonsense about it.

15
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,765
Five shots.
Yeah.

16
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,726
Automatic has how many?

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,145
Ten in the mag,
one in the chamber.

18
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,648
If you can't get it done with five,
you're into spray and pray,

19
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:09,861
in which case, l wouldn't count
on another six closing the deal.

20
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,864
You load that with
1 58-grain hollow points

21
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,993
instead of standard wadcutters,
it's got plenty of stopping power.

22
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,705
Can't get more dependable
than a wheel gun.

23
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,086
Try it on with this.

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,011
That snubbie will conceal up
real nice if you carry it IWB.

25
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,264
Little harder to draw from,
but there's no substitute

26
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,267
if you're intent
on fooling a vigilant eye.

27
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,020
Comes in polymer too.

28
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,731
I prefer the feel of leather.

29
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,400
Old school, I guess.

30
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,861
Well, um...

31
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,655
Sure it's on
the correct side?

32
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,616
If you're right-handed, it is.

33
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,202
I don't know, ma--
Are you sure?

34
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,163
Maybe it'll feel better
on the left side.

35
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,749
General rule,
you don't wanna cross-draw.

36
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,251
Not unless you're gonna be sitting.

37
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:11,047
You know, store clerks,
card gamers and such.

38
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,801
Uh-huh.

39
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:24,143
Either way,
you're gonna wanna
practice your draw. A lot.

40
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,562
Because if you're all fingers,

41
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,233
well, it might could be him
keeping the peace instead of you.

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,026
Catch my drift?

43
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,781
What's this?

44
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,826
That is why you're gonna
pay me five times

45
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,745
what you'd pay
your neighborhood gun store.

46
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,458
Serial number's been filed off.

47
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,505
So to state the obvious,

48
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,591
I don't wanna be caught
with this on me.

49
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,177
No. To state the obvious,
you don't.

50
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:03,891
You know, mister, l've been
providing my services
for the past 30-odd years.

51
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,520
You'd think I'd learn better
than to ask a man his business,

52
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,106
especially not one referred
by the lawyer.

53
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,316
But l do feel the urge
to ask you,

54
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,903
are we strictly talking defense
here?

55
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,907
Yes, absolutely.

56
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,117
Defense.

57
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,785
Why?

58
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,747
Because if it's just
personal protection,

59
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,667
aside from a bucket of money,

60
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,504
you'd save yourself
a potential felony two-spot

61
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:37,967
for carrying a weapon
with a defaced serial number
if you buy it legally.

62
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:44,015
But if you did have to use it,
wouldn't it still be better to use one

63
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,683
that couldn't be traced?

64
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,268
This is the West, boss.

65
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,897
New Mexico's not
a retreat jurisdiction.

66
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,357
Man steps to you bent
on doing you harm,

67
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,528
you got every right to plant
your feet and shoot to kill.

68
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:02,450
Some call it a moral right, and I do
include myself within that class.

69
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,079
All this to say,
I'm happy to take your money.

70
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,583
But if you're not a convicted felon,

71
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,711
you might best be advised
to bear your arms

72
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,589
within the confines of the law.

73
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,305
It's for defense.

74
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,480
Defense.

75
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,990
I'll take it.

76
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,379

Bodacious subwoofers, yo.

Eighteen-inchers, six of them.

Automatically adjusts

158

They're Nazi zombies.

Nazi zombies. Pssh.

160
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,996

Nazi zombies don't wanna
eat you just because
they're craving the protein.

165
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,804

166
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,017
They do it because
they hate Americans, man.

00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,896

Fine.

203
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,134
Can't you sleep?

204
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,597
Actually, yes, Marie.
This is me sleeping.
What's it look like?

205
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,059
It looks like you're looking
at a rock...

206
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,270
at 2:24 in the morning.

207
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:19,816
This is not a rock,
this is a mineral,
for, like, the 1 0th time.

208
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,194
Okay.

209
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,487
Got it.

210
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,739
Blue corundum,
to be precise.

211
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,367
Blue corundum.
Well, it's very pretty.

212
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:32,579
It's encrusted with igneous
biotite in a mica schist.

213
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:36,124
Would you like some more detail?
Because l can give it to you.

214
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,379
You can keep acting
like you give the first shit--

215
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,838
Hank.

216
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,509
Found in the Central Cordillera
of lrian Jaya.

217
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,137
Blue corundum.

218
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,432
I'm just saying...

219
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,811
It's 2 in the morning.

220
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:59,356
I'm just asking if maybe--

221
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:03,652
You know, last I counted,
Marie, there were four
bedrooms in this house.

222
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,244
You know, I mean, if l'm
keeping you awake and all.

223
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,412
- You've reached Walter White.
- Please state your name,

224
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,165
number and reason for your call.
Thank you.

225
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,002
Walt?

226
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,963
Hello? Walt?

227
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,842
Okay, Walt,
could you call me back, please?

228
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,512
Hank's bills are really starting
to pile up here.

229
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,264
And in the meantime,

230
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,726
I haven't received a check from you
in quite a while.

231
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,396
Second order of business
is the car wash.

232
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,608
Unh! God!
So it's time to take the next step here.

233
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,778
We need to look
into buying this car wash while we--

234
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,656
Skyler, what are you doing?

235
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,240
What do you mean?

236
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:37,913
Wait, are you screening all my calls?
No, no, no, I'm just--

237
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,583
What are you thinking leaving
a message like that on my machine?

238
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,460
What are you--?
What did I say?

239
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:48,340
You just left recorded proof
of our intention to buy a car wash.

240
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,259
Now, you think that was wise?
Proof of our what?

241
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,928
What are you talking about?

242
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,556
Skyler, we should not even be
mentioning the words "car wash"

243
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,433
on the phone at all. Period.

244
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,895
Walt, it is a car wash,
not a brothel.

245
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,691
I mean, if we can't even say what it is,
why are we buying it at all?

246
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,235
Ugh, God, look, Skyler,
please, just--

247
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,529
Hey, Mom.
Hey, hon.

248
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,907
Look, there's some cereal
on the breakfast table.

249
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,285
I'm telling you,

250
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,579
if you're not willing
to pull the trigger,

251
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,249
I'm more than happy
to call Goodman myself.

252
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:26,044
No, no, no, I will handle it, okay?

253
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,321
I could so use
a brain transplant right now.

254
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,407
Yeah. I'm going to work.

255
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,286
Wake up, bitch.
Huh!

256
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,498
Damn.

257
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,791
Argh.

258
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,170

Argh. Come on, man.

some breakfast.

Because the way we left things,
I would like the chance
to clear the air.

Hm.

291
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,772
What?

292
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,859
Walter,
you're never gonna see him again.

293
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,583
Oh, look who woke up hungry.

294
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,043
Are you hungry?

295
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,546
Yeah, that's good.
Drink that up.

296
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,382
Just a little longer,
okay, my sweetie?

297
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,259
Okay?

298
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,178
Okay...

299
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,305
There you go.

300
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,766
Okay, now.

301
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:37,397
The Dodge gets a detail,

302
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:42,068
and the Corolla

303
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,030
gets a hand wax.

304
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,365
Right? Hand wax.

305
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,992
Okay.

306
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,369
Ah. Hello. Hello.

307
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,955
Just a few more minutes
then we're on our way home.

308
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,915
Okay, my sweet girl?

309
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,835
Mama's just doing her work here.

310
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,337
Mama's doing her work.

311
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,137
Way to go, Hank.

312
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,765
Come on, way to soldier up.

313
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,394
You're doing it. Come on.

314
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,439
Another few yards.

315
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,274
- Dig.
- Unh!

316
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,820
Argh! Jesus.

317
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,407
Look at you.
Way to go, honey.

318
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,077
Come on.
Come on, Hank.

319
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,537
Keep it going.

320
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,584
Just ten more steps.

321
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,960
Nine.

322
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,254
Eight.

323
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:46,758
Seven.

324
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,095
- Six.
- Six.

325
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,973
You're almost there, Hank.

326
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:03,316
All right, buddy.
That's what I call
kicking some ass.

327
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,694
Oh, that was
awesome, babe. Ha.

328
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,404
Hells, yeah!
Very nice.

329
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,906
Yeah!

330
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,866
Hey!

331
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,206
You're a good man, Chuck.
Thanks.

332
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,333
It's an honor, my friend.

333
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:21,876
Same time tomorrow?

334
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,253
Damned straight,

335
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,296
if l'm still alive.

336
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,384
- Great session.
- Lots of positive energy.

337
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,302
Lots.

338
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,806
It's just--
It's so great to see that.

339
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,350
It's just...

340
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,768
Yeah.

341
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,312
One day at a time.

342
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,939
All we can do.

343
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,233
I know. It's just...

344
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,193
You've got a real way with him.

345
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,195
It's...

Heh. I'll see you tomorrow.

00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,255
Wow, you were
so strong today.

349
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,924
Did you work up an appetite?
I'm sure you did.

about cooking tonight, so--

- Oh, my God.

Yo, what's up with the pie, man?
It ain't cut.

356
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,549
Yeah, right. That's the gimmick.
What gimmick?

357
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:55,511
This place, they don't cut their pizza,
they pass the savings on to you.

358
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,805
How much can it be
to cut a damn pizza?

359
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,974
Maybe it's, like, democratic, bro.

360
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:03,478
You know,
cut your own Christmas tree,
cut your own pizza.

361
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,146
Yeah, it's democratic.

362
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,524
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Don't sweat it.

363
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,027
You got some, like, scissors?

364
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,904
I will cut this bitch up good.

Gotta figure, you make, like,
1 0 million pizzas a year.

368
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:26,542
Each pizza takes, like,
1 0 seconds to cut.

In man-hours, that's...

There's just one thing
you and me gotta talk about.

No.

to do with this?

Mr. Wolynetz,
my name is Skyler White.

433
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,822
How do you do?

434
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:01,330
You wanna buy my car wash?
I do.

435
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:05,251
And I am prepared to talk numbers
right now, if you'd like.

436
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,837
You think this is an easy job?

437
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,549
You are willing to get down
on your hands and knees

438
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,552
and scrub like a housemaid,

439
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,013
with all the chemicals
eating into your nice skin

440
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,765
and stinging in your eyes?

441
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,561
Well, I know a thing or two
about scrubbing.

442
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:27,106
Any other advice for me?
Because l am serious about this.

443
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,566
Good.

444
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,901
I am serious too.

445
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:35,156
I have worked 30 years on building
this business from nothing,

446
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,492
with my own hands
and my own sweat and blood.

447
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,745
I can appreciate that. Truly.

448
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,080
So with that in mind,

449
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,791
is there a figure
you can quote me?

450
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,626
One which you think would--

451
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,962
Ten million dollars.

452
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:01,056
Well, let's try 879,000.

453
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:05,019
Where do you come up
with this number?
You pull it from your behind?

454
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:13,152
On a typical day,
you average 1 9 cars per hour.

455
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,406
Extrapolating, l added
the extra revenues for
hand waxes and detailing.

456
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,617
Subtracted your overhead
in salary,

457
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,369
maintenance,
operating fees, depreciation,

458
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,790
which I obtained from businesses
in the Albuquerque area,

459
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,376
giving me an estimate
of your annual cash flow here.

460
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:34,673
I applied industry-standard multiplier,
added market value of your real estate.

461
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:39,553
Giving me a total
estimated value of $829,000.

462
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:45,267
On top of which I generously
added an extra $50,000.

463
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,312
So as not to be insulting.

464
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,482
Twenty million dollars.

465
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,944
Okay, Mr. Wolynetz, this--

466
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,738
This is the price for Walter White.

467
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,573
Ah.

468
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,910
Oh, yes. You don't think
I know who you are?

469
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,245
I remember.

470
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,915
Well, I have not pretended to be a--
Your husband,

471
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,584
he quit without giving me notice.

472
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:15,548
He broke my air fresheners,
he cursed at me and grabbed himself.

473
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,925
And now he wants
to buy my car wash.

474
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:21,512
But he's not man enough
to come in here and face me himself.

475
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,848
Instead he sends his woman.
Excuse me.

476
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,684
Walter White wants
to buy my car wash.

477
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:30,896
The price he pays
is 20 million dollars.

478
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,106
Now, please leave.

479
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:51,166
Have you recently lost a loved one
in an aviation disaster?

480
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,587
Have you suffered injury,
shock to the senses

481
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:58,048
or property damage
as a result of airplane debris

482
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,634
or, God forbid, falling body parts?

483
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,386
Then call me, Saul Goodman.

484
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,098
It goes without saying,
that the six, seven,

485
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,393
perhaps eight-figure cash settlement
that l can win for you

486
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,439
will never fill the hole in your heart
caused by your tragic loss.

487
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:16,191
But you deserve justice.

488
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,361
So if you want to tip the scales
back in your favor,

489
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:20,946
better call Saul.

490
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,949
- Saul Goodman, attorney-at-law.
505-503-4455.

491
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,704
We are just about ready to go...

492
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,020
You might wanna learn
how to tail better

493
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,106
if you're planning
on making a habit of it.

494
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,861
May I buy you a drink?

495
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,907
Next round, when you're done.

496
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,453
Why not? You make
a hell of a lot more than l do.

497
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,712
Another round for him,
and I'll have the same.

498
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,422
No ice.

499
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:32,518
I feel like I need
to explain myself.

500
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,939
There were some actions
that I took which I want you
to understand.

501
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,111
I didn't want any of this
to happen.

502
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,617
Everything l did,
I did out of loyalty to my partner.

503
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,328
And then, later,

504
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,330
of course,

505
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:56,166
purely out of self-defense.

506
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,794
I hope you can appreciate that.

507
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,131
Just like I appreciated that...

508
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:10,514
I appreciate that when
you were going to kill me,

509
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:14,935
you were simply following orders.
I get that. Completely.

510
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,062
And I harbor no ill will.

511
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,275
Well, there's a load
off my mind.

512
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,696
Mike, I'm trying to tell you--
I get it.

513
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,156
Fine.

514
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,450
Drink up, Walter.

515
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:45,424
Hell of a last couple of weeks.

516
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,888
Makes a man wonder exactly
where he stands.

517
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:05,194
I mean, I cannot be alone
in feeling this way.

518
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,988
Not after what happened to Victor.

519
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:16,163
So, what's with the piece?

520
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,750
Right hip,
inside your waistband.

521
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:24,922
I noticed it the other day
at the lab. You wear it
if it makes you feel better.

522
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,258
But if push comes to shove,
it's not gonna help.

523
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,595
Mike, do I have to come right out
and say this?

524
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,640
You and I...

525
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,391
we're in the same boat.

526
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,810
Drink your drink.

527
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,063
If it happened to Victor,
it could happen to you.

528
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,899
And what the hell was that,
anyway? Hm?

529
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,734
A message?

530
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:49,029
He cuts a man's throat
just to send a message?

531
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,281
You won, Walter.

532
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,867
You got the job.

533
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:58,956
Do yourself a favor
and learn to take yes for an answer.

534
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,458
Yeah, I got the job.

535
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,210
But for how long?

536
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,968
Get me in a room with him.

537
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,764
Mike, just get me in a room,

538
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,475
and I'll do the rest.

539
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,109
You done?

540
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,073
Yeah.

541
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,496
Whoa.

542
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,651

547
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:36,220
Jesse, l've been awake
for, like, three straight days.

548
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,263
I'm turning into a Sleestak.

549
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,723
So crash here.

550
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,934
It's not like I ain't got
the space.

551
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:46,313
Yeah, that's cool and all,
but l think I got, like, this cat.

552
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:50,317

supposed to feed it.

553
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,861
Whatever, you little bitch.
What about you?

554

or do I gotta flip you over,
check you for a slizz?

555

Bro, l'm kind of
pushing flowers here, yo.

556
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,329
I ain't proud of it,
but it's God's honest truth.

Hell, brother, you know
we got mad love for you.

558

Now that you're back
in the mix, it's, like,
nothing but good days ahead.

559
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:16,218
Plenty of time to pace it out,
is all l'm saying.
