2
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,713
How's it coming?

3
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,091
Very, very well.

4
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,261
It's a flurry of deliveries.

5
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,305
Feels like Christmas morning.

6
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,183
Ahh, it's exciting.

7
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,979
It's really coming together.
And I'd like to point out

8
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:05,940
that if you have
any understandable questions

9
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,151
about the price tag...

10
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,780
That sound? Quality.

11
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:17,535
At Pfizer, at Merck,
that unit would be right at home.

12
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,245
That goes for all of it.

13
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,833
Good. l want you
to have what you need.

14
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,752
Oh. Well,

15
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,713
I doff my proverbial cap
to you, sir. Ha-ha.

16
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,132
When do you think
we'll be up and running?

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,633
Within a month, l'd say.

18
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,511
Two weeks.

19
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:40,725
Or, yeah, two weeks.

20
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,852
Good. Very good.

21
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,606
By the way, that sample
you asked me to run?

22
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:52,653
I ran it, and it is quite good.
Thank you very much, Gale.

23
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,782
You can give that to Victor to discard.
Uh, sure.

24
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,493
Is that our competition?

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,370
I'm sorry?
The, uh...

26
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,623
It really is quite good.

27
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:08,085
The purity, of course, l'm speaking of,
speaking strictly in chemical terms.

28
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,548
And I can't, as of yet,
account for the blue color,

29
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,135
but if that is our competition,

30
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,639
we have our work cut out for us,
so to speak.

31
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:23,768
You don't have any competition, Gale,
not as far as l'm concerned.

32
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:27,522
After all, how pure can pure be?

33
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:32,026
Well, it can be pretty darn pure.

34
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:38,366
Mr. Fring, I can guarantee you
a purity of 96 percent.

35
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:42,495
I'm proud of that figure.
It's a hard-earned figure, 96.

36
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:46,082
However,
this other product is 99.

37
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,544
Maybe even
a touch beyond that.

38
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,005
I'd need an instrument
called a gas chromatograph

39
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,549
to say for sure,

40
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,927
but, um, that last 3 percent,

41
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:02,306
it may not sound like a lot,
but it is.

42
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,475
It's tremendous.

43
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:08,479
It's a tremendous gulf.

44
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:14,318
Gale, for our purposes,
96 percent will do just fine.

45
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,572
Please, don't let this trouble you.

46
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,200
Yeah. It's just...

47
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:26,038
I'd love to know
who synthesized it, is all.

48
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,835
A man who wants to work with me.

49
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,045
A trained chemist, like yourself.

50
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,631
But it won't happen.

51
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,134
I don't consider him a professional.

52
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:44,181
If he's not, I don't know
what that makes me.

53
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,351
I'm not trying
to talk myself out of a job--

54
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,938
With this person,
there are other considerations.

55
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,776
His is the best l've ever seen,
hands down.

56
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,948
And I look at this place
that you've built,

57
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,409
the money you're investing,

58
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,995
sparing no expense.

59
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,456
And I know...

60
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,795
I know that
you want the best.

61
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,940
6353 Juan Tabo. Apartment 6.

62
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,818
No, no. Eubank's west.

63
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,697
It's between Eubank and Spain,
but Mazatlan's closest.

64
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:28,035
I don't know. I just heard the one,
like, you know, a backfire,
a truck backfiring.

65
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,789
I came out of my apartment.
A couple came out.

66
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,749
No. No, nobody saw.

67
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,419
Did you guys see anybody?

68
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,922
Guys, did you--? l don't know
if they speak English too good.

69
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,258
I don't think they saw anybody.

70
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:46,095
It was just this one loud--
This very loud pop and that was all.

71
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,848
No arguing or like that.

72
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:53,477
So you guys good in directions there?
You want me to..?

73
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,023
They coming east or west?

74
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,777
If heading east, tell them there's
an Exxon on their left-hand side.

75
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:06,866
Then it's straight residential.
You want me to what? Yeah.
No. I'll stay on the line.

76
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,914
You know him?

77
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,624
We all heard this shot.

78
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,668
I don't think
you ought to go in there.

79
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:21,338
Mister, this is a crime scene.
You don't wanna touch anything.

80
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,174
Mister?

81
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,678
Mister, are you listening to me?

82
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,281
Little bastard.

83
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,245
Drive.

84
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,217
What the hell happened?

85
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,595
He's gone?

86
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,931
Look at me.

87
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,808
Gone?

88
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,602
You sure?

89
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,146
Gone. Splattered all over.

90
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:47,151
Oh, Jesus. Jesus. Oh, shit.

91
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,572
All right.

92
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,908
So...

93
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,492
Shit.

94
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:00,039
- All right, you do a sweep?
- Couldn't. People there.

95
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,211
People? He get himself
seen by these people?

96
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:11,091
What about you?

97
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,552
Yeah. So what?

98
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,473
Just another looky-loo.

99
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,695
I guess l'd better get this over with.

100
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,809
Hey.

101
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,937
Oh, jeez, I woke you up.
I woke you up.

102
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,065
No, no, no, it's okay.
I needed to get up anyway.

103
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,775
Are you coming in?

104
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,403
No. It's kind of my only time
to run errands.

105
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,029
I just needed to...
Ah.

106
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,534
I...

107
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,495
Sorry.

108
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,913
It's okay.

109
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:28,002
And thank you, bigtime,
as always.

110
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,381
They seem to be getting bigger
instead of smaller.

111
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,759
Not really sure
what that's all about.

112
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,387
Please, for God's sake,

113
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,432
tell me if this is getting
to be too much for you.

114
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,184
Absolutely not, okay?
It's absolutely fine.

115
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,145
Okay.

116
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,943
Does this mean
what I think it means? Heh.

117
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,114
What?
You and Walt?

118
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,450
What?

119
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,578
His car is in the driveway.
It's not a state secret.

120
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:06,999
I-- Oh. All right. Okay.
I'm not pressing. I just...

121
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,335
I think that it's great.

122
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,420
That's all, all right?

123
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,088
I'm out of here.
Okay.

124
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:18,510
Oh, hey. A big howdy-do
to Mr. l'm-Not-Here.

125
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,749
in Albuquerque today.

126
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,461
But you know what? It always is when
you have 330 days of sunshine a year.

127
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,307
On morning commute,
northbound 25,

128
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,352
we've got a two-car accident
on the right shoulder.

129
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,397
You gotta be careful.
Also, from the west side,

130
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:57,359
we've got another accident,
Paseo del Norte and Second Street.

131
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,404
That one's on the left shoulder,
so be on the lookout.

132
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,949
That's a look at your
morning commute on Coyote 1 02.5.

133
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,869
Oh, hey.

134
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,704
Breakfast?

135
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,415
Yeah.
Yeah? Okay.

136
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,340
All right. What you want?

137
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,199
All right, look.

138
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,661
So I make it 1 0 to 9,
which means--

139
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,914
Shut up.

140
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:40,128
Which means we need to start
a cook in the next 1 0 minutes

141
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,838
to keep to our schedule.

142
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,675
Gus' schedule.

143
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,596
And as angry as he may be,
I don't believe he's willing

144
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,431
to forfeit an entire batch.

145
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,393
That just might make him angrier.

146
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,107
Come on, Mike. Let us cook.

147
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,110
Isn't that
what this whole thing is about?

148
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,975
That's right, genius.
Watch me.

149
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,895
We ain't missing no cook.

150
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,838
We're closed.

151
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,257
Closed.

152
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,924
Saul Goodman
and Associates.

153
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,927
I'll see if he's in.
Please hold.

154
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,974
Saul, Skyler White calling.

155
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,353
Saul.

156
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,995
Saul, Skyler White on the line.

157
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,165
Saul.
Hey.

158
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,459
Skyler White.

159
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,420
What the hell does she want?

160
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,137
He's nowhere to be found.

161
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,514
I called his condo,
every number l have.

162
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,183
Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.

163
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,185
You're sure?

164
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,729
As in, you know where he is?

165
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:30,484
Heh, heh. I'm not the man's keeper,
but Walt's a big boy. He'll turn up.

166
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,527
Mr. Goodman,
something is going on.

167
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,363
Why would he leave his car
in my driveway?

168
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,867
People carpool to work, right?
It's good for the environment.

169
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:42,579
He carpools?
He carpools to his job at a meth lab?

170
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,415
Hey, whoa. Oh-ho,
you're breaking up there.

171
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,293
I didn't quite catch that last...
Whew!

172
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,797
You're a Chatty Cathy today.
Okay, do you know anything?

173
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,425
Anything at all? Please,
I'm looking for some help here.

174
00:18:55,593 --> 00:19:00,972
Look, Walter is fine, okay?
I guarantee that, hundred percent.

175
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,183
One hundred percent.

176
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,149
You got a passport, right?

177
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,360
Yeah. Albuquerque.

178
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,737
I'm in Nob Hill.

179
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,740
I need the number
for a locksmith.

180
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,118
I don't know. Pick one.

181
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:07,664
You sure there's nothing?
No, it's not even me. lt's state law.

182
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,750
Are you sure there isn't
some sort of--? I don't know.

183
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,669
No. Nothing.

184
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,172
Maybe a car registration.
That would have your address.

185
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,176
No, but l can't even get in my car.
My car keys were on the same ring.

186
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,264
My God, my credit cards, my--
It's all right, sweetheart.

187
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:28,143
My driver's license, my checkbook.
I have to start canceling all that.

188
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:32,564
My whole life was in that purse
and he just cut it right
off my shoulder.

189
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,399
We could've been stabbed.

190
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,778
I'm sorry, really.
But without proof of residency...

191
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,697
I can take you down to my shop.

192
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,283
You're welcome to wait,
file a police report.

193
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,786
I can't believe this.
I cannot believe this day.

194
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,706
I know. It's just, it's the law.

195
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,501
Oh, my God. My medication.
I bet it's gone.

196
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:00,342
Oh, God, not now, not this.
Gotta call the pharmacy.

197
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,177
Are you okay?

198
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:06,473
Please, just-- Please, just take her.
Please. Just take her, please.

199
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,893
Oh. Oh, God.

200
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:14,147
Not now. No. Not now.

201
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,115
Oh, you're a lifesaver. Truly.

202
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,410
Here you go, sweetheart.
Oh, there you go.

203
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,501
Um-- How do you--?
How do you wanna deal with the bill?

204
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:39,005
I-- Unfortunately,
all my cash was taken so...

205
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,049
That's fine. We'll mail it to you.

206
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,635
Will you? You know
where l live, right?

207
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:48,181
Sir, again, thank you so much. Really.
Yeah.

208
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,875
Hey there. l'm back.

209
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,549
How was PT?

210
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:52,263
I heard it was very good.

211
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,810
Mm.
I'm really liking this new therapist.

212
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,772
He keeps me in the loop,
always has time
for a phone call. It's...

213
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,649
I like it.

214
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,068
So?

215
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,904
Tell me all about it.

216
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,116
I heard you broke
new ground today.

217
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,160
I broke new ground?

218
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,372
That's what he said. Tell me.

219
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,504
I walked 1 6 feet in 20 minutes,

220
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:28,216
which is up from
my 1 5 and a half yesterday.

221
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,385
And this much less shit
in my pants.

222
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:35,056
So, yeah, Marie, if you and him and
everybody in America took a vote,

223
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,892
changed the meaning
of the English language,

224
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,271
yeah, I guess
I "broke new ground."

225
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,150
Well, call it a figure of speech,

226
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,529
but l am seeing progress.

227
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,617
Definite progress.

228
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,496
You're ordering a new rock?

229
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,541
I'm bidding on a new mineral.

230
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,086
It's a nice one.

231
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,467
What? lt's pretty.

232
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,636
I need the thing.

233
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:19,142
Okay, numero uno.
Dos.

234
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:30,028
Okay.

235
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:59,015
It has all those pretty
little crystals. l like that.

236
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,977
Okay.

237
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:29,921
All right, I just wanna go on record,
we should all be wearing masks.

238
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,138
We should be wearing masks.

239
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,407
Bet he forgets the aluminum.

240
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,037
Guaranteed.

241
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,540
Guarantee he forgets.

242
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:14,215
Mm-hm. Oh, you don't know
what the hell you're doing, do you?

243
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,426
You forgot the aluminum.

244
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,265
One of the first steps in the...

245
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,565
Son of a bitch.

246
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,843
All right,
let's talk about Gale Boetticher.

247
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,470
He was a good man
and a good chemist,

248
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,556
and I cared about him.

249
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:30,810
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

250
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,771
He didn't deserve it at all.

251
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:42,113
But l'd shoot him again
tomorrow and the next day
and the day after that.

252
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:46,993
When you make it Gale versus me,
or Gale versus Jesse,

253
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:50,538
Gale loses, simple as that.

254
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:58,296
This is on you, Gus.
Not me, not Jesse.

255
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,257
Gale's death is on you.

256
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,803
I mean, really,
what did you expect me to do,

257
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:10,308
just simply roll over
and allow you to murder us?

258
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:15,062
That I wouldn't take measures,
extreme measures to defend myself?

259
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,272
Wrong.

260
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:22,737
Think again. And whatever it is
you're planning there,

261
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:26,449
whatever it is, the point
that you're trying to make here,

262
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:30,077
let me suggest
that you keep one thing in mind.

263
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:34,624
Without us,
without Jesse and myself,

264
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,794
you have no one
to make your product.

265
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,964
Certainly not him.

266
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,801
This person doesn't know
what the hell he's doing.

267
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:49,847
Been watching him for weeks.
I know every step of his cook.

268
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,016
Oh.

269
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:55,144
Do you really? You?

270
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:03,861
Really?
Oh, so please tell me.

271
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:09,033
Catalytic hydrogenation,
is it protic or aprotic?
Because l forget.

272
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:14,330
If our reduction isn't stereospecific,
how can our product be pure?

273
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:18,960
I mean, is 1-phenyl-1-hydroxy-
2-methylamino-propane,

274
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,462
containing, of course,
chiral centers

275
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,549
at carbons number one and two
on the propane chain?

276
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,884
Then reduction
to methamphetamine

277
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,555
eliminates which chiral center
is it again?

278
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,848
Because l forgot.

279
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:36,477
Come on, help me out, professor.

280
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,312
Gus.

281
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,483
We're here. Come on.
Let us work.

282
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,320
All his bullshit aside,
it's called a cook.

283
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,948
Everything comes down
to following a recipe.

284
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,617
Simple, complicated,
it doesn't matter.

285
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,245
The steps never change,

286
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,539
and I know every step.

287
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:59,417
Oh, is that what you want?

288
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:05,089
This short-order cook?
You're not flipping hamburgers.

289
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,967
What happens when
you get a bad barrel of precursor?

290
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:09,677
How would you
even know it?

291
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:13,973
And what happens in the summer
when the humidity rises

292
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,809
and your product goes cloudy?

293
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,605
How would you
guard against that, huh?

294
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,189
Gus.

295
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:27,153
You do this, all you'll have left

296
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:30,615
is an $8 million hole in the ground.

297
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,617
This lab,

298
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,286
this equipment is useless
without us.

299
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,707
Without Jesse and myself,
you have no new product.

300
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,917
You have no income.

301
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:46,297
Your people out there will not be paid.
Your distribution chain collapses.

302
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,507
Without us,

303
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,968
you have nothing.

304
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:55,640
You kill me, you have nothing.

305
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,976
You kill Jesse,
you don't have me.

306
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,201
You won't do this.

307
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,496
You're too smart.

308
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,248
You can't afford to do this.

309
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,251
Please.

310
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,714
Let us just go back to work.

311
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,591
We're here.

312
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:35,012
Let us work.
We're ready to go to work.

313
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,099
We'll just pick up
right where we left off.

314
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,146
Well?

315
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,150
Get back to work.

316
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:17,086
Listen,
we'll just lay this down.

317
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,380
Put him in feet first.

318
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,548
Grab his shoe.

319
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:26,053
Here. Wait, wait, wait.
Just lift him up. There. All right.

320
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,976
Oh, God.

321
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,603
You push that way,
I'll hold him in.

322
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,358
Okay, ready? One...

323
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,860
Oh, shit.

324
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:45,322
Wait, wait. Wait.

325
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,534
Forget that. Okay.

326
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,671
Come on. Up.

327
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,344
Get down.

328
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,514
Okay, okay.

329
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:27,865
I never use this stuff.
Are you sure it'll do the job?

330
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,284

00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,152
What next move?

351
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,029
Our next move.

352
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:18,493
Our next move, given the fact
that at the first opportunity,
Gus will kill us.

353
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,747
What, that wasn't
an opportunity just now?

354
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,291
Seemed like a damn good
opportunity to me.

355
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,752
No, no.
Golden, I would say.

356
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,547
We bought ourselves some time,
yes, but...

357
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:35,510
The question is how much.
He'll be looking for another chemist.

358
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,513
He's not gonna find another chemist.
Hm.

359
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,225
Where is he gonna find
another chemist?

360
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:45,437
It's not just about somebody
being able to run a lab that big.

361
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,064
Someone he can trust,

362
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:51,109
someone he knows
will keep their mouths shut.

363
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,863
Yeah. Good luck with that.

364
00:42:56,407 --> 00:43:00,077
Bet it took him years to find Gale.

365
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,829
Heh. Bet he's sorry now.

366
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:15,425
Are you sure you're okay?
Now we all understand each other.

367
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,219
Right?

368
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:22,891
What do you mean?
I mean, him and us, we get it.

369
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,609
We're all on the same page.

370
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,323
And what page is that?

371
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,784
The one that says:

372
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,245
"lf I can't kill you,

373
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,206
you'll sure as shit wish
you were dead."

374
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,095
Yo, excuse me.

375
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,598
Thanks.

376
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,197
- Here.
- Thank you, sir.

377
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,490
Have a good one.

378
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,326
Thanks.

379
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:47,309
Hi.

380
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,021
Um, it's parked
over on Amsden.

381
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:54,316
Junior was about to get up
and he would've seen it,

382
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:57,527
so I wanted to avoid
a lot of questions.

383
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,155
Smart.

384
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,824
Well.

385
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,702
Kenny Rogers.

386
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:09,748
Yeah.

387
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,877
You okay?

388
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,671
Yeah.

389
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,508
Right as rain.

390
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,225
Do you have your keys?

391
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:29,810
Yeah.

392
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:34,523
Um... It's parked three blocks
down on the right.

393
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,443
Yeah.
