1
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,137
Cooper.

2
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:54,113
I remember stepping from the flames,
a vague shape in the dark,

3
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,323
then nothing.

4
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:01,078
Until I found myself standing
by the cold remains of our campfire

5
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,663
two days later.

6
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,124
Major, there are
some new techniques

7
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,335
that might help us break through
your amnesia.

8
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:12,131
My memories are immune
from regression.

9
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:18,762
I can feel them, they are palpable,
the smells and the sensation.

10
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:23,767
Everything is known to me,
yet somehow beyond my reach.

11
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,061
Do you remember anything else?

12
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,646
Very little.

13
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:33,068
Save for one disturbing image
of a giant owl.

14
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,611
- Pervasive.
- A giant owl?

15
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,954
A giant owl? How big?

16
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,749
Enough to cloud my mind
and memory.

17
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:53,297
Three triangular scars behind
the right ear in perfect proportion.

18
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,132
Major Briggs,

19
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,678
exactly what does
your work involve?

20
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,431
That information's,

21
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:06,393
as I've repeated endlessly
to myself,

22
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,812
classified.

23
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:16,945
Though the keeping of secrets
seems less meaningful to me now.

24
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:27,372
Perhaps there are sources
of information that are so important

25
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,543
as to transcend the human need
to conspire.

26
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,797
Information of such weight,
that pertains not...

27
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,136
Oh, God.

28
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,140
Is this meant for the soul?

29
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,060
My soul?

30
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,276
Major, perhaps you'd better
start back at the beginning.

31
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,949
Are you familiar
with Project Blue Book?

32
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,409
Yes, sir, I am.

33
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,703
The Air Force investigation
into the phenomena

34
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,039
of unidentified flying objects.

35
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,084
Officially disbanded in 1969.

36
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,672
But there are those of us

37
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,676
who continue,
in an unofficial capacity,

38
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,263
examining the heavens as before.

39
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,891
In the case of Twin Peaks,
the earth below.

40
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,147
We are searching for a place
called the White Lodge.

41
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,487
- Major Briggs?
- I've been expecting you.

42
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,782
- Hold on just a minute, fellows.
- Colonel Riley's orders.

43
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,701
I don't care what orders you've got,

44
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,412
this is my station and Major Briggs
happens to be a friend of...

45
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,122
Harry.

46
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,670
I'm afraid we will have to continue
this discussion at a later date.

47
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,797
Are you sure
you wanna go with them?

48
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,465
Yeah.

49
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,302
- Goodbye.
- Major.

50
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,757
Oh, go ahead, Ernie, it won't bite.

51
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,467
A lot you know, pal.

52
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,261
These men are dangerous thugs,

53
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,348
not that I haven't met
plenty of their kind before.

54
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,849
Jean Renault is a hard man,

55
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,976
but I've known men
that would make him quiver.

56
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,519
Ernie, come on.

57
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,355
Make the call.

58
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,483
Well, have we set the buy yet?

59
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,153
Trying to.
Ernie's a wee bit gun-shy.

60
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,780
Gun-shy?

61
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,741
Ernie Niles is as bold as can be.
Let me at him.

62
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,916
Please, don't make me do this.

63
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,418
This is suicide, I know.
Please, I'm begging you, please.

64
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,128
For everybody's sake, please.

65
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,048
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie.

66
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,845
Hello.

67
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,724
May I speak to Jean Renault,
please?

68
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,898
Hi, Jean. Yeah, I've got
that big out-of-town buy here.

69
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,862
Hi, Lucy.

70
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,656
Oh.

71
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,417
Where have you been, Andrew?

72
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,961
There was a cat in a tree.

73
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,213
A peace officer's work
is never done.

74
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:07,175
But fortunately for us, my efforts
have borne more palatable fruit.

75
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,554
I paid the Happy Helping Hand
adoption agency a visit,

76
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,557
where several blue-haired ladies
were only too happy to sup

77
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,475
from my open palm.

78
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,812
Unfortunately,
little Nicky's records have been sealed

79
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,605
and returned to the orphanage.

80
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,358
We'll never know what really happened
to little Nicky's parents.

81
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,194
Courage, Andrew.
Do not despair, dear boy.

82
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,322
Next stop,
that selfsame orphanage.

83
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,241
And little Nicky's records within.

84
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,120
- Maybe we should tell Lucy.
- Absolutely not.

85
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,708
This, dear boy,
is strictly a man's job.

86
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,960
Follow me.

87
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,969
- Lucy.
- Hi.

88
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,804
Any luck?

89
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:57,017
I checked the personals columns
in every national newspaper on the list,

90
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,187
and I didn't see anything
that looked like a chess deal

91
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,440
or find any mention
of the name Windom Earle.

92
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,358
I'm sorry.

93
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,444
It's okay.

94
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,081
More coffee?

95
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,252
You bet.

96
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,011
Is everything all right, Ed?

97
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,389
Couldn't be better.

98
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,895
This is for you.

99
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,245
Bye for now.

100
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,247
Bye-bye.

101
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,588
Come on, Leo.

102
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,881
That's a good Leo.

103
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,844
Each day brings a new beginning.

104
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:19,266
And every hour, the promise of...

105
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,476
It was your turn to feed him, Bobby!

106
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,812
I got practice.

107
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,273
Football season is over.

108
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,360
Baseball.
Our national pastime?

109
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:34,489
Fine. You can clean
when you get back.

110
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,577
I ain't coming back.

111
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,579
What?

112
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,499
You're looking
at Ben Horne's brand-new boy.

113
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,836
Do the words "golden opportunity"
mean anything to you?

114
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,213
This is my big break, Shelly.

115
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,090
You don't think
I have anything better to do

116
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,758
than give Leo Johnson
a bubble bath?

117
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,260
And what about me, Bobby?

118
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,388
Do I not have anything better to do?

119
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,516
Not that I can think of.

120
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,314
Bobby.

121
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,568
Bobby!

122
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,829
God!

123
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,889
Big Ed's Gas Farm.

124
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,349
- Uncle Ed?
- James?

125
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,226
- Yeah, it's me.
- Where are you? Are you all right?

126
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,228
Oh, I'm okay.

127
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,231
Uh, look, I need a favor.

128
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,027
Um, I need you to get all the money
out of my savings account.

129
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,779
That's only $12, James.

130
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,781
Well, whatever's left.

131
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:02,202
And send it care of me to Wallies.
It's this bar out on 96.

132
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,953
Are you in trouble?

133
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,706
Um, no, I really can't talk about it.

134
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,584
- James...
- Listen, I really can't talk right now.

135
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,836
- Okay.
- We'll talk about it soon.

136
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,254
- Take care.
- Yeah.

137
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,091
- Call soon.
- Okay, bye.

138
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,135
- Long-distance?
- Twin Peaks.

139
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,179
Are you homesick, James?

140
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,682
No. Heh.

141
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,851
Tell me about Twin Peaks.

142
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,397
There's nothing to say.

143
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,317
You could start with why you left.

144
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,695
It was a woman, as I recall.

145
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,614
No, you said it was a few of them.

146
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,284
I loved a girl who died.

147
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,328
Her name was Laura.

148
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,500
And I thought I knew her,
but I didn't.

149
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,878
I guess nobody did.

150
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,797
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,593
My life used to make sense,
you know?

152
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,514
I didn't like it all the time,
but it was mine.

153
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,934
And I felt like it belonged to me.

154
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,649
And then Laura died.

155
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,779
And now I belong to something else.

156
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,283
To Laura.

157
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,958
And no matter what I did,

158
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,211
or how much I tried to help...

159
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,217
...another girl got murdered.

160
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,015
I just wanted to get on my bike
and ride away.

161
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:52,562
Take off, just go as far from
Twin Peaks as the thing will take me.

162
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,232
I know the feeling, James.

163
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,573
I know the feeling.

164
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,965
Why do you let him hurt you?

165
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,974
Jeffrey's leaving.

166
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,602
I need you. Will you help me?

167
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,438
- Mr. Marsh.
- What do you mean?

168
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:39,192
- I need your help.
- I'll put the bags in for you.

169
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,153
Very good, sir.

170
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,791
- Good morning, Mike Nelson.
- Oh, Lord.

171
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,710
You wanna share a soda?

172
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:02,715
How about a nice big piece
of cherry pie? Two forks.

173
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,635
Mrs. Hurley, Nadine,
I want my own piece of cherry pie.

174
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:10,139
In fact, I want two pieces
of cherry pie, by myself.

175
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,560
Okay. Meat loaf.

176
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:17,689
No. Cherry pie and coffee.
In fact, I want 16 cups of coffee.

177
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,566
I don't wanna talk with you,
walk with you.

178
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,526
I don't wanna see you,
I don't wanna know you.

179
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,069
Is that clear enough to understand?

180
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:27,323
Or do I need a court order
to get my point across?

181
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,829
Mike Nelson,

182
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:37,500
you are the handsomest boy
I've ever known.

183
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,879
And I would really like it

184
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:45,717
if you and I could go out on a date.

185
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,399
I'm sorry.

186
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,403
Sometimes I can't help myself.

187
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,340
Hey, Norma. Where are you going?

188
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,801
Oh, I have to run some errands.

189
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,762
It's a little early for errands, isn't it?

190
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,680
We've still got most
of the breakfast crowd.

191
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,142
Just you and a kitchen full
of scrambled eggs.

192
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,977
I'll be right back.

193
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,148
Just think of it as a test, Hank.

194
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,115
I'll do that.

195
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,559
I thought you were moving
into my place.

196
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,478
- I'm sorry.
- What happened?

197
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,397
What the hell are you doing here?

198
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,691
- This is my home.
- Home?

199
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,944
After everything Catherine
has done to you?

200
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,072
I have no choice.

201
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:37,996
Josie.

202
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,837
- Oh, go home.
- Josie, let me take care of you.

203
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,881
- No.
- Please.

204
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,051
Listen, I'm safe here.
And when I'm here,

205
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,679
- you're safe too.
- No.

206
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,688
Stop.

207
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,107
Look at me.

208
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,151
I'm Catherine's maid.

209
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,987
I'm no good for you.

210
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,991
You are good for me.

211
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,620
I love you.

212
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,208
I want you.

213
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,788
Lucille...

214
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,375
What?

215
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,920
What's wrong?

216
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,713
Yes, sir, general.

217
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:15,468
I want you to lead the charge
on Little Round Top.

218
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,178
Yes, sir.

219
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,472
Yes, sir!

220
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,101
And where is General Stuart?
And his cavalry?

221
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,312
He's a-coming, sir.
Damn his eyes.

222
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,731
- He's coming, sir. I know it!
- Daddy.

223
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,942
- He's coming. He had better be.
- Daddy.

224
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,194
For all our sakes.

225
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:37,573
Because the enemy,
we meet the enemy here.

226
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,743
We meet him before morning.

227
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,496
- We meet him here.
- Daddy.

228
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,584
Yes, darling?

229
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,088
What are you doing?

230
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,967
There's a war going on, darling.

231
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,718
A war?

232
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,471
A war between the states.

233
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,810
Daddy, I think you need some help.

234
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,021
No, no, I'm all right, darling.

235
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:14,694
I just need a little time.
This is a very important day.

236
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,654
Yes, Daddy,
this is a very important day.

237
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,531
We're gonna save the business.

238
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,950
- You and I.
- Darling, darling.

239
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,743
Yes, Daddy?

240
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,538
You are standing on General Stuart.

241
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,419
General Lee!

242
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:36,257
General Lee! Yes, sir.
Old Jeb, he's come.

243
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,969
Oh, I don't need any more wagons!

244
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,639
I want my eyes
and my ears beside me.

245
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,474
- Get me General Stuart.
- This is Audrey.

246
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,060
- I need you to get me Jerry Horne.
- Bring me General Norton.

247
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,563
- Ready the men of the Alabama 15th.
- This is an emergency.

248
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,945
- I've been figuring that we have to...
- I think we need to talk about what...

249
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,158
Come on in.

250
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,498
You first.

251
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,876
Okay.

252
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,589
You're the last thing I think of
when I go to sleep at night.

253
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,633
And you're the first thought
on my mind

254
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,760
when I get up in the morning.

255
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,013
I know this world is going to pieces,

256
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,516
and it feels like it's designed
to keep us apart.

257
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,437
But we love each other, Ed.

258
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,524
I wanna be with you.

259
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,028
I wanna be with you
no matter what happens.

260
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:52,208
Ed. Ed, Ed. Your turn.

261
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,252
Later.

262
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,099
Ouch! Will you mind the chest hair,
will you?

263
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,184
You're sweating like a pig, Mr. Niles.

264
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,187
Oh, thanks a lot. Huh?

265
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,191
That's nervous perspiration, man.
Hyperhidrosis.

266
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,609
It's a childhood condition.

267
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,947
I didn't notice it till the war.
Korea, remember that year?

268
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,908
I was leading a battalion
up towards the 49th parallel.

269
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,411
We were just a bunch
of fresh-faced kids.

270
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,830
I didn't know what kind of hell
we were stepping into.

271
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:35,251
Ernie. Ernie, I want you to focus
on the here and now.

272
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,712
Repeat your instructions to me
step by step.

273
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,840
Okay. Uh...

274
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:46,804
I take Denise up to Dead Dog Farm.

275
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,599
- I introduce her to Renault.
- Right.

276
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:55,229
I, uh, take Renault through the buy,

277
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,606
complete the transaction
and get the hell out of there.

278
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:01,736
Good. Harry?
That's when you come in.

279
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,199
By golly, I sure wish
I could join you fellas.

280
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,702
But I've temporarily lost
my enforcement franchise.

281
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,871
- I'll bet.
- Well,

282
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,956
I've been giving that
some thought.

283
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,418
Consider yourself deputized.

284
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,213
The Bureau's loss is my gain.

285
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,592
I hope I can live up to this.

286
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,888
He's done. You might wanna
towel him off before we go.

287
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,140
Come on.

288
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:36,103
Uh, how long will it, uh,
take you guys

289
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:40,024
to storm the farmhouse after, uh,
I complete the buy?

290
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,193
You go out, we come in.

291
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,446
- Can I ask you a question?
- What, Ernie?

292
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,740
Don't make me do this.
This isn't my line of work.

293
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,534
I'm a coward. I don't do
this kind of thing, I'm a CPA.

294
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,411
- Ernie.
- Ernie.

295
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:56,749
Heh. Just a momentary lapse.
Look, I'm cool.

296
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,167
Let's go do it, huh?

297
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,588
- Where's Denise?
- I haven't seen her.

298
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,966
You can call me Dennis.

299
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,679
Oh, I don't know,
somehow it seemed more appropriate.

300
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,935
- What do you think?
- Whew.

301
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,570
Our investigation
must proceed sub rosa.

302
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:33,077
We may have to pick the lock.
Tricky business.

303
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,791
Voilà. We enter.

304
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,420
- Where is everybody?
- Lunch.

305
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,422
Here we are, the case files.

306
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,675
N, N.

307
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,803
N, N!

308
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:58,936
Nails, Neaster,
Neatherby, Needleman.

309
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,897
Nicholas Needleman,
our little Nicky.

310
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,650
- We can read it in the car.
- Patience, Andrew.

311
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,404
- Dick.
- The usual background information.

312
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,449
Hmm. Birthplace,

313
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,410
initial adoption.

314
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,955
Hmm. First of several, it seems.

315
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,957
Dick.

316
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,085
Ah, the plot thickens.

317
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,840
Where are thy secrets, little Nicky?

318
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,967
Dick.

319
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,598
Hi.

320
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,813
We're the Brunstons.

321
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,149
Heh, I know we're a little early.

322
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,401
It's just that we're so darn eager
to see him.

323
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,029
Can we see him? Where is Donnie?

324
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:54,575
Uh, little Donnie is... dead.

325
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,914
Ah! Dead tired, I mean.

326
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,835
I'm afraid little Donnie,
he isn't feeling up to snuff.

327
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,838
Well, he was in perfect health
only yesterday.

328
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,842
- Dick.
- Just a minute.

329
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,930
Woody, let me finish helping
these good people.

330
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,725
Now, where were we?

331
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,812
Ed. Ed, it's Donna.

332
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,859
- I need your help, Ed.
- What can I do for you, honey?

333
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,402
Well, I've been looking for James.

334
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,947
He hasn't been in school,
no one's seen him at the diner.

335
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,199
I even went by his house,
but I can't find him.

336
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,660
Listen, James is fine. He called.

337
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:42,039
He asked me to send him some money
in care of a bar out on 96.

338
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,375
We didn't talk long.

339
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,753
- It's all I know.
- I'll take it to him.

340
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,421
Well, what about your folks?

341
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,924
I'll explain, they'll understand.

342
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,678
- Okay.
- Thanks, Ed.

343
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,228
I have to get going.

344
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,397
I'll call.

345
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,441
- We have a lot to talk about.
- Yeah.

346
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,236
- Bye.
- Bye.

347
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,955
Oh, Ed. The things we do for love.

348
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,217
Eddie, I'm home. Ugh!

349
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,138
Eddie! Look out!

350
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,952
You big bully!

351
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,378
Eddie?

352
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,049
Can you hear me?

353
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:19,219
- Nadine?
- Yeah, Nadine's here.

354
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,182
Don't you worry about a thing, baby.

355
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,101
Nadine will take care of everything.

356
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,561
Oh.

357
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,405
Colonel Chamberlain
and the 20th Maine

358
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:42,826
were trapped at the summit
of Little Round Top.

359
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,163
Now, his only chance

360
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,958
is to maneuver his left flank

361
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,337
down the hillside
like a swinging gate.

362
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,047
But we were waiting for him, Bobby.

363
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:02,388
And Chamberlain's desperate
maneuver ended, Bobby, in failure.

364
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:06,141
- Mr. Horne...
- Little Round Top, Bobby, was ours.

365
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:11,188
From that vantage point, we were able
to roll back the Federal lines.

366
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,609
Setting the stage
for Pickett's mighty charge, Bobby.

367
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,321
And victory!

368
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,829
Victory. Hurray.

369
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,425
General Meade,

370
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:45,305
you have suffered an ignoble defeat.

371
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:50,686
And I accept
your unconditional surrender.

372
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,358
Okay, tell you what, Mr. Horne.

373
00:28:56,526 --> 00:29:00,529
I'm gonna go and talk
to President Lincoln first, okay?

374
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,074
So you just wait right here and...

375
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,248
And, uh, I'll get back to you
on this whole surrender thing.

376
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,916
Okay? Gotta go.

377
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,630
Don't, uh, wanna keep
the president waiting.

378
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,508
Sir!

379
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,974
Baby, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

380
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:33,520
The bad news is that your old man
just bought a condo in Flip City.

381
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,857
The good news is that he's about
to win the Civil War.

382
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,484
I know.

383
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,612
Uncle Jerry said he was coming home
on the next plane.

384
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,282
Dr. Jacoby said
he would come over tomorrow.

385
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,327
I think Daddy needs an injection.

386
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,329
God, we gotta help him.

387
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,040
Don't worry, baby,
Bobby's on the case.

388
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,501
Don't call me baby.

389
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,851
Enter lively.

390
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,439
Catherine.

391
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,197
Hello, Ben.

392
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,661
You've come here to gloat,
haven't you? Huh?

393
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,998
To, uh, celebrate my demise.

394
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,170
Well, you go ahead. You laugh.

395
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,966
You defeated me,

396
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:48,011
as I have defeated General Meade.

397
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,223
It's true.

398
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,726
I did come here to gloat.

399
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,191
You double-crossed me.

400
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,110
You tried to kill me.

401
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:08,198
And I wanted to bury you so deeply

402
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:13,161
that future generations would unearth
and exhibit your remains.

403
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,874
Slimy rat bastard Americanus.

404
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,376
Do not feed.

405
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,008
Do not trust.

406
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,096
I suppose that, uh...

407
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,476
hat I'm not that trustworthy.

408
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:48,113
Despite everything
I know about you,

409
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,743
I find myself here with you.

410
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,913
Wanting you.

411
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,207
You can't be serious.

412
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,923
I want you, Ben.

413
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:11,845
Horrifying as it seems,
I can't escape it.

414
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,265
You, uh...

415
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,938
You make my body hum.

416
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,528
Kiss me, General Lee.

417
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,924
On to victory!

418
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:53,345
Hurry up, Jim.
The champagne's getting warm.

419
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,055
Don't call me Jim.

420
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,519
All right, all right, all right.

421
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,024
- James, what?
- You may look.

422
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,987
Any place you wanna go?

423
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,408
Jeffrey will be home by midnight.

424
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,410
Doesn't leave us a lot of time.

425
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,081
Well, I'll take what we can get.

426
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,333
It's a deal.

427
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,345
To handsome strangers.

428
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,888
And rebuilt engines.

429
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,021
You know, I never thought
I'd see it drive again.

430
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,939
You're a miracle worker.

431
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,399
No, honest.

432
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,028
You're being too modest.

433
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,489
Oh, go on. You deserve it.

434
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,533
You're strong and you're kind.

435
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,661
You have a wonderfully honest face,
James.

436
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,331
Don't laugh, it's quite rare.

437
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,461
Every time I look at you,
I could tell exactly what you're thinking.

438
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,339
Well, I'd better be careful
about what I'm thinking.

439
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,883
Don't be too careful.

440
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,469
Not on my account.

441
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,265
So, what are your plans?

442
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,642
I don't really have any plans.

443
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,020
Where will you go?

444
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,105
I don't know.

445
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:31,568
- James, don't.
- What?

446
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,029
I don't want you to leave.

447
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,157
Give me some more time, James.

448
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,786
I can think of a hundred reasons
for you to stay.

449
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,886
You sure you don't wanna wait
for Hank?

450
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,389
He told me this morning
he wanted in on all of this.

451
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,058
- I think we should wait...
- We'll start without him.

452
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,144
Whatever you say.

453
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,066
You're sweating. Is something wrong?

454
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,902
Sweaty. You know, it's hyperhidrosis.

455
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,654
It's a childhood condition.

456
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,865
I was living in Guam at the time.

457
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,491
I contracted yellow fever.

458
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,161
The effects are vicious.

459
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,999
You know, sweating is one
of the more socially unacceptable.

460
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,335
Sit down, Ernie. Take a deep breath.

461
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:16,214
- Socially unacceptable.
- Everything seems to be in order.

462
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,800
Do you think we could hurry this up?
I got a plane to catch.

463
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,930
Jean. Jean, take a look,
his shirt is smoking.

464
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,102
The wire's dead.

465
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,229
Cooper!

466
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,523
Hawk.

467
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,984
- Cooper!
- Coop.

468
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,613
He came for me, Harry.

469
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,115
I want safe passage to the border.

470
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,159
First, release the hostages.

471
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,370
We're at cross-purposes, Cooper.

472
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,289
We'll kill you if you don't.

473
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,458
Then everybody dies.

474
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,045
No, we'll trade.

475
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,381
Trade?

476
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,843
Ernie Niles
and agent Bryson for me.

477
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,511
Coop.

478
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,315
- I want backup.
- State police?

479
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,234
Call them in.

480
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,489
Lucy, it's Hawk.

481
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,575
Patch me through
to the state police.

482
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,489
How's our baby boy?

483
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,533
Sound asleep.

484
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,994
Dreaming of love.

485
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:20,171
Lucky, lucky, lucky boy.

486
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:27,220
Lucky, lucky, lucky.

487
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,734
They moved him to the center room.

488
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,986
Andy, keep steady.

489
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,865
More deputies.

490
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,951
Sharpshooters.

491
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,496
Let's deal or let's run.

492
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,962
Will they let us run, Agent Cooper?

493
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,716
No.

494
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,511
So you think they will deal?

495
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,598
No.

496
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,351
What do you suggest we do?

497
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,936
Surrender.

498
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,400
Okay.

499
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,487
Are you crazy?

500
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,988
No.

501
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:32,786
But first, we must decide
to give up quietly or to kill him.

502
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:38,333
- Then we both die.
- I know.

503
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,878
Is my death so important to you?

504
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,673
My two brothers died.

505
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,801
I hold you responsible.

506
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,804
Why?

507
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,607
Before you came here,

508
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,902
Twin Peaks was a simple place.

509
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:11,282
My brothers deal dope
to the teenagers and the truck drivers.

510
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,369
One-Eyed Jack's welcomed
the businessmen and the tourists.

511
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,831
Quiet people lived a quiet life.

512
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,835
Then, a pretty girl die,

513
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:27,132
and you arrive,
and everything change.

514
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,259
My brother Bernard,

515
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:34,681
shot and left to die in the woods.

516
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:39,018
A grieving father smother
my remaining brother with a pillow.

517
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,564
Kidnapping. Death.

518
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:48,153
Suddenly, the quiet people,
they're quiet no more.

519
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:54,868
Suddenly, the simple dream
become the nightmare.

520
00:40:55,035 --> 00:41:00,915
So if you die,
maybe you will be the last to die.

521
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:06,171
Maybe you brought
the nightmare with you.

522
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:09,340
And maybe the nightmare

523
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:13,261
will die with you.

524
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,765
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

525
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:23,271
But I do know
we've got a damn problem here.

526
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:27,066
And if you're not gonna solve it,
I will.

527
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,445
- Jean.
- What?

528
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,863
Take a look at this.

529
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,366
- You order any food?
- No.

530
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,077
No, no, no, let her come.

531
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,537
Let her come.

532
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,289
It's just a girl.

533
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,640
- Hello.
- Suppertime.

534
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,693
Don't I know you?

535
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,724
Are you okay?

536
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,685
Yeah.

537
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,728
Quick thinking, Denise.

538
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,272
It was just my legs.

539
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:51,526
Thank Sheriff Truman.
It was his idea.

540
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,613
Harry S. Truman.

541
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,700
Sometimes you gotta improvise.

542
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,910
He's dead.

543
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,723
Bobby?

544
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,273
Bobby?

545
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,589
Bobby, this isn't funny.

546
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,886
Bobby?

547
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,061
Leo?

548
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,482
Shelly.

549
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,864
Bomb. What do you mean, bomb?

550
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:23,201
- Start at the beginning.
- Well, the voice on the phone said

551
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,578
that there was a bomb
planted in the woods,

552
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,330
but it didn't say which woods.

553
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,957
Then all of a sudden,
there was this huge explosion

554
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,126
and all the lights went out.

555
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,878
So then I called
the fire department.

556
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,130
- Good work, Lucy.
- Was there a fire?

557
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,050
Two of them. First there was one
at the power station.

558
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,885
But most
of the volunteer fire department...

559
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,554
I'm gonna go check on the generator.
Something's not right.

560
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,556
Okay. So?

561
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,434
- Were playing bingo, so it took a while
to get everybody together.

562
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,603
- Excuse me, Lucy.
- Then there was the explosion

563
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,231
I told you about, which sounded
like it was right upstairs,

564
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,067
so we all got out of here.
Well, it turned out to be a transformer

565
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,152
on the pole right behind
and above the building.

566
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,029
Well, we had to wait
to go back inside

567
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,864
because it was shooting sparks
everywhere

568
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,534
and we were afraid that the station
was gonna catch on fire too.

569
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,743
But it didn't.

570
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,286
Do they know how it started?

571
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,997
Suspicious in nature,
that's what Chief Kipple said.

572
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,208
He was suffering
from smoke inhalation at the time,

573
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,335
so he sounded a little hoarse.

574
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,962
You should hear his cough.

575
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,131
I'm gonna make him
some chicken soup.

576
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,259
- Harry?
- Yeah, Coop.

577
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,554
You'd better take a look at this, alone.

578
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,889
Lucy, wait here.

579
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,191
Good Lord.

580
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,446
Who is it?

581
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,156
I don't know.

582
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,033
It's a chess game.

583
00:45:46,535 --> 00:46:55,269
Windom Earle's next move.
