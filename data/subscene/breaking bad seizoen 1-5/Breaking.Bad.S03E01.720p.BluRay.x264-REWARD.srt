1
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:17,715
We interrupt scheduled programming
to bring you this breaking news.

2
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,051
Good afternoon.
In the last several minutes...

3
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,303
...KOB has received
dozens of reports...

4
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,973
...of what appears to be a crashed
aircraft, possibly two aircraft...

5
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,975
...on Albuquerque's east side.

6
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,769
As of yet details are scarce...

7
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,980
...but callers describe witnessing
an explosion overhead...

8
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,232
...followed by falling debris.
Visible now...

9
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,778
- crash investigators with the
National Transportation Safety Board...

10
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,781
...are expected on site
as early as this evening.

11
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:42,949
But officials warn...

12
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,993
...that with a debris field
of this magnitude, the investigation...

13
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,788
Officials are now saying
that the Boeing 737...

14
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,291
...was being re-routed,
or vectored, through the airspace...

15
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,753
...which is standard procedure
according to a spokesman for the FAA.

16
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,256
The eight-seat King Air 350
was a charter flight...

17
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,678
...operating out of St. George, Utah,
bound for Amarillo, Texas.

18
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,931
It sounded like hail,
like heavy hailstones.

19
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:12,019
It was just bump-bump-bump,
all over the neighborhood...

20
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:16,899
- indicating that the final death toll
now stands at 167.

21
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:20,861
- One hundred and sixty-seven.

22
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,364
This mid-air collision
has left many wondering...

23
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,491
...how such an accident
could take place...

24
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,326
...in a system
with so many safeguards.

25
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,996
- That the collision
which brought down Flight 515...

26
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,624
...was caused
by improper air traffic control.

27
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,669
We have the bombshell confirmation
out of Oklahoma City...

28
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,045
...as the FAA confirmed...

29
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:42,174
...it was indeed a lone
air traffic controller's fateful mistake...

30
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,968
...which brought about the crash.

31
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,847
- Is Donald Margolis,
a 19-year veteran...

32
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:52,143
...of the FAA's Air Route Traffic
Control Center in Albuquerque...

33
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,022
- Margolis recently returned to work
after a five-week absence...

34
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,482
...which was due to, quote,
"a personal loss".

35
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,570
While it's now known that Margolis
had recently lost a daughter to a...

36
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,238
- drug overdose a month before.

37
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,241
His troubled daughter Jane Margolis,
aged 26...

38
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,411
...apparently had a long history
of substance abuse.

39
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,912
Friends of the family say...

40
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,082
...the death of his only child
hit Margolis particularly hard.

41
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,086
Coming as it did
little more than a month before...

42
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,089
...many are questioning
the timing of his return to work...

43
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,592
...and are wondering
how much blame truly lies...

44
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,053
...with those
who let this grieving father...

45
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,710
I usually open with
"So sorry you're here."

46
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,004
Where would you like to begin?

47
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,215
I really just need this quick and easy,
you know?

48
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:33,220
As quick as something like this
can be. So...

49
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:38,893
Okay. Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?

50
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,312
Does he know?

51
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,232
Well, I mean, he certainly knows
we're separated, so...

52
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,901
Has he moved out?

53
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,195
We're in the process
of moving him out.

54
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,571
Yeah. Today, hopefully.

55
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,742
And in the meantime,
my son and my daughter...

56
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,660
...and I are staying with my sister.

57
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,539
- So you've moved out?
- Well, yes, just temporarily.

58
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,000
Only so he could
get his things and...

59
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:07,087
That was supposed to happen last
week, but then came the crash and...

60
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,173
Oh, God, you weren't one of the...?

61
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,259
Right, yeah.
Right beneath the flight path.

62
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:18,766
And we had debris land in our yard,
and all over our neighborhood, so...

63
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,769
- Terrible.
- Yeah. Apparently, even...

64
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,939
...you know, parts of bodies.

65
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,777
So I certainly couldn't
bring myself to...

66
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,946
- So awful.
- I know.

67
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,449
Anyway, I was certainly not ready
to move back. But it's time.

68
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:40,537
And I'm sure we're driving
my sister and her husband up a wall.

69
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,291
Well, you definitely wanna maintain
residency in your actual home.

70
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,212
It just puts you in a better position
in regards to custody.

71
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,630
Two children, you said?

72
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:56,595
Yes. Holly here, and then I have a son
in high school, Walter Jr.

73
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,934
- They need to stay with me.
- Okay.

74
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,145
- How long have you been married?
- Sixteen years.

75
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,065
And it's not an apartment,
it's a house that you live in?

76
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,485
Do you own outright,
do you have a mortgage?

77
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:16,615
Yes, there's definitely a mortgage.
We have maybe 15 years on it.

78
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,660
What about other debts or assets?

79
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,912
Do you feel
you have a good understanding...

80
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,415
...of you and your husband's
financial situation?

81
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,754
- Is your husband employed?
- Here's the thing.

82
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:35,175
I'm really not looking
for any sort of loopholes...

83
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:39,680
...or I don't know, just...
- No, no loopholes.

84
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:44,184
I just intend that every one of my clients
get a full and honest accounting...

85
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:48,522
...of what it is they owe
and what it is they own.

86
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,693
To that end,
I say let's leave no stone unturned.

87
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,949
You'd be amazed what I've seen
partners hide from one another.

88
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,190
Walt?

89
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,192
Hey, buddy?

90
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,997
Hey, Walt?

91
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,375
- Hey.
- There you are.

92
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,419
Listen, I... You know, well...

93
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,922
It's...

94
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,924
It's time.

95
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,349
The shittiest week since 9/11, okay?
Bar none.

96
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,434
This is it.
Hands down, we're living it.

97
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,852
I speak with authority...

98
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,730
...because we had some shitty weeks
the past few months.

99
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,107
But this here? I mean...

100
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,443
...call freaking Guinness Book
of World Records, call freaking...

101
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,946
Am I talking too much?
I am, right? I am, I know.

102
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:23,117
But this situation between you and...
You know, I don't know.

103
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,786
I'm not asking, by the way.
It's none of my business.

104
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,080
I do not wanna get
in the middle of you two.

105
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,082
I'm just saying, listen, okay?

106
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,626
You beat a little tactical retreat...

107
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:36,213
...you regroup, and then:

108
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:41,593
You know, absence makes the...
Yeah.

109
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,809
I'm pulling for you, man.
I'm pulling for you.

110
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,443
- No heavy lifting. I got it.
- No, it's okay.

111
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,486
I got it.

112
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:03,574
Jesus. What do you got in there,
cinder blocks?

113
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,246
Half a million in cash.

114
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,795
That's the spirit.

115
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,301
I got it, I got it.

116
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,616
Who's here for self-improvement?

117
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,037
Come on, give me a show of hands.

118
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:57,211
Who among you is here hoping they
can actively improve who they are?

119
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:06,220
All right. See, that's your first mistake.

120
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,890
You should be here
to learn self-acceptance.

121
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,733
Hey, honey,
you want another waffle?

122
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:25,697
I still got the iron out.
I could cut up some bananas.

123
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:31,954
Hi, you've reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn
and Holly. Please leave us a message.

124
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,374
Hey. Hello, everybody.
Good morning.

125
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,917
I was just checking in...

126
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,712
...and thought I'd pass along
the current contact information.

127
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,173
You certainly
can always reach me on my cell...

128
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:47,511
...I've always got that on me,
but in terms of a mailing address...

129
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,763
...I'm here at the Beachcomber...

130
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,433
...and you know what,
it's actually very nice, very pleasant.

131
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,186
Not as high-end as the Oakwood,
but not as corporate...

132
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:00,857
- Oh, hey, would you please just...?
- Hey, Dad, it's me.

133
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,193
No, I'm not okay.

134
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,028
I don't know what's going on.

135
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,114
Nobody's telling me jackshit
around here.

136
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,408
- Hey, Flynn.
- Whatever.

137
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,368
I don't even care anymore.

138
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,954
Can you just give me
a ride to school?

139
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:19,376
- I'll take you to school.
- Yeah. No, I'm ready now.

140
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,713
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.

141
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:28,051
All right, I'm here. See you soon.

142
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,082
Okay.

143
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,967
May I have your attention, please?

144
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,888
As all of you know, last week
our city suffered a terrible tragedy.

145
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,890
One that none of us will ever forget.

146
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,727
Which is why today we're going to
take a little time out of our schedule...

147
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,563
...to gather in the gym and talk.

148
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:11,238
I just find it, you know,
really, really hard to concentrate.

149
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:17,077
Because of all the horrors, you know,
we perceived.

150
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,123
It just really
gets inside your brain and...

151
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:26,378
In college, they have this thing
where if your roommate kills himself...

152
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,257
...like, if you come home and find him
hanging in the closet or whatever...

153
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:34,386
...it's basically an automatic A
for you.

154
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,098
And I just think
that that kind of compassion is...

155
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,934
- Is something to...
- Okay. Thank you, Barry.

156
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,728
Who wants to go next?

157
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,358
No judgments, guys. Just feelings.

158
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:54,156
You can say anything and everything
that's on your mind. Anyone?

159
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,202
There you go, honey.

160
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,540
I just keep asking myself...

161
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,793
Honey, could you please stand up?

162
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,588
Thank you.

163
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,258
I just keep asking myself,
"Why did this happen?"

164
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,762
I mean, if there's a God and all...

165
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,474
...why does he allow all those
innocent people to die for no reason?

166
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,977
Okay, can we just keep it secular,
honey?

167
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,773
Anyhow, I haven't
really been sleeping much.

168
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,233
Does anyone else have that?

169
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:36,281
I just keep hearing that sound.

170
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,327
That boom.

171
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:45,582
It just plays over and over in my head
like it won't ever stop.

172
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,838
Thank you, sweetheart.

173
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:55,967
- Is there anyone else?
- Over here.

174
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:04,768
My neighbor, he heard the crash...

175
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,022
...and he ran outside,
and he found, like, this seat.

176
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,316
Like an airline seat.

177
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,193
Like what you have on an airliner?

178
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:18,031
Well, anyway, the seat was standing
perfectly upright in his front yard...

179
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:22,869
...right next to his Sea-Doos,
because, like, he has Sea-Doos.

180
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:27,499
But there was still a pair of legs
buckled into them.

181
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,960
Human legs.

182
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,630
Jesus H. Christ.

183
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,678
- You okay?
- Yeah, sorry. I'm...

184
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,014
I was just moved.

185
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,142
Maybe we should hear
from the faculty.

186
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:51,523
Certainly this tragedy
didn't only affect our students.

187
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,651
Mr. White,
would you like to say something?

188
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,822
And by the way, welcome back.

189
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,667
It's so good to have you back.

190
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:31,354
I guess what I would... Sorry, sorry.

191
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,736
I guess what I would wanna say is...

192
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,741
...to look on the bright side.

193
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,622
First of all,
nobody on the ground was killed.

194
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,248
And that...

195
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:54,920
I mean, an incident like this,
over a populated urban center?

196
00:20:55,087 --> 00:21:00,884
That right there, that's just gotta be
some minor miracle. So...

197
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,304
Plus, neither plane was full.

198
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:10,977
You know, the 737 was, what, maybe
two-thirds full, I believe? Right, yes?

199
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,563
Or maybe even three-quarters full?

200
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:18,276
Well, at any rate,
what you're left with casualty-wise...

201
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,489
...is just the 50th-worst air disaster.

202
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,659
Actually, tied for 50th.

203
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,662
There are, in truth...

204
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:34,167
...53 crashes throughout history...

205
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:38,630
...that are just as bad or worse.
Tenerife.

206
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,801
Has anybody?
Anybody hear of Tenerife? No?

207
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:48,139
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s...

208
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,850
...crashed into each other on Tenerife.

209
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,021
Does anybody know how big
a 747 is?

210
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:59,442
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737,
and we're talking about two of them.

211
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,947
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.

212
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:09,703
But do any of you even remember it
at all? Any of you? I doubt it.

213
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:16,042
You know why?
It's because people move on.

214
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,378
They just move on.

215
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:22,132
And we will too. We will move on,
and we will get past this.

216
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:29,055
Because that is what
human beings do, we survive, and...

217
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:34,811
We survive and we overcome. Yeah.

218
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:39,190
We survive. We survive and...

219
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,819
- Okay?
- Thank you.

220
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,238
Good.

221
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,649
Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?

222
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,987
Fine. I guess.

223
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,741
You make sure you say hello to her
for me, will you?

224
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:38,912
Why don't you just come inside?
It's your house.

225
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,873
No, I...

226
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,451
He's gone.

227
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,582
Hey, Flynn. How's tricks?

228
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,794
- How's what?
- Tricks. It's an expression.

229
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,712
How are you?

230
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,091
Why you gotta treat him like this?

231
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,759
Why you gotta be like this?

232
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:39,472
- Why can't you just talk even?
- Hey, hey, hey. Cool down, okay?

233
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,195
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?

234
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,119
You know, try not to hold it
against him.

235
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:06,958
You know, I mean, the poor kid,
he's probably just dying of curiosity.

236
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:12,463
You know, and I guess
it would be natural for him to wonder.

237
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,259
He's probably wondering, "What is it
that could have gone so wrong...

238
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:19,137
- Marie. Marie.
...that my mother would leave...?"

239
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,097
I can't help you get through this...

240
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,350
...you know, if you won't tell me
what it is that Walt did?

241
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:28,021
Well, you know what, I don't remember
asking you, all right?

242
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,691
So if you wanna be supportive,
you could be supportive without prying.

243
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,818
- That would be really great...
- "Prying."

244
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:38,031
...and so helpful.
- Well, prying's a strong word.

245
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:48,791
It's that voice inside your head.

246
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,839
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard,
24/7 voice.

247
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,550
You know what I'm talking about.

248
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,553
That voice that tells you
you're not good enough.

249
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:04,724
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to be what...

250
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,143
...president of the United States?

251
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,646
Well, okay,
so maybe you're not that good.

252
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:12,523
But now...

253
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:17,528
...are you good enough to deserve
your share of basic human happiness?

254
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:22,700
Are you good enough to be okay
with who and what you are?

255
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,078
I say yes.

256
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,417
But it doesn't matter what I say.

257
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,754
It's your voice, which means
you're the one that hears it.

258
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:38,925
Which means you're the only one
that can fight it, right?

259
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:42,929
Jesse, we never hear from you.

260
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:48,935
What's going on? You can tell me
I'm full of shit. It's okay, I don't mind.

261
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:52,605
Just come on. Let us in on it.

262
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,741
So, like, what makes you the expert?

263
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,619
I don't think I ever said I was that.

264
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,455
Yeah, but you're the one
sitting here, right?

265
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:16,462
Telling us "thus" and "so," "be happy,"
"forgive yourself," blah, blah, blah.

266
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,049
Have you ever really hurt anybody?

267
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:25,430
I don't just mean disappointed
your mother or whatever...

268
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:31,477
...but did you ever really
hurt someone?

269
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,983
I killed my daughter.

270
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:47,452
It was July 18th,
which is my birthday.

271
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,998
July 18th, 1992.

272
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:55,835
I was high on cocaine
and I was drunk.

273
00:29:56,003 --> 00:30:00,298
Cocaine wasn't an issue. I had bought
myself two grams as a birthday present.

274
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:01,966
I had plenty left.

275
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,760
But I was out of vodka.

276
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,846
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia...

277
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,308
...where instead of selling liquor
in the supermarkets...

278
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,268
...they have these ABC stores...

279
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:18,399
...which close at 5 p.m.,
and right then it was like 4:42.

280
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:22,487
So I'm arguing with my wife.

281
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,491
"Come on. Go to the ABC for me,
it's my birthday.

282
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:31,204
Come on.
They're not gonna sell it to me."

283
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,624
And she's saying "No, no."

284
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:40,671
So I'm pissed. And the clock is ticking,
so I jump in my truck.

285
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:45,343
She's my 6-year-old daughter.

286
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,680
She's playing
at the end of the driveway.

287
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,392
So...

288
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,151
How do you not hate yourself?

289
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,405
I did hate myself for a long time.

290
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:11,536
But it didn't stop me
from drinking and getting high.

291
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,413
It just made it that much worse.

292
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,087
Self-hatred, guilt,
it accomplishes nothing.

293
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,923
It just stands in the way.

294
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,218
Stands in the way of what?

295
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,762
True change.

296
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,003
Skyler.

297
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,380
Is this a good time to talk?

298
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,134
Yeah. Come in. Please.

299
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,766
Skyler.

300
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,247
Do you wanna start?

301
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,508
Okay.

302
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:13,783
Why are you doing this?
Why are you even thinking this way?

303
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,037
- Is it to punish me?
- I am not punishing you, Walt.

304
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:23,501
This is punitive, is what this is.
We are happily married.

305
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:29,674
I am happily married. I am happy.
We're just...

306
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:41,727
I love you, Skyler.
And I would do anything for you.

307
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:49,235
Would you even consider?
I mean, Jesus!

308
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:52,905
You come in here and you wave
these papers in my face...

309
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:58,077
...when there's a whole other,
entire side to this thing.

310
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:02,248
There's your side and there's my side,
and you haven't heard my side yet.

311
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,208
You haven't heard any of it at all.

312
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,544
You're a drug dealer.

313
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:14,760
No. What...? How? What?

314
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,063
Yeah.

315
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,444
How else could you possibly
make that kind of money?

316
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,411
Marijuana. That Pinkman kid.

317
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,628
No?

318
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,800
Oh, my God, Walt.

319
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,721
Cocaine?

320
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,560
It's methamphetamine.

321
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:11,901
But I'm a manufacturer,
I'm not a dealer...

322
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,322
...per se.

323
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,117
It doesn't mean... No, Skyler!

324
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,828
- Listen to me. Skyler, listen...
- No, no!

325
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:26,457
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?

326
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:31,629
So please, let's... Please, let's just
sit back down and talk it through.

327
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,590
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.

328
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:39,512
I won't tell Hank and I won't tell
your children or anybody else.

329
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,597
Nobody will hear it from me.

330
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,518
But only if you grant me this divorce
and stay out of our lives.

331
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,270
- No, Skyler...
- I mean it.

332
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,982
Now let me the hell out of here
before I throw up.

333
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,001
Bye, Jesse.

334
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,855
Your windshield's broken.

335
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,025
Yeah.

336
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,743
Little friction
in the marriage right now.

337
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,913
Strictly temporary. We're just...

338
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,332
We're just taking a little break.

339
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:55,087
That's you, over there.

340
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,925
Listen, money.

341
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,554
Saul has got it for you,
so as soon as you're feeling better...

342
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,598
I'm better.

343
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,935
You're better? Really?

344
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:16,442
- What, the rehab? It helped?
- Yeah. I'm done using.

345
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,738
That's excellent. That's...

346
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:26,744
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy, very good.

347
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:33,709
You know,
in spite of how bad things got...

348
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:38,464
...it really could be looked at
like a wake-up call for both of us.

349
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:43,636
I mean, you know, just to get our lives
back together again...

350
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,973
...and on the straight and narrow.

351
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:53,729
You been following
this airplane crash?

352
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,982
Yeah.

353
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:01,946
You know it was Jane's dad who
accidentally crashed them together...

354
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,156
...because he was so torn up?

355
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:07,576
Okay, look, let me stop you
right there, all right?

356
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,287
You are not responsible for this.

357
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,624
Not in any way, shape or form,
all right?

358
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:18,170
Now, I am very up-to-date on this thing,
probably far more than you are...

359
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,299
...and there are many factors
at play there.

360
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,926
Yeah?

361
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:29,306
For instance, there's some sort of
collision radar on the jet...

362
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,183
...that may not have been working.

363
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,519
That's public record.
You can look that up.

364
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:37,356
And the whole system
is run on 1960s technology.

365
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,816
No.

366
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:44,029
No, really, I blame the government.

367
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:50,703
You either run from things
or you face them, Mr. White.

368
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,790
- What exactly does that mean?
- I learned it in rehab.

369
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:59,545
It's all about accepting
who you really are.

370
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,673
I accept who I am.

371
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,133
And who are you?

372
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,970
I'm the bad guy.

373
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,948
Here's some napkins for you.

374
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,075
Enjoy.

375
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:37,499
- Is the food to your satisfaction?
- Very much.

376
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,210
It's good to see you again.

377
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,466
- May I?
- Please.

378
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:54,600
I have an offer that I think
will be of interest to you.

379
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:01,482
I actually am not here to...

380
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:09,782
I'm here because I owe you
the courtesy and respect...

381
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,534
...to tell you this personally.

382
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,413
I'm done.

383
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,502
It has nothing to do
with you personally.

384
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:24,797
I find you
extraordinarily professional...

385
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,299
...and I appreciate
the way you do business.

386
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:32,971
I'm just making a change in my life,
is what it is.

387
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:38,769
And I'm...
I'm at something of a crossroads...

388
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:44,650
...and it's brought me
to a realization.

389
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,530
I am not a criminal.

390
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,451
No offense to any people who are...

391
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,333
...but this is not me.

392
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,630
I'd like you to hear my offer,
notwithstanding.

393
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,843
It won't change my mind, I'm sorry.

394
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:15,305
Three million dollars
for three months of your time.

395
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,436
Three months, then out.

396
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,319
Three million?

397
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:34,700
May I take this as a "yes"?

398
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:48,130
I have money. I have more money
than I know how to spend.

399
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:52,885
What I don't have is my family.

400
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:57,181
The answer is still no.

401
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,230
Enjoy your meal.

402
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,821
Thank you.

403
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,147
That's it!

404
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,191
Did you feel it?

405
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,860
Texas!

406
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:54,279
I've made this trip three times...

407
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,407
...and every time
there's three big bumps...

408
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,201
...and that's how you know!

409
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,787
We are officially in Texas!

410
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:11,129
This time I got a job waiting for me.

411
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:15,425
I got a cousin who's got a body shop.

412
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,052
Yo, that's for me, homes!

413
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:22,182
They call me "Olive Oil" because
I paint them slick.

414
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:28,063
I do pearlescent, color-shift,
you name it.

415
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,817
I painted cars for some of...

416
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:34,319
...the biggest gangsters in Michoacán.

417
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,699
Wow, those are beautiful boots!

418
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:43,120
Not much good for working, but...

419
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:46,748
Hey, what's on the toes there?
Little silver...

420
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,115
What the hell's going on in there?
