1
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:15,181
Yo, I thought I was gonna see
some, like, vaginas.

2
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,355
I didn't say
she actually painted vaginas.

3
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:29,195
I said, some of her paintings
looked like vaginas.

4
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,700
Seriously? Not even close.

5
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:38,788
Georgia O'Keeffe painted
all kinds of stuff.

6
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:42,500
Everyday items, her surroundings.

7
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:48,131
Some of it evoked an erotic nature.

8
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,134
It's who she was.

9
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:55,388
Not like any vagina I ever saw.

10
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,515
This chick have medical issues?

11
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,935
This particular painting...

12
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:03,020
...is of a door.

13
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,900
Any other doors we can check out?

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,903
Like, real ones or?

15
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,450
You know, I don't get it.

16
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,578
Why would anyone
paint a picture of a door...

17
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:22,081
...over and over again,
like, dozens of times?

18
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,835
- But it wasn't the same.
- Yeah, it was.

19
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,713
It was the same subject,
but different every time.

20
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,466
The light was different,
her mood was different.

21
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,218
She saw something new
every time she painted it.

22
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,388
And that's not psycho to you?

23
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,683
Well, then why should we do anything
more than once?

24
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,394
Should I just smoke
this one cigarette?

25
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:47,148
Maybe we should only have sex once,
if it's the same thing.

26
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:51,068
- Whoa, no.
- Should we just watch one sunset?

27
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,363
Or live just one day?

28
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,159
It's new every time.
Each time is a different experience.

29
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,745
Okay, fine.

30
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:06,626
I guess the cow skull pictures
were cool, but a door?

31
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:11,672
I will say it again. A door.

32
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,219
Why not a door? Sometimes
you get fixated on something...

33
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,679
...and you might not even get why.

34
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,390
You open yourself up
and go with the flow...

35
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,185
...wherever the universe takes you.

36
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:29,065
Okay, so the universe
took her to a door.

37
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:34,153
And she got all obsessed with it
and just had to paint it 20 times...

38
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,072
...until it was perfect.

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,491
I wouldn't say that. Nothing's perfect.

40
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,911
Yeah? Well...

41
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,455
...I mean...

42
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,083
...some things.

43
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:05,017
That was so sweet,
I think I threw up in my mouth a bit.

44
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,063
You can't admit, just for once,
that I'm right.

45
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:13,609
Come on. That O'Keeffe lady
kept trying over and over...

46
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,029
...until that stupid door was perfect.

47
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,242
No. That door was her home
and she loved it.

48
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:25,371
To me,
that's about making that feeling last.

49
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,700
All right, here we go. You ready?

50
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,873
Come on, give me a step.
Give me one step.

51
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,381
Nope. Nope, that's it. Take me up.

52
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,008
You can do this, Hank.

53
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:23,638
Come on, it's supposed to hurt.
Pain is weakness leaving your body.

54
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,806
Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.

55
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,101
- If you can get your leg up, go for it.
- Take me up.

56
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,647
Coffee break. We're gonna let you rest
and then try again.

57
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,692
Never mind about your coffee break.
Take me up. I'm done. I'm done.

58
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,239
- We'll just pick up where we left off.
- Come on, Hank.

59
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,534
You can do it. How else
are you gonna get out of here?

60
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,205
Don't you have any friends?
I mean, Jesus, find something to do.

61
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:53,417
I don't need everyone staring at me
hanging here like a camel's ball sack.

62
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,170
Hank, he just wants to be supportive.

63
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,297
It's all right.

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,137
I'll be right back, okay?
Be right back.

65
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,225
Gonna get me out of here
sometime today?

66
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,062
Sky?

67
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:20,653
We got our first bill,
and, you know, if you're still insistent...

68
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,613
I am.

69
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,122
Prepare yourself.

70
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,798
They're gonna start coming in weekly
like that, so...

71
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,011
You're sure you can do this?

72
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,973
Yeah.

73
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,219
I'll do that.

74
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,558
What the hell, man?

75
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,811
What, I can't work a scale now?

76
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,024
This is bullshit. Just say it.

77
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,609
Just say the words.

78
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,070
You think I'm stealing.

79
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,462
Walk with who you are.

80
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,673
That was the phrase my sponsor
used to use with me...

81
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,510
...back when I first started
coming to meetings.

82
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,597
It's probably just a different way
of saying be yourself, right?

83
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:17,436
But this idea of "walk" also tells me...

84
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,732
...that I have to move forward.
Always good advice, at least for me.

85
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,654
I see we have some new people here
at Group, a couple new faces.

86
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:30,699
See some hands? First time?

87
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,126
Great. Welcome.

88
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,795
Maybe we can go around,
introduce ourselves.

89
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,089
Say whatever's on your mind.

90
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,008
How about you?
You wanna start us off?

91
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,390
Yeah. My name is Andrea...

92
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,856
We don't bite. No judgments.

93
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,276
You can be as open and honest
as you wanna be.

94
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,614
Honestly? I don't wanna be here.

95
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,496
All right, fair enough.
Who else had their hand up?

96
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,004
Hey, what's up?

97
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,339
My name's Jesse.

98
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,635
Well, hello. My name's Brandon.

99
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,889
And this is, I believe, Peter?

100
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,933
Right, I'm Peter. How are you?

101
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,361
Look, I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

102
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,989
It's gonna get slower
smuggling product...

103
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,742
...with Grandpa Anus
watching every move I make.

104
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,870
But don't worry, I'll keep it flowing.

105
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,414
- Great, right on.
- Yeah.

106
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,792
So how's it selling?

107
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,461
Mad volume?

108
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,255
Yeah, it's...

109
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,883
You know, it's...

110
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,469
It's not so good.

111
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,223
What do you mean?
How much have you sold?

112
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,683
I sold a teenth.

113
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:24,146
- One teenth? That's it?
- Yeah.

114
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,439
To who?

115
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,858
To him.

116
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:33,781
It's not easy selling to these people.
They're trying to better themselves.

117
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,451
Yeah, there's, like, positivity and stuff
going on here.

118
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,080
I'm out risking my ass
to get product for you two...

119
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,041
...and you're too pussy to sell?

120
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,002
You're pathetic.

121
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,589
You know what? I want it back.
All of it.

122
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,134
- I'll sell it myself.
- Come on, man. Don't be like that.

123
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,930
Selling to these people,
it's like shooting a baby in the face.

124
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,349
It's not so easy like you think.

125
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:05,479
I will show you
exactly how easy it is.

126
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,943
- Thank you.
- All right.

127
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,028
See you next week.

128
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,667
- Oh, hey, sorry.
- No, go ahead.

129
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,295
Andrea, right?

130
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,007
- Yeah.
- Hey, my name's Jesse...

131
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:38,137
...and I don't really
wanna be here either.

132
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,018
Sorry.

133
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,917
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?

134
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,836
No.

135
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,380
Your dad is.

136
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,888
How'd you get her to sleep so quick?

137
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,140
Are you that boring?

138
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,976
I'm comforting.

139
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,730
I'm a comforting presence.

140
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,742
Hey, so check it out.

141
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,119
See what that means?

142
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,329
Check out the date.

143
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:51,043
Next Thursday is officially six months
that I've had my learner's.

144
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:57,299
Which means I can get my provisional
and start driving by myself.

145
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,969
You don't turn 16
for two more months.

146
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,597
It doesn't matter, it's a provisional.

147
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,725
Look it up. They changed the law
like, 10 years ago.

148
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,811
Yeah, well, I didn't vote for that.

149
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,231
Doesn't matter if you voted for it,
it's the law.

150
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:16,610
So both of you start thinking about
what kind of car you wanna buy me.

151
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:21,490
I think I'd be good
with either an old IROC or a 'Stang.

152
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,035
A 'Stang.

153
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,497
How about something
with playing cards in the spokes?

154
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,792
Makes a nice motory sound,
you know?

155
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,005
Dad, you're not gonna
get off that easy.

156
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,176
Well, I think that this is...

157
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,847
We should probably
table this discussion for later.

158
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,642
Your dad and I have a couple things
we need to talk about, so...

159
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,561
Okay.

160
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,107
A 1971 Mach 1 fastback...

161
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:59,862
...in Grabber Lime
with a shaker hood.

162
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,405
'Stang.

163
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:06,952
I'll write that down so we don't forget.
Oh, darn it, no pencil.

164
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,147
What is
"Ice Station Zebra Associates"?

165
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,110
It's a loan out, it's fine.

166
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,279
Whose loan out?

167
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,157
It's fine. Really.

168
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,826
I...

169
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,578
...have a guy.

170
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,414
Okay.

171
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,668
Does your guy know the tax code
and regulations in New Mexico?

172
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,964
There's very specific paperwork that
has to be submitted quarterly on this.

173
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,926
Yes. My guy is a top...

174
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,802
...guy.
- Who is he?

175
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,555
What's his name?
What are his qualifications?

176
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:14,144
Walt, this money
has to be unimpeachable...

177
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,813
...when it reaches Hank and Marie.

178
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,399
And it is. It will be.

179
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,779
But how do I know that? I mean,
you can't even tell me the man's name.

180
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:27,241
Jesus, Skyler,
do you really wanna know?

181
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,992
Do you really wanna know?

182
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,748
Really?

183
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,118
What a pleasure it is to have you.

184
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,663
I'm gonna call you Skyler,
if that's okay. It's a lovely name.

185
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,208
Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.

186
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:23,046
Walt never told me how lucky he was...
Prior to recent unfortunate events.

187
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,300
His taste in women
is the same as his taste in lawyers...

188
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:30,095
...only the very best
with just the right amount of dirty.

189
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:36,059
That's a joke. That's a joke.

190
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,854
It's funny because you are so clearly
very classy.

191
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,607
Here, please, sit down.

192
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:47,112
So Walt tells me that you have
some concerns I can alleviate.

193
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,573
Yes, I do. I have...

194
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,534
...concerns.

195
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,203
If we're going to go down this road...

196
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,457
...and clearly we are
for the sake of my brother-in-law...

197
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,753
I've heard about him.
He's an American hero.

198
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,091
At any rate, I need some assurances
that we're gonna go about this...

199
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,762
...in a manner that is extremely safe
and cautious.

200
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,890
Fair enough.
I'll walk you through the process.

201
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:19,394
First step is something we like to call
money laundering, all right?

202
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,523
Take your money, represented by,
say, these jelly beans...

203
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,234
You know, I'm a bookkeeper,
so I actually...

204
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,612
I know what money laundering is.

205
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,324
- Well.
- Yeah.

206
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,370
And as with most things,
the devil is in the details.

207
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,957
So to begin with, what are we saying
is the source of this money?

208
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,709
That's simple.

209
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:47,130
Walt here, actually came up with
a great story about gambling winnings.

210
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,716
Blackjack, right?
Some card-counting system?

211
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,302
Well, actually that was Skyler's idea.

212
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:57,474
Well, you grow more gorgeous
by the minute.

213
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,142
There you have it.

214
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,522
I'll generate false Currency Transaction
Reports out the wazoo...

215
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,235
...as well as the necessary W-2Gs.
I know a couple casino managers...

216
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,405
...who will jump at the chance
to report false losses.

217
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,115
It's a win-win for everyone.

218
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,951
Yeah, but you can't sell that
for very long...

219
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,704
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way ahead of you.

220
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,540
We declare just enough
not to arouse suspicion...

221
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:26,586
...then Walt's onetime winnings
become seed money for an investment.

222
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,630
Investment in what?

223
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,632
Drum roll, please. Wait for it.

224
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,926
Laser tag.

225
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,973
Laser tag. Seven thousand square feet
of rollicking fun...

226
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,642
...in the heart
of northern Bernalillo County.

227
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,687
Laser tag?

228
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:48,024
Yeah, there's guns and glow lights,
and kids wear the vests...

229
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,069
Yeah, no, no. I actually...
I know what it is.

230
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,322
It's just that in relation to Walt, it's...

231
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,534
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

232
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,288
Makes more sense
than you two being together.

233
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:05,709
Do you even know Walt?
I mean, how would he, of all people...

234
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:09,629
...buy a laser tag business?
It doesn't add up.

235
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:14,050
It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist,
scientists love lasers.

236
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,470
Plus, they got bumper boats, so...

237
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,013
"Hey, everybody...

238
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:23,143
...Walt suddenly decided to invest
in laser tag. Just out of the blue."

239
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:27,898
Really? That's what we're supposed
to tell people, our family, our friends...

240
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,483
...the government?

241
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,487
Let me bottom line this for you.
You don't need to be involved, okay?

242
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,031
I've been doing this
for a lot of years...

243
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,117
...successfully, believe it or not,
without your help.

244
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,456
So thank you for stopping by.

245
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,309
You want a beer or something?

246
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,062
Or something?

247
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,022
What do you mean?

248
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,275
Like, beer.

249
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,028
I'm cleaned out of anything else.

250
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:21,034
Even if I wasn't,
we're not supposed to.

251
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,203
Yeah.

252
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:30,126
I've heard it over and over
and over again.

253
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,631
You know,
don't you think it's ridiculous...

254
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,510
...that society says beer is okay...

255
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:43,390
...and a little hit of something sweet
is wrong?

256
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:48,854
I mean, what's the point
of shutting yourself off completely...

257
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,732
...from something
that lifts you off the ground?

258
00:19:55,403 --> 00:20:02,701
I spend so much energy
fighting the urge not to use...

259
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,329
...and I feel like crap because of it.

260
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:13,670
- I know, it's just...
- What?

261
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,092
I can't get caught using again.

262
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,181
See, the thing is...

263
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,853
...not to get caught.

264
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,400
You ever try that blue stuff
that's going around?

265
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:41,698
Just a little gas in the tank...

266
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:46,953
...and suddenly
everything is interesting.

267
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,417
Man, I wish
I could make that feeling last.

268
00:20:56,464 --> 00:21:00,091
Like I said, I got nothing here.

269
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,056
What if I could get some?

270
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,231
- Mommy, Mommy.
- Hey, baby.

271
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,443
Your nana brought you home early.

272
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,365
Grandma, I thought
you were keeping Brock today?

273
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,576
I was, then I saw your car.

274
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,789
- I thought you had a meeting.
- I did, but we changed the time.

275
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,125
Grandma, this is Jesse.
He's from the meeting.

276
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,380
He's like a sponsor.
Jesse, this is Grandma.

277
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,190
Jesse, this is Brock.

278
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,362
So you have a kid, huh?

279
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,030
What's up?

280
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,491
Brock, huh?

281
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,202
That's a cool name.

282
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,998
Here, give it up.

283
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:27,512
Brock is almost 6.
You okay, with kids?

284
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,640
What? Yeah. Yeah, he's cool.

285
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,937
Okay, Brock is gonna go play
in his room while the big people talk.

286
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,149
He's gonna go play with his Legos
and his cars.

287
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,234
- Say, "Bye, Jesse."
- Bye, Jesse.

288
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,904
Hope you had a good time
at Grandma's.

289
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,407
Oh, I fixed your blue car,
do you remember?

290
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,742
The convertible one?

291
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,620
You can jump on your bed.
Play with your toys.

292
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:57,751
Safe and cautious, that's all I'm asking,
and that man...

293
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,461
...is neither.

294
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,798
I'll admit
he comes across like a circus clown...

295
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,884
...but he knows what he's doing.

296
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,554
And safe and cautious
is you not being involved in this at all.

297
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,765
Well, it's a little late on that.

298
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,852
This is what happens when you decide
to pay our bills with drug money.

299
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,525
Skyler...

300
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,529
...this isn't just about
what happened before.

301
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:33,495
My involvement in this is ongoing.

302
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,456
Understand?

303
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,501
I can't just quit.

304
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:45,048
I have something of a contract.

305
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:48,218
But it's all very safe, professional.

306
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,428
Structured.

307
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,348
Like, I can't simply quit.

308
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,109
Where you going?

309
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,585
If you're gonna launder money,
Walt...

310
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,630
...at least do it right.

311
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,276
You worked here four years.

312
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,570
It's a business you understand.

313
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,989
It's a story people will believe.

314
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,491
Not laser tag, this.

315
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,786
This is what we buy.

316
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,080
You.

317
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,417
This is what you buy.

318
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:28,818
Yeah, I mean, there's free doughnuts.
Nothing's wrong with a free doughnut.

319
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:36,659
Hey, Jesse, right?

320
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,787
Brandon, Peter.
How goes it? Hanging in there?

321
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,998
Can we please, just?

322
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,291
Dumb-ass.

323
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:47,003
Sorry, man.
I was trying to keep it on the DL.

324
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:51,257
So you and that girl, do the deed yet?

325
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,218
Do what?

326
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,930
You know, sell to her?

327
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,600
What are you two even doing here?

328
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,603
What do you mean?

329
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:08,233
You can't get your nut up to sell,
what's the point of even coming?

330
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,069
Homey, I'm on, like, step five.

331
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,488
Deuce, yo. I'm catching up.

332
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,705
Whatever. Later.

333
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,961
Hey.

334
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,838
Dude needs to come into the fold.

335
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,007
Yup.

336
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,472
Hey, you know what?
I have magical powers.

337
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,182
You wanna see?

338
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,936
Ready?

339
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,440
That's not real.

340
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,610
It is real. All right,
do you wanna see something real?

341
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,404
Look at this. Watch this.

342
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,906
Ready?

343
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,914
You like that?

344
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,918
That's science and stuff,
makes it do that.

345
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:12,130
- Do it again.
- Let Jesse eat his dinner, Brock.

346
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,133
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.
Wanna see it again?

347
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,885
Could you do a trick
with firecrackers?

348
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,346
Firecrackers?

349
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:24,225
You know,
I don't have any firecrackers on me.

350
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,687
- Who does tricks with firecrackers?
- Tomas.

351
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:32,150
Tomas does tricks with firecrackers,
huh? Who's Tomas?

352
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,944
- He's my kid brother.
- Yeah?

353
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,821
And we don't talk about him.

354
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,700
Come on, eat your food, Brock.

355
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,080
Can I have a chip?
I'm gonna steal your chip.

356
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,999
Hey, that's mine.

357
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,253
That's it?
That's what you wanna buy?

358
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,214
People will believe it, at least.

359
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,508
I worked here for four years.

360
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,011
"Wax on, wax off," was that you?

361
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,389
Hey, how come you guys
always give air freshener?

362
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,725
I explicitly say, "No air freshener"...

363
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:10,021
...and every time, I drive away
smelling like an Alpine whorehouse.

364
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,525
All due respect, I don't see it.
So I vote no.

365
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,862
It makes a better story
than your laser tag.

366
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,490
Is that you talking or Yoko Ono?

367
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:25,453
She has a point. It makes more sense
that I invest right here.

368
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:29,540
Based on her years of experience
in money laundering, I suppose.

369
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,336
If you're committed enough,
you can make any story work.

370
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:36,339
I once convinced a woman
that I was Kevin Costner...

371
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:39,717
...and it worked because I believed it,
all right?

372
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,053
Has nothing to do with the story.

373
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:46,307
Besides, this dump isn't gonna work
because it doesn't have a Danny.

374
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,767
There's no Danny here.

375
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,896
What in God's name is a Danny?

376
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:56,234
Danny runs the laser tag.
Danny is the guy who had a vision.

377
00:28:56,402 --> 00:29:01,030
Where others saw a dirt lot,
he saw black lights, rubber aliens...

378
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,866
...teenagers running around
with ray guns, right?

379
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,827
Like Bugsy Siegel in the desert.

380
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:09,455
When the stock market took a shit
and Danny got into trouble...

381
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:13,459
...he went searching for exactly
the type of situation we're offering.

382
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:17,630
Danny will look the other way
to keep his dream afloat.

383
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,676
In other words,
Danny can be trusted completely.

384
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:27,432
That guy, the guy with the eyebrows
that won't quit, is he a Danny?

385
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:32,019
You buy this place, all you got
is a big building that squirts water.

386
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,523
You got no Danny here.

387
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:49,078
You wanna stay for dinner?

388
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,872
Yeah.

389
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,957
Thanks.

390
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,460
What time is it?

391
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,046
Early still.

392
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,177
So...

393
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,431
What?

394
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:14,937
Thought maybe if you're holding,
we can do something.

395
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,940
What?

396
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:22,069
You know, that blue stuff
you were talking about.

397
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,114
- Maybe you had a line on some?
- Wait.

398
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,076
What?

399
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,038
Thought you said
the kid is coming home.

400
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,208
Yeah, in a few hours.

401
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,627
And you seriously wanna get high?

402
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,922
I don't know what
you're getting pissed about.

403
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,382
You're the one who brought it up.

404
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,261
Yeah, that was before
I found out you got a kid.

405
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,388
What kind of mother are you?

406
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,932
What?

407
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,019
You heard me. What kind of mom
gets wasted with a kid to take care of?

408
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,568
Nobody can say
I don't take care of my son.

409
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,695
You come in my house
and judge me?

410
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,115
Like you got no responsibilities
so it's okay for you?

411
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,700
What do you know about me?

412
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,537
I take care of my baby.
I'll do anything for him.

413
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,040
The day Brock was born, I swore...

414
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,127
...I won't let what happened to Tomas,
happen to my son.

415
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,923
I'll die first.

416
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,884
Sorry. I...

417
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,554
I just...

418
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:37,061
Look, I'll get out of here if you want.

419
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,146
That's what you wanna do, then go.

420
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,065
It's not what I want.

421
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:45,444
Look, I was out of line
talking about that stuff.

422
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:59,083
We both were.

423
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,212
You're right...

424
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:06,674
...I don't know
what you've been through.

425
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,176
You can tell me if you want.

426
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:16,100
This whole neighborhood's
run by gangs.

427
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:20,438
They run the drugs,
control the streets.

428
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,068
They sort of took Tomas in.

429
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:28,738
No dad around.

430
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,074
Eight years old...

431
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,119
...they got Tomas slinging.

432
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,872
Part of some crew.

433
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,418
Then when he was 10...

434
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:46,839
...for some initiation or something...

435
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,426
...they made him kill somebody.

436
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,600
I heard the rumors.
I didn't believe it at first.

437
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,396
But then I saw him like a week later.

438
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,278
And he told me, yeah, he did it.

439
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,366
They gave Tomas a gun.

440
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,327
Gave him a choice.

441
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:19,413
Him or some dude.

442
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,708
So he did it.

443
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:27,171
Told me all about it
like it was nothing.

444
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,841
Who did he say he killed?

445
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,761
Some dealer.

446
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,140
From some outside crew.

447
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,062
Right around the corner from here,
over off of Central.

448
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:49,151
Just rode up on his bike
and shot him.

449
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,949
Off of Central?

450
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,203
Like over by the train tracks?

451
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,165
When was this?

452
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,627
Few months back.

453
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,008
What else did he tell you?

454
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,725
He shot the guy
right through the neck.

455
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,894
Shot him dead.

456
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:30,234
Just because he was working
the wrong corner.

457
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,117
It won't happen again.

458
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,036
Not to my son.

459
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,514
Guess what.

460
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:06,103
People who say "guess what" and
then actually expect you to guess...

461
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,105
...I hate those people.

462
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,940
Well, I just heard...

463
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:14,862
...about a certain patient
named Schrader-comma-Hank...

464
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,449
...who is going to be released
at the end of this week.

465
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,452
Isn't that fantastic?

466
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,997
They plan on rolling me
out the front door?

467
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,375
Or put me on a greased plank
and slide me out the window?

468
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,169
Hey.

469
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:34,423
I don't care what any damned
insurance company thinks.

470
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,719
- I'm not leaving here till I'm well.
- Hank, this isn't about insurance.

471
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:43,349
I've talked to everybody, they all say
you are healthy enough to go home.

472
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:47,269
- I'm healthy enough, huh? Yeah.
- Hank, you get stronger every day.

473
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,480
You don't need to be in a hospital.

474
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,733
In this condition, yeah, I do.

475
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,820
You'll be just as comfortable at home
as you are here.

476
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,865
- You'll have all the same equipment.
- Same equipment? What's that mean?

477
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:03,953
The equipment that you have here,
that you need. Short-term.

478
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,206
You'll do your PT at home
and it'll be great...

479
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,167
...because you'll be home.

480
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,712
Wait till you see the bedroom.
I had them move the plasma in.

481
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,006
I know that's how
you always wanted it.

482
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,801
You only had to get shot to get it,
right?

483
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:22,346
- I got you a new bed...
- A hospital bed?

484
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,306
Well...

485
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,184
You put a hospital bed
in my bedroom?

486
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,144
Hank...

487
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,896
...you'll be home.

488
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:34,066
You get that out of my house.

489
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,235
You hear me, Marie?

490
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:37,820
Today.

491
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,448
- Hank...
- I leave this hospital...

492
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,452
...when I walk out of here.
You understand?

493
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,206
And not before.

494
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:53,836
What's a Danny?

495
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,838
Danny's an accomplice.

496
00:36:56,006 --> 00:37:00,759
Someone who's in on the scheme,
who knows about laundering...

497
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,387
...who's paid to look the other way.

498
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,642
Now, while I agree with you
that laser tag is a hard sell...

499
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,605
...without a Danny,
the car wash isn't really an option.

500
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:17,026
And he can't get you another Danny
to run the car wash?

501
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,904
Easier said than done.

502
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,365
If we're looking
for someone trustworthy.

503
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,922
What about me?

504
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,760
What about you?

505
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,387
Me.

506
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,307
I'll be the Danny.

507
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,936
No. No, no, Skyler,
that is not a good idea.

508
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,396
I'm capable of managing
a small business.

509
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,231
A legal business, not this.

510
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,858
Who else could we trust?

511
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,069
- No.
- Walt...

512
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,946
...I'm in this.

513
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,115
- And if I'm in it, I'm gonna do it right.
- No.

514
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:09,286
- You are not in this. You are not...
- We're married, how am I not in this?

515
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,956
We are not married, Skyler,
we're divorced.

516
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,675
Right?

517
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:30,849
I never actually got around
to filing the papers.

518
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:39,149
Married couples can't be compelled
to testify against one another.

519
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,570
So there's that.

520
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,515
Jesse. Jesse.

521
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,934
Respirator.

522
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,146
Right.

523
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,001
Yes?

524
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:50,220
Yes, all right. Okay.

525
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,265
Yeah, I'll be there.

526
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,436
What was that?

527
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,523
An invitation.

528
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,087
Walter, you're right on time.

529
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,422
Please, come in.

530
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,391
I hope you like paila marina.

531
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,269
It's a fancy name for fish stew.

532
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:45,317
It sounds like a cliché, but indeed,
it's just like my mother used to make it.

533
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:53,325
Come on. You can help me cook.

534
00:40:54,911 --> 00:41:00,499
This is a Chilean dish that I love...

535
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,168
...but I never get to make it.

536
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,504
Kids won't eat it.

537
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,257
But...

538
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,843
...you know how that is.

539
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,679
Sure.

540
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,976
Do you mind?

541
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,688
Would you slice the garlic?

542
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,483
Very thin.

543
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,827
Why did you invite me here?

544
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,372
We're working together...

545
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,875
...why not break bread together?

546
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,379
Now, the garlic?

547
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:08,400
It always amazes me the way the
senses work in connection to memory.

548
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,904
I mean, this stew is simply
an amalgam of ingredients.

549
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,908
Taken separately, these ingredients
alone don't remind me of anything.

550
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,243
I mean, not very much at all.

551
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:23,832
But in this precise combination,
the smell of this meal...

552
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,336
...instantly, it brings you back
to my childhood.

553
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,795
How is that possible?

554
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,424
Basically, it takes place
in the hippocampus.

555
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,387
Neural connections are formed.

556
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:43,143
The senses make the neurons
express signals...

557
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:48,357
...that go right back to the same part
of the brain as before.

558
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,817
Where memory is stored.

559
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:56,573
It's something called
relational memory.

560
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,204
Don't quote me on that, I'm...

561
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,249
I'm rusty on my biology.

562
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,709
That's very interesting.

563
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,506
Walter...

564
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:15,133
...I would like to help you, if I could.

565
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,179
Help me how?

566
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,891
Well, when I first started out,
I made a lot of mistakes.

567
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,978
More than I care to admit.

568
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,606
I wish I'd had someone
to advise me...

569
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:33,527
...because this life of ours...

570
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:36,530
...it can overwhelm.

571
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,287
You are a wealthy man now.

572
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,832
And one must learn to be rich.

573
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,335
To be poor, anyone can manage.

574
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:56,300
What advice do you have for me?

575
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,680
Never make the same mistake twice.

576
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,223
Hey.

577
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,517
What's up?

578
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,687
You? You Tomas?

579
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,731
I heard you were the man.

580
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,691
Yeah, what you want?

581
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,946
Crystal.

582
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,199
You think you could hook me up?

583
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,119
- Three hundred.
- For a teenth?

584
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,455
Shit, come on, yo.

585
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,791
Three hundred.

586
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,106
Hey, what's up?

587
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,325
Hey, yo.

588
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,639
Bounce.
