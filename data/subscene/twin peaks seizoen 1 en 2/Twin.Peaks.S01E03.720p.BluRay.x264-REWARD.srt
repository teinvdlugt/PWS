1
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:37,156
No, no. No, not in my room,
in here. In here.

2
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,116
Jerry, back from Paris?

3
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,744
Ben, what a nightmare.
Right there, no, no, right there.

4
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,580
What is with you guys?

5
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,749
I've got a sandwich in there,
I want all those bags opened.

6
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,043
We're looking until we find it.

7
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:54,339
Hey, Audrey, Uncle Jerry's back.
Heh.

8
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,092
- Sylvia.
- Benjamin.

9
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,514
Okay, okay. Go on. Goodbye.

10
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:09,897
Brother Ben, this is the best
damn sandwich I ever ate.

11
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,399
It's a baguette, with Brie and butter.

12
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,569
I had four of these damn things
every day I was there.

13
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,945
You got to try this thing.

14
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,533
Here, go ahead, eat it, go ahead.

15
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,118
Go ahead.

16
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,454
Oh, yeah.

17
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,378
Mm.

18
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,007
Mm. Mm!

19
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,721
Mm! This is incredible, Jer.

20
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,686
You know what this reminds us of?
You know who likes this?

21
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,399
It reminds us of Ginny and Jenny's
down by the river.

22
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,487
- Hmm?
- By God, you're right.

23
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,241
Am I right? Am I right? Hmm?

24
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,034
Oh, no wonder.

25
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,792
Mm. Mm!

26
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,961
Mm. Jer.

27
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,297
Outside, outside, outside.

28
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,925
Mm. Oh.

29
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,637
Always a pleasure.

30
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,893
Mm. Incredible. Incredible.

31
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,608
- Mm.
- Jer.

32
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,783
Leland's daughter was murdered
and the Norwegians left.

33
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,619
Did they sign?

34
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,496
Deal's off.

35
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,873
Oh!

36
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:00,507
We had those Vikings by the horns,
what happened?

37
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,177
We're not a hundred percent sure,
they took their translator with them.

38
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,059
Did you say Leland's daughter
was murdered?

39
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,145
Yes.

40
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,650
Ugh, I'm depressed.

41
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,155
I can fix that.

42
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,075
There's a new girl
at One-Eyed Jack's.

43
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,704
Freshly scented
from the perfume counter.

44
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,831
And you, brother Jer,

45
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,377
have a 50-50 chance
of being first in line.

46
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,923
I like those odds.

47
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:47,971
All work and no play
make Ben and Jerry dull boys.

48
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,973
That's right.

49
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,392
Let's jump in the boat.

50
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,622
That's great huckleberry pie,
Mrs. Hayward.

51
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,956
Thank you, James.

52
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,417
Well...

53
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,004
Mrs. Hayward and I
are gonna say good night, James.

54
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,589
Good night, James.

55
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,132
Good night.

56
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,927
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Mom.

57
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,888
Uh, don't worry about the dishes.
I'll clean up.

58
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,186
Are you, uh, coming to church
with us in the morning, Donna?

59
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,687
Yes.

60
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,818
- Nine o'clock sharp.
- Okay.

61
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,198
- Good night, James.
- Good night, sir.

62
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,174
Hi, sailor.

63
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,219
Good evening, Mr. Horne.

64
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,596
Ah, heh-heh.

65
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,393
Now, Ben, we're not gonna go
in the casino first, are we?

66
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:21,064
Jer, I didn't come here to lose my shirt,
I just came to take it off.

67
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,274
Yeah.

68
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,694
- Kim, the Horne brothers are here.
- I'll tell Blackie.

69
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,125
Sweetheart, I'd like to order two drinks.

70
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:44,880
One double Scotch on the rocks
and my brother would like

71
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,132
a double Scotch on the rocks.

72
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,510
That's two double
Scotch on the rocks.

73
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,722
Next stop, rocket science.

74
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,973
Jerry.

75
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,401
Ah.

76
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,114
- Blackie.
- Benjamin.

77
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,575
Mm.

78
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,995
Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

79
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,456
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate

80
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,709
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,

81
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,087
And every fair from fair
sometimes declines,

82
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,424
By chance or nature's
changing course untrimmed

83
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,552
But thy eternal summer
shall not fade,

84
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,014
Nor lose possession
of that fair thou ow'st,

85
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,475
- Nor shall death brag...
- Where's the new girl?

86
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,105
When you really want love,

87
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,650
you'll find it waiting for you.

88
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,784
Heads.

89
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,829
Ah.

90
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,217
Come on.
We'll take care of you, Jerry.

91
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,221
Well...

92
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,021
Donna, I don't think

93
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:10,108
that what we're feeling or doing
is wrong.

94
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,944
Why not?

95
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,323
Because it's the truth.

96
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,409
Because I think it would have
turned out this way anyway.

97
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,828
You do?

98
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,039
Yes.

99
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:28,668
I remember a time in school,
in the hall,

100
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,797
we were suddenly alone
and we looked at each other.

101
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,053
I almost told you I loved you then.

102
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,974
It's true.

103
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,268
It is true, isn't it?

104
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,231
Oh, James.

105
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,776
I guess because of Laura
I couldn't say anything.

106
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,571
- I couldn't even let myself think it.
- Me too.

107
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,870
Are we gonna be together, James?

108
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,165
Are we?

109
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,965
Are we, James?

110
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,621
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

111
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,956
Hello, it's Hawk.

112
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,709
Deputy Hawk,
how is Ronette Pulaski?

113
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,128
Body and spirit are still far apart.

114
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,088
What did you find out
from her parents?

115
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,423
Ronette recently quit her job

116
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,008
at the perfume counter
of Horne's department store.

117
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,052
Everything else is quiet,
except this afternoon

118
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,848
there was a one-armed man
snooping around intensive care.

119
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,933
A one-armed man?

120
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,309
Left.

121
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,019
Did you question him?

122
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:13,481
Negative.
I pursued but he got away.

123
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,900
Maintain an around-the-clock watch
on Ronette

124
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,777
and we'll speak in the morning.

125
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,286
You got it?

126
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,585
Supposed to leave it
in this stupid football.

127
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,964
Is it in there?

128
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,591
Not all of it.

129
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,054
Cash on delivery, Bobby.

130
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,605
He's got a gun.

131
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,404
- Hey, Leo.
- Hey.

132
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,701
Who's that?

133
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,746
Is there someone with you?

134
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,958
Never mind.
Toss it over here, quarterback.

135
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,090
- It's empty.
- Is that right?

136
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,634
Weren't you supposed to leave
something in there for me?

137
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,053
This barely covers
what we paid for.

138
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,307
- Where's the rest?
- Where's the rest of the money?

139
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,268
There's a... There's a problem.

140
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,937
Problem?

141
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,899
Laura had the other half,
in a safe deposit box.

142
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,650
You think you got problems?

143
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,029
We can get it, Leo. Just wait
till everything settles down.

144
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,531
You punks owe me 10 grand.

145
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,660
Leo needs a new pair of shoes.

146
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,996
Okay.

147
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,416
We won't take delivery on the drugs
until you get the cash.

148
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,168
Do I look like a bank?

149
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,295
I appreciate your position.

150
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,506
But this thing with Laura,
how can I anticipate that kind of thing?

151
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,884
Hey, man, Laura was a wild girl.

152
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,511
Tell me about it.

153
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,556
Maybe. Someday.

154
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,768
Take your hand out of your pocket,
Mike.

155
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,771
What is your problem, Leo?

156
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,190
Problem?

157
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,859
You want to know about problems?

158
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,945
Okay.

159
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,197
You're on the road.

160
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,325
Driving back and forth.
Gone for days.

161
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,910
You get back and guess what?

162
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,412
What?

163
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,415
You find out your old lady's
been giving it away.

164
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,418
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

165
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,505
Stepping out in your own
damn bedroom.

166
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,756
That's a problem.

167
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,384
I guess so.

168
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,344
I guess it is.

169
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,224
- Do you know who?
- A man needs a clean house.

170
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,600
Sure, yeah.

171
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,810
So do you know who?

172
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,147
I'll take care of it.

173
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,357
Sure you will, man.

174
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,359
This other thing, hell,
we'll take care of that,

175
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,902
don't you worry about that.

176
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,988
We'll get the cash
and everything will be square.

177
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,124
Go out for a pass.

178
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,583
What?

179
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,921
- Go out for a pass.
- Okay.

180
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,506
- Just...
- Run.

181
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,049
- Just take it easy.
- Run!

182
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,342
- Take it easy.
- Easy.

183
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,802
- Run!
- Take it easy.

184
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,446
Damn it. I'm done, Bobby.

185
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,948
Let's get the hell out of here.

186
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,733
- Ed.
- I'm sorry, honey, I didn't see it there.

187
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,902
You stepped on my drape runner.

188
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,279
Well, honey, it was right out
in the middle of the floor.

189
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,073
You think that's an accident?

190
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,033
I laid those out there myself.

191
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,286
I was up all night working
on that invention.

192
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:05,750
I'm going to have the world's first
100 percent quiet runner.

193
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,503
I'm real sorry, Nadine.

194
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,755
Ed, you make me sick.

195
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,037
That's it.

196
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,457
Exactly 60 feet, six inches.

197
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,334
It's perfect.

198
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,462
What do you think he's up to?

199
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,133
It beats me.

200
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,555
Invitation to love.

201
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,724
Each day brings a new beginning.

202
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:09,772
And every hour holds the promise
of an Invitation to Love.

203
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,151
Right.

204
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,157
Who is it?

205
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,950
Hey, baby, it's the big bad bobcat.

206
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,077
Are you crazy?
What are you doing here?

207
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,164
I just passed Leo, he started
to diesel up out in North Bend.

208
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,457
- We got at least 20 minutes.
- Oh, God.

209
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,709
Where's your car?

210
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,043
Parked in the woods, come on.

211
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,964
Open sesame. Somebody might
see me out here and that'd be worse.

212
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,846
Bobby, you cannot come by here
like this.

213
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,891
We can't see each other for a while.

214
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,442
What the hell happened to you?

215
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,198
Leo Johnson happened to me.

216
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,367
That bastard.

217
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,744
Come here.

218
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:09,081
Bobby, if he finds out about us,
he's gonna kill you.

219
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,667
He'll kill us both.

220
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:24,388
If he ever does this to you again,
I'll kill him.

221
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,892
I mean it.

222
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,479
Bobby.

223
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,164
Cup of coffee.

224
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:10,184
It's not the first time,
it won't be the last,

225
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,020
but I'm in that doghouse again.

226
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,273
What happened this time?

227
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,191
Well, I popped a grease gun,

228
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,611
stepped on a drape runner
and all hell broke loose.

229
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,321
I ran into Nadine
in the hardware store.

230
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,241
That's all she talked about
were those drape runners.

231
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,662
She's got one big bee in her bonnet.

232
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,460
Young Bobby sure gave me
a good one didn't he?

233
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,046
Where do you want these rocks?

234
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,215
Put them right down there
by the doughnuts, deputy.

235
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,967
Anyone for a warm-up?

236
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,678
- Yes.
- You bet. You bet.

237
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,847
- Right over here.
- Thanks, Lucy.

238
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,352
Damn good coffee.

239
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,146
And hot.

240
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,691
Would everyone please take a seat?

241
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,279
Ah.

242
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,665
By way of explaining
what we're about to do,

243
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,792
I am first going to tell you a little bit

244
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,504
about the country called

245
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,340
Tibet.

246
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,304
An extremely spiritual country,

247
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,682
for centuries the leader of Tibet
has been known as the Dalai Lama.

248
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,020
In 1950, Communist China
invaded Tibet

249
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,481
and while leaving
the Dalai Lama nominally in charge,

250
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,941
they in fact seized control
of the entire country.

251
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:44,028
In 1959, after a Tibetan uprising
against the Chinese,

252
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,113
the Dalai Lama was forced
to flee to India

253
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,532
for his life and has lived
in exile ever since.

254
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,328
Following a dream
I had three years ago,

255
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,206
I have become deeply moved
by the plight of the Tibetan people

256
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,875
and filled with a desire to help them.

257
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,628
I also awoke
from the same dream realizing

258
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,090
that I had subconsciously gained
knowledge of a deductive technique,

259
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,134
involving mind-body coordination
operating hand in hand

260
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,011
with the deepest level of intuition.

261
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,933
Sheriff, Deputy Hawk,
if you will please assist me,

262
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,935
I will now demonstrate.

263
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,485
You will recall
on the day of her death

264
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,113
Laura Palmer wrote
the following entry in her diary:

265
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,198
"Nervous about meeting J tonight."

266
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,076
Today, we're going to concentrate
on the J's.

267
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,126
Harry, when I give the word,
would you please read aloud

268
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,378
each of the names
I've written on the blackboard.

269
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,880
- Okey-doke.
- Deputy Hawk, stand over here

270
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,758
and hold this bucket of rocks up
near me where I can get to them.

271
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,094
Would you please
put on the kitchen mittens?

272
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,096
Deputy Andy, move down,

273
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,806
stand by the bottle.

274
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,727
Lucy, take this piece of chalk.

275
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,439
Not too near, Andy.

276
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,483
I'm getting excited.

277
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,610
If I should strike the bottle
after Sheriff Truman

278
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,530
says a particular name, make a check
to the right of that name.

279
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,782
Oh. Sheriff, I almost forgot,
when you say the name,

280
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,327
also briefly state that person's
relationship to Laura Palmer.

281
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,662
Ready?

282
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,038
- Ready.
- Ready.

283
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,798
James Hurley.

284
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,675
Secret boyfriend.

285
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,844
James Hurley.

286
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,269
Josie Packard.
Was instructed in English by Laura.

287
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,730
Josie Packard.

288
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,654
So there's no check
next to either of these names?

289
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,073
That's correct, please continue.

290
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:57,077
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby,
Laura's psychiatrist.

291
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,955
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby.

292
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,085
You did it, you hit it.

293
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,838
Lucy, make a note
that the bottle was struck

294
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,173
but did not break.

295
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,008
- Very important.
- Okay.

296
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,511
Andy, put that bottle back
exactly where it was.

297
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,140
Johnny Horne.

298
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,601
Laura was
his special education tutor.

299
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,561
Johnny Horne.

300
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,111
Norma Jennings.

301
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,281
She helped Laura organize
the Meals on Wheels program.

302
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,283
Norma Jennings.

303
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,663
Shelly Johnson.

304
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,623
Waitress at diner, friend.

305
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,333
Shelly Johnson.

306
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,716
- Sorry, Andy.
- Sweetie?

307
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,926
It didn't hurt.

308
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,680
It didn't hurt a bit.

309
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,057
Where there's no sense,
there's no feeling, Andy.

310
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,732
Cooper.

311
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,068
Tell me.

312
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:17,449
The idea for all this
really came from a dream?

313
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,077
Yes. It did.

314
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:31,463
Uh, Jack with One Eye.

315
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:36,051
Maybe it's the letter I,
but there's no I in Jack.

316
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,804
I think perhaps it means
he only had one eye, Lucy.

317
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,432
Sounds like, uh, Nadine,
Big Ed Hurley's wife.

318
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,226
No, no, no, there's a casino up north
called One-Eyed Jack's,

319
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,103
across the border
on the Canadian side.

320
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,272
That's it, we're gonna go
and check that place out.

321
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,481
Okay.

322
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:53,402
Agent Cooper, I'm going to erase this
because it's a place and not a person.

323
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,946
Actually, maybe the person
could be in the place.

324
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,365
- So should I erase it?
- Yes.

325
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,285
Yes, a person could be in a place,
or yes, I should...?

326
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,288
- Lucy.
- Erase it, Lucy.

327
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,581
Next name, Harry.

328
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,833
Leo Johnson.

329
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:13,005
Husband of Shelly, drives a truck,
connection with Laura...

330
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,967
- Unknown.
- Leo Johnson.

331
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,722
Ah!

332
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,089
Little Audrey Horne just walked in.

333
00:27:56,424 --> 00:28:00,469
Yeah, I saw her at church.
Wonder what she's doing down here.

334
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,697
- Hi, Audrey.
- Hi, Norma.

335
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,783
- Can I have a cup of coffee, please?
- Sure.

336
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,956
Remind me to stop at the hardware
store to get those 60-watt bulbs.

337
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,756
Thanks.

338
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,314
I'm gonna go say hi.

339
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,658
Hi.

340
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,577
Hi, Donna.

341
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,083
So my parents said
they saw you at church today.

342
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,960
I didn't see you.

343
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,423
Yeah, I came by because of Laura.

344
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,801
What do you mean?

345
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,595
I didn't even think you liked her.

346
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,639
There were things about Laura
I didn't like,

347
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,642
but she did help to take care
of my brother Johnny.

348
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,978
Guess I sort of loved her for that.

349
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,661
Do you like coffee?

350
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,791
Yeah. With cream and sugar.

351
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,880
Agent Cooper loves coffee.

352
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,590
Audrey.

353
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,684
But Agent Cooper
likes his coffee black.

354
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,528
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

355
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,867
Did Laura ever talk about my father?

356
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,247
What do you mean?

357
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,792
Nothing.

358
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,545
No, what do you mean?

359
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,342
He used to sing to her.

360
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,016
God, I love this music.

361
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,355
Isn't it too dreamy?

362
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,611
Can you believe this?

363
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:49,448
Hawk found this half mile
down the tracks from the crime site.

364
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,246
Oh, it's a nasty piece of work.

365
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,879
Tell Agent Cooper
that Albert and his team are here.

366
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,798
- Albert?
- A-L-B-E-R-T.

367
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,092
Are we gonna have to
stand here all afternoon?

368
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,803
- No.
- Albert Rosenfield.

369
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,932
R-O-S-E-N-F-l-E-L-D.

370
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,644
Sheriff, this is Lucy.

371
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,187
Is Agent Cooper with you?

372
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,772
Yes, he is.

373
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,316
Are Albert and his team here, Lucy?

374
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,401
Yes, he is. They are.

375
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,111
We're on our way.

376
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,821
Agent Cooper will be right with you.

377
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,990
Yeah, I can hear perfectly well,
Curly.

378
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,703
Harry, Albert and his team
are cream of the crop.

379
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,205
Albert's a forensic genius.

380
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,707
If they're working for you,
I wouldn't expect anything less.

381
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:45,003
But I got to warn you. Albert's
lacking in some of the social niceties.

382
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:48,340
- Nobody's perfect.
- Isn't that the truth?

383
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,683
What the hell kind
of a two-bit operation

384
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,559
they running out of this tree house,
Cooper?

385
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,812
Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.

386
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,022
I have seen
some slipshod backwater burgs,

387
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,482
but this place takes the cake.

388
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,485
What are you waiting for, Christmas?
Got work to do.

389
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,570
They're putting this girl
in the ground tomorrow,

390
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,532
and we've wasted half the day traveling
here to the middle of nowhere.

391
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,201
Well, Albert, I suggest you
and your team should get started.

392
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,787
I'll have one of my men
escort you over to the morgue.

393
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:19,997
That'd be fine.

394
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,000
Results from
the local pathologist's report.

395
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,671
Welcome to amateur hour.

396
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,884
Looks like an all nighter, boys.

397
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,636
Albert.

398
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,555
Got a minute?

399
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,228
I hear that you're real good
at what you do.

400
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,439
- Yeah, that's correct.
- Well, that's good.

401
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:49,526
Because normally if a stranger walked
into my station talking this kind of crap,

402
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:54,072
he'd be looking for his teeth
two blocks up on queer street.

403
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,177
Good night, Ed.

404
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,142
Ed, is that you?

405
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,352
Yeah, honey, it's me.

406
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,941
- Ed!
- Oh, my God.

407
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:38,283
Oh, Ed, I'm so happy, sweetheart,
I have to thank you.

408
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,618
Why's that?

409
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,204
You don't know
what you've done for me?

410
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,663
No, I don't.

411
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,666
Oh, Ed, you big lug.

412
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,795
When you tracked all
that grease into the house today,

413
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:53,590
you spilled some on my cotton balls,

414
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:58,637
but instead of tossing them out,
I put the greased ones on the runners,

415
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:04,309
and, Ed, just listen to this.

416
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,612
Completely silent.

417
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,614
How about that?

418
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,574
Oh, Ed.

419
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,829
We are gonna be so rich.

420
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,007
Everything smells like fish
around here.

421
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:40,178
Well, you could wash your socks
separately.

422
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,641
What did that FBI man
want up here today?

423
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,101
Very nice fellow.

424
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,479
Asked a few questions.

425
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,690
About what?

426
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,860
Oh, he talked to Josie mostly.

427
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:58,530
I had a problem with a fish.

428
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,367
Took a liking to my percolator.

429
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,287
What did he want
to talk to Josie about?

430
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,206
Why don't you ask her?

431
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,924
Here's the key, the ledger's inside.

432
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,218
- Thank you.
- You betcha.

433
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,060
Didn't he want to talk to me?

434
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,897
Yeah, but we told him
you were on your world tour,

435
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,149
he should contact
your press agent.

436
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:39,029
Get your boots off my bed
and go to your room!

437
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,917
I didn't want to get mink oil
on my bedspread.

438
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,091
You got mink oil on your head.

439
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,326
Two books.

440
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,552
Oh.

441
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,830
Leland?

442
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,874
- Leland, stop it.
- We have to dance.

443
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,335
We have to dance, Sarah.
We have to dance.

444
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,878
For Laura.

445
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,213
Oh, Leland, stop it.
Give that to me, give it to me.

446
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,924
- We have to dance.
- Leland, Leland.

447
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,760
Give it to me.

448
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,940
What is going on in this house?

449
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:34,412
Leland, what is going on
in this house?

450
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,292
Oh, God!

451
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,059
Laura.

452
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:43,106
Laura.

453
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:59,831
Through the darkness of future pasts
The magician longs to see

454
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:05,628
One chants out between two worlds

455
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,800
"Fire, walk with me"

456
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,013
We lived among the people.

457
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,934
I think you say, convenience store.

458
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,438
We lived above it.

459
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:28,902
I mean it like it is, like it sounds.

460
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:34,699
I, too, have been touched
by the devilish one.

461
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:38,077
Tattoo on the left shoulder.

462
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:45,752
Ah, but when I saw the face of God,
I was changed.

463
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,422
I took the entire arm off.

464
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,926
My name is Mike.

465
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:56,554
His name is Bob.

466
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,723
Mike?

467
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:03,186
Mike, can you hear me?

468
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:09,943
Catch you with my Death Bag.

469
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:14,239
You may think I've gone insane.

470
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,201
But I promise

471
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:22,580
I will kill again.

472
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,962
But it is Laura Palmer.

473
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,051
Are you Laura Palmer?

474
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,648
Harry, it's Cooper.

475
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,484
Meet me for breakfast, 7 a.m.,
the hotel lobby.

476
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,362
I know who killed Laura Palmer.

477
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:09,784
No, it can wait till morning.
