1
00:02:26,802 --> 00:02:30,723
You're not thinking about
going to work today, are you?

2
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:34,560
Thought I would. That inhaler really
seems to be doing the trick.

3
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:37,813
- What?
- Just take the rest of the week.

4
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:40,733
Please. You've earned it.

5
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:42,651
Don't push it.

6
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,988
Besides, I want you well
for the weekend.

7
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,743
Mom wants to party.

8
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:54,622
It's just a little get-together,
that's all.

9
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,166
Sunday afternoon, maybe?
Nothing too big.

10
00:02:57,374 --> 00:03:00,252
Just family and a few friends.

11
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,714
We've got a lot to celebrate.
Don't you think?

12
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,260
Sounds good.

13
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:21,649
Oh, thank you.

14
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:23,484
Now...

15
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,570
...what are you supposed
to do today?

16
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:30,115
- Nothing.
- Excellent.

17
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:36,580
Brownie points for taking a nap.

18
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,217
Can you meet?

19
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:19,516
I thought maybe you
might have, you know...

20
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:21,185
...kicked.

21
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,729
Signed-- Signed off.

22
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:26,523
I was even checking the obits.

23
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:28,734
No such luck.

24
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:32,780
So where does it stand?

25
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:37,242
Coughing up blood,
giving speeches, you know, like:

26
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:40,329
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."

27
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:42,247
What's the upshot?

28
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:44,583
The upshot.

29
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:51,924
The upshot is that
I have radiation pneumonitis.

30
00:05:55,094 --> 00:05:56,095
Damn.

31
00:05:58,305 --> 00:06:00,683
Actually, it's not
as bad as it sounds.

32
00:06:02,017 --> 00:06:06,271
It's a fairly common occurrence,
easily treated.

33
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:09,108
In fact...

34
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:12,278
...the news is all good.

35
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:15,030
What do you mean, good?

36
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,659
You mean, like, "good" good?

37
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:21,954
What, you mean, like,
remission good?

38
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:28,711
Remission. Not to imply I'm cured.
I still have cancer.

39
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,131
But there's been a significant
reduction in the tumours.

40
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:34,883
How significant?

41
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:37,261
Eighty percent.

42
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:39,638
Dude. No way.

43
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:42,933
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
not by any stretch...

44
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:48,147
...but "options" is the word
they keep bandying about.

45
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:51,317
That's awesome. Serious?

46
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:54,236
That's-- That's great, man.

47
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:57,990
I mean, my aunt, she never--
I mean, you know, at your stage...

48
00:06:58,198 --> 00:07:00,409
...I didn't think that could happen.

49
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:02,077
Yeah.

50
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,788
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

51
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:07,791
No. You must be so psyched.

52
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:10,836
Of course. I am.

53
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:14,423
Okay, now we...

54
00:07:16,383 --> 00:07:18,844
I mean, what do we...?

55
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:22,014
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

56
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,356
So how do you want to...

57
00:07:31,023 --> 00:07:33,609
...you know, proceed...

58
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:36,487
...in light of this kick-ass news?

59
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:43,869
We'll take our time
and stay cautious.

60
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:46,080
Sell off what we have.

61
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:47,915
And then...

62
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:54,713
Well, then I guess...

63
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,549
...I'm done.

64
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,739
- Batter up.
- Everyone?

65
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:24,201
Hey, you guys.
I would like to make a toast...

66
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:29,373
- ...with my non-alcoholic beverage.
- Somebody kill the music.

67
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:33,419
I know one party
can't begin to repay...

68
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:38,841
...all your support
and your many, many kindnesses.

69
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:41,343
But then again...

70
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:46,098
...Hank does make
one mean margarita.

71
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:51,478
We really do want to thank you.

72
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:55,107
These last few months have been...

73
00:08:55,774 --> 00:09:00,446
...wow, a challenging time,
to put it mildly.

74
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:03,115
But I have to say
Walt's come through it like a champ.

75
00:09:03,324 --> 00:09:06,452
- All right.
- Honey, I'm so proud of you.

76
00:09:06,702 --> 00:09:08,329
We all are.

77
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:14,960
Okay, I'm gonna stop
with the sappy stuff. I am.

78
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:17,129
But it's true. It really is.

79
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:20,799
And for the first time
in a long time...

80
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:23,969
...we are so excited about the future.

81
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:28,599
Okay, anyway...

82
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:31,477
...I want to also
express my gratitude...

83
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:36,649
...to two very special people
who couldn't be here today.

84
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:39,818
But they send their regrets
and their warm wishes.

85
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:41,779
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz...

86
00:09:41,987 --> 00:09:44,990
...for those of you
who don't know them, are...

87
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:48,953
Well, they're heroes.

88
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:53,082
They are incredibly generous friends
who made the amazing offer...

89
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,085
...to pay for Walt's treatment.

90
00:09:58,212 --> 00:09:59,838
And they did.

91
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:01,632
So...

92
00:10:02,424 --> 00:10:03,842
...to Gretchen and Elliott.

93
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:07,763
- To Gretchen and Elliot.
- Cheers.

94
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:10,849
Hey, how about the man of the hour?
Come on.

95
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:12,434
- Speech.
- Yes.

96
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:14,144
- Speech.
- Yeah, Dad.

97
00:10:14,353 --> 00:10:16,730
Come on, Walt. Speech.

98
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:20,693
Well, it's...

99
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:22,444
It's kind of funny.

100
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:28,117
When I got my diagnosis, cancer...

101
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:32,496
...I said to myself, you know:

102
00:10:32,746 --> 00:10:33,956
"Why me?"

103
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,710
And then...

104
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:42,214
...the other day,
when I got the good news...

105
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:47,761
...I said the same thing.

106
00:10:57,229 --> 00:10:58,564
Anyway.

107
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:01,775
Thank you for coming.

108
00:11:02,318 --> 00:11:05,571
And enjoy.

109
00:11:06,572 --> 00:11:09,408
- All right, cheers.
- Yeah.

110
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:10,951
Cheers.

111
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:13,370
Inspirational.

112
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:16,832
Tell you what. I gotta give
those bastards points for originality.

113
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,083
I'll tell you that much.

114
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:21,879
A little mercury switch,
9-volt battery...

115
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:26,216
...five or six ounces of C-4,
that's how those cartel boys party.

116
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:29,219
Yeah, but why a turtle?

117
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:32,097
Oh, that's the best part. It was a...

118
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:34,725
It was a... What the hell's the word
I'm looking for?

119
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:38,604
Not a metaphor, not an analogy,
it's a...

120
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:41,315
Walt, what's the word
I'm looking for?

121
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,652
Anyway...

122
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,614
...Tortuga. Okay?
That was the name of our snitch.

123
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:51,116
Bean-speak for tortoise. Okay?

124
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:56,038
Tortoise, turtle, what have you.
I never knew the difference myself.

125
00:11:56,246 --> 00:11:58,624
Hey, top me off there,
will you, buddy?

126
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:00,501
Anyway.

127
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:02,544
Poetic.

128
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:06,757
I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic.
That's the word.

129
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,884
I guess that's the word.

130
00:12:28,946 --> 00:12:29,947
Go ahead.

131
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:36,495
Better not let your mom see.

132
00:12:50,884 --> 00:12:55,848
Oh, yeah, I think I see a hair.
Maybe two.

133
00:12:57,308 --> 00:13:00,185
- There's no worm in this, right?
- No, that would be mescal.

134
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:02,688
Talk about your hangovers, okay?

135
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:05,983
I was down in Glynco, Georgia.
I was back east, doing some training.

136
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:09,570
Had this firearm instructor
who was...

137
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:12,448
He was a good old boy, you know?
Hey. There you go. Thanks.

138
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:16,035
I mean, this guy could put them away
like he had two livers, okay?

139
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:18,871
Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish.

140
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,040
We were drinking mescal stupid.

141
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:23,375
But-- Hey, hey.

142
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,547
Walt, what you doing there?

143
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:30,466
What does it look like I'm doing?

144
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,719
The kid's 16.

145
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:36,347
What are you going for,
Father of the Year?

146
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:40,142
What are you looking at him for?

147
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:49,193
We're celebrating. Come on.

148
00:13:53,405 --> 00:13:54,990
That's all right.

149
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:07,086
No.

150
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,927
Jesus.

151
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:24,645
Listen, I'd take a pass on that one
if I were you, okay?

152
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:28,023
Think we've been bogarting
this puppy long enough.

153
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:30,609
Hey.

154
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:36,365
Bring the bottle back.

155
00:14:39,618 --> 00:14:41,412
Sorry, buddy. No can do.

156
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:45,457
It's my son. My bottle. My house.

157
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:52,339
- It's all right.
- What are you waiting for?

158
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:53,757
Bring it back.

159
00:15:01,557 --> 00:15:03,475
Why don't we just call it a day?

160
00:15:04,768 --> 00:15:06,312
All right, pal?

161
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:12,026
- We good?
- The bottle.

162
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:15,154
Now.

163
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:24,455
What's going on?

164
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:31,295
Jesus.

165
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:37,760
Here, sweetie. Okay. Okay.

166
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:39,637
Oh, my God.

167
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:43,849
Okay. Okay.

168
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:50,397
There you go. Okay. That's it.

169
00:15:50,606 --> 00:15:52,900
Just get it out. That's okay.

170
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:05,329
This is your brain.

171
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:12,044
This is your brain on drugs.

172
00:16:24,014 --> 00:16:25,933
You weren't supposed to wake up.

173
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:28,352
Ever or...?

174
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:34,191
No, I was just thinking
that I'd bring it, you know, in.

175
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:36,902
You want me to go back to bed?

176
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:39,697
No, I guess that'd be kind of--

177
00:16:41,615 --> 00:16:43,242
No.

178
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:47,371
Need some help?

179
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,498
No, I got it.

180
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,794
Just have a seat.

181
00:16:54,086 --> 00:16:55,838
Is there any coffee?

182
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,258
Yeah, shit. One second.

183
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:01,427
Well, at least let me do that.

184
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:04,805
No, I don't want you to have
to do anything, you know?

185
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:16,400
All right. Here.
You take the good one.

186
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:19,612
It's huevos rancheros.

187
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:22,740
- I can tell.
- Yeah?

188
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:27,786
- Fork.
- Oh, yeah.

189
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,006
There you go.

190
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:43,761
So, what are you up to today?
Working?

191
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:47,473
- Whatever that means.
- No.

192
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:52,144
I'm all yours.

193
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,562
Really?

194
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:39,108
<i>Hey, this is Skyler.
Please leave me a message. Thanks.</i>

195
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:42,653
Hi.

196
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:47,116
I just wanted to say that...

197
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:48,534
No.

198
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:52,579
We'll talk tonight...

199
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:56,583
...but I wanted to say that...

200
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,588
...I'm not exactly sure
who that was yesterday...

201
00:19:01,797 --> 00:19:03,716
...but it wasn't me.

202
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:08,095
And I'm sorry.

203
00:19:10,597 --> 00:19:12,099
Love you.

204
00:19:43,297 --> 00:19:45,090
Oh, boy.

205
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,029
<i>I just wanted to say that...</i>

206
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:08,447
<i>No.</i>

207
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:13,369
<i>We'll talk tonight,
but I wanted to say that...</i>

208
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:14,954
Hey there.

209
00:20:15,162 --> 00:20:19,083
- Wow, who brought the churros?
- That would be me.

210
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,753
If I leave them at home, I'll just
wind up eating them all myself, so...

211
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:28,968
They're actually-- They're leftovers.
We had a little get-together for Walt.

212
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:31,095
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

213
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:34,181
Actually...

214
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,016
...Walt's got...

215
00:20:38,352 --> 00:20:42,147
He's been battling cancer.

216
00:20:42,898 --> 00:20:45,859
- Skyler--
- And last week we got good news.

217
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:50,197
- I'm so sorry.
- But we're really optimistic.

218
00:20:50,406 --> 00:20:51,740
Great.

219
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:54,576
- Great. Good news is great.
- Yeah.

220
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:57,246
Yeah, it is. It really is.

221
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,918
Well...

222
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:06,005
...feel free to bring these any time.

223
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:07,756
Yeah.

224
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,186
Got some real beauts.

225
00:21:24,064 --> 00:21:27,985
You cannot beat
the thermal efficiency of the C3.

226
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:29,737
Yeah?

227
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:33,866
Then again, what about tankless?

228
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:37,202
Sure. We got them.

229
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:40,039
The good ones will
really run up your price though.

230
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:43,334
Set you back about 1200.

231
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:46,754
It's not an issue.

232
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:50,841
You want installation, right?

233
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:55,679
- No. I'm gonna do it myself.
- That's what I like to hear.

234
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:10,444
And who's this?
This guy can surf without a board?

235
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:13,697
That's Hover Man.

236
00:22:13,906 --> 00:22:16,784
He can surf, skate, glide...

237
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:21,538
...whatever, because he's always got
a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

238
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:24,249
That's cool. Great lines.

239
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,048
And this guy?
What's his superpower?

240
00:22:31,757 --> 00:22:34,259
That's Kanga-man.

241
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:37,054
Kanga-man?
Half-man, half-kangaroo?

242
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,558
- And who's this in his pouch?
- His sidekick, Joey.

243
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:45,354
He rides around in his pouch
and, you know...

244
00:22:45,813 --> 00:22:47,147
...fights crime.

245
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:50,317
So that makes Kanga-man a she.

246
00:22:51,193 --> 00:22:52,945
You know that, right?

247
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,739
Only female kangaroos
have pouches.

248
00:22:55,948 --> 00:22:57,408
Yeah, yeah, I know.

249
00:22:57,616 --> 00:23:00,077
But, you know, it's definitely a dude.

250
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:02,579
He's a product of experimentation.

251
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:05,749
He's kind of hot, I guess.
Nice haunches.

252
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:12,339
- And this is?
- It's Backwardo.

253
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:16,260
Wait, no. I actually--
I changed it to Rewindo.

254
00:23:16,468 --> 00:23:18,554
Anyways, he goes backwards.

255
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:20,431
He can make everything
go in reverse.

256
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:22,683
Time and stuff? Like time travelling?

257
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:25,436
No, he just walks backwards.

258
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:28,439
He walks backwards?

259
00:23:28,814 --> 00:23:31,817
Is that a superpower?
What good is that?

260
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:34,403
No, I mean, he does it,
like, really fast.

261
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:37,531
Okay, look, say someone's
coming at him with a knife, right?

262
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,035
I mean, it's helpful. Then he can just
zip backwards away from them.

263
00:23:41,243 --> 00:23:42,911
Okay.

264
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,623
Yo, I was a kid...

265
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:47,374
...when I drew all these.

266
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,127
It was like four years ago.

267
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:54,089
- They all look like you.
- What?

268
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,134
It's you in all of these.

269
00:23:57,885 --> 00:23:59,470
No.

270
00:23:59,678 --> 00:24:02,681
I wonder what a shrink would say
if he saw them.

271
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,059
Oh, shut up.

272
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:07,311
Like you never wanted
a superpower.

273
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:19,073
- Is that your door or mine?
- I don't know.

274
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:22,284
It sounds like mine.

275
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:32,503
- I gotta go.
- Where?

276
00:24:34,046 --> 00:24:36,674
Hey, where?

277
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:41,845
Hey, hold up. Where are you...?

278
00:24:51,355 --> 00:24:52,815
Jane.

279
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:06,245
Jane.

280
00:25:19,717 --> 00:25:22,011
- Hey, Dad.
- There you are.

281
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:24,471
Hi, honey.

282
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,641
I saw your car, so I was
pretty sure you were home.

283
00:25:27,975 --> 00:25:30,978
Yeah, sorry. I was working.
I had my headphones on.

284
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:33,397
Finally realised that
I wasn't the drum track?

285
00:25:34,773 --> 00:25:37,151
- Exactly.
- Well, I was in the neighbourhood.

286
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,112
Was wondering if you wanted
to grab some lunch.

287
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:41,572
Sure. Yeah.

288
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:46,493
Hey, this your dad?

289
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,455
- Yes.
- Hello.

290
00:25:49,663 --> 00:25:50,914
Hi.

291
00:25:51,123 --> 00:25:52,833
This is the new tenant.

292
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,669
- Donald.
- Jesse.

293
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:01,342
I'm sorry. Did you need something?

294
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:07,097
- No.
- Dad, why don't you come in?

295
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:08,891
It was nice seeing you.

296
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:12,061
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

297
00:26:42,675 --> 00:26:44,134
Hey, Dad.

298
00:26:45,427 --> 00:26:49,306
- Hey, son. Are you home early?
- No.

299
00:26:50,516 --> 00:26:52,142
Oh, man.

300
00:26:53,435 --> 00:26:55,771
It was a good day?

301
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:59,984
Now it is. Finally, hot water.
No more toxic waste.

302
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:02,194
Yes. Yes, indeed.

303
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:05,906
Top of the line, on demand,
unlimited supply.

304
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:07,491
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

305
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,787
- Hey, want to take her for a spin?
- Oh, yeah.

306
00:27:12,454 --> 00:27:14,665
Listen, why don't you
go to the kitchen sink?

307
00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:18,085
Let me know when you're ready,
and I'll give you a holler.

308
00:27:18,294 --> 00:27:19,878
Okay.

309
00:27:20,921 --> 00:27:23,841
Pilot in.

310
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:26,719
Ignition. Bingo.

311
00:27:26,927 --> 00:27:28,512
Okay.

312
00:27:29,138 --> 00:27:32,099
- Ready.
- All right. Let her rip.

313
00:27:40,107 --> 00:27:42,192
Hundred and seventeen
thousand BTUs.

314
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:44,403
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

315
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:47,031
Built-in corrosion-resistant
draught reducer...

316
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:49,700
...safety thermocouple
with the pilot burner.

317
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:51,994
Sounds really good, Dad.

318
00:27:52,578 --> 00:27:54,371
And the energy savings. I mean...

319
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,707
Oh, careful, careful, careful.

320
00:27:56,915 --> 00:27:59,710
There's probably some adjustments
I need to make. You okay?

321
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:02,546
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay.

322
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,259
Son...

323
00:28:08,135 --> 00:28:11,889
- ...about yesterday--
- I'm sorry about the pool.

324
00:28:13,432 --> 00:28:17,394
No, no, no, that was not your fault.
Not at all.

325
00:28:18,854 --> 00:28:20,314
See, your...

326
00:28:20,898 --> 00:28:23,108
Your old man embarrassed himself...

327
00:28:23,317 --> 00:28:25,569
...and I'm not very proud
of my behaviour.

328
00:28:25,778 --> 00:28:29,573
I have to say I feel very foolish.

329
00:28:32,284 --> 00:28:36,288
You and Uncle Hank,
you seemed pissed off.

330
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:39,833
No. No. We're fine.
Everything's fine.

331
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:43,921
I called him this morning
and made my apologies.

332
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,427
But, son, I owe you
an apology most of all.

333
00:28:51,345 --> 00:28:54,306
I should have used
better judgment all around.

334
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:58,519
Having you drink in the first place,
it was not right...

335
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:00,896
...and for that I'm very sorry.

336
00:29:01,563 --> 00:29:03,357
But I kept up, right?

337
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:09,446
You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.

338
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:19,039
I have some tools to put away.

339
00:30:21,226 --> 00:30:22,603
Hey.

340
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,981
Yo.

341
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,359
You want to catch a movie later?

342
00:30:31,737 --> 00:30:33,238
Yo.

343
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:37,826
- What?
- What was that all about?

344
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:40,120
What?

345
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:42,748
Before. With your dad.

346
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:45,501
It wasn't about anything.

347
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:50,756
Oh, okay, so I totally
just misread your total dis?

348
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,217
If anything, I was doing you a favour.

349
00:30:53,425 --> 00:30:55,010
A favour?

350
00:30:55,678 --> 00:30:57,930
Yeah, I told you. He's a hard-ass.

351
00:30:58,138 --> 00:31:00,849
- He seemed cool to me.
- Yeah, well.

352
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:04,395
- So, what's the deal?
- There's no deal.

353
00:31:04,603 --> 00:31:07,940
I was helping you out, okay?
Protecting you.

354
00:31:09,108 --> 00:31:10,693
- How's that?
- I mean...

355
00:31:12,194 --> 00:31:14,989
...I'm letting you smoke in here
and everything.

356
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:17,241
I bought a filter.

357
00:31:17,449 --> 00:31:19,827
And I figured
the less he knows, the better.

358
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:23,080
You acted like
you didn't even know me.

359
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:24,748
So?

360
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:28,419
- So?
- You think I'm gonna be all like:

361
00:31:28,627 --> 00:31:30,671
"Dad, meet the stoner guy
who lives next door.

362
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:33,340
And by the way,
I'm sleeping with him"?

363
00:31:34,508 --> 00:31:36,093
That's all you think you're doing?

364
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:38,929
- Why do you even care about my dad?
- I don't.

365
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:41,432
Good. Then I don't know
why we're talking about it.

366
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,269
Us. All right? I'm talking about us.

367
00:31:45,477 --> 00:31:47,896
- Us.
- Yeah.

368
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:50,107
You and me.

369
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:54,111
Who's you and me?

370
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:03,621
I'm out of here.

371
00:33:45,514 --> 00:33:46,974
Oh, boy.

372
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:58,694
Dad?

373
00:34:04,074 --> 00:34:06,493
Dad? Hello?

374
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,912
What? Oh, hey.

375
00:34:10,456 --> 00:34:13,042
- What are you doing?
- We've got rot.

376
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,878
- Rot?
- Yeah. Here.

377
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:18,505
I'll show you. Here.

378
00:34:18,714 --> 00:34:19,757
Take a look at that.

379
00:34:22,217 --> 00:34:25,220
See that? Yeah.
Ever seen anything like it?

380
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:29,183
- It's wood.
- It's wood...

381
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:31,101
...that contains fruiting bodies.

382
00:34:31,977 --> 00:34:33,020
Fruity what?

383
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,482
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.

384
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,734
I don't really see anything.

385
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:42,404
Yeah, well, it's there. You just have
to know where to look. Here.

386
00:34:43,155 --> 00:34:45,240
Then you cut it all out.

387
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:47,868
You just cut it out and start fresh.

388
00:34:48,994 --> 00:34:51,664
Well, better get to it.

389
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:54,959
Is the whole house
gonna collapse or something?

390
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:57,628
Not if I can help it.

391
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:27,658
Hey. You bucking for a promotion?

392
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,745
- Go home already.
- I will. I will.

393
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,500
Hey, can I just ask...

394
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:40,212
- ...the Keller account?
- The Keller account?

395
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:44,091
It's listed as a current asset
on this balance sheet...

396
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,345
...but the invoice was never presented
to accounts receivable, so...

397
00:35:48,554 --> 00:35:49,596
Oh, God.

398
00:35:49,805 --> 00:35:53,017
One of these days I'm gonna just
sort through all the Dad stuff.

399
00:35:53,225 --> 00:35:56,520
He had so many "Don't worry about it,
pay me Friday" relationships...

400
00:35:56,729 --> 00:35:58,731
...with these little companies.

401
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:02,526
We'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not.

402
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,029
Right.

403
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:08,741
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me lock you in, are you?

404
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:10,909
Sky?

405
00:36:13,078 --> 00:36:14,163
Skyler?

406
00:36:15,331 --> 00:36:17,041
Jesus.

407
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:21,503
No, I'm fine.

408
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:26,800
It's hormones. Honestly.
It happens all the time.

409
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,845
I'll see you tomorrow.

410
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:38,395
What's wrong?

411
00:36:42,024 --> 00:36:43,859
I guess it just...

412
00:36:46,612 --> 00:36:50,074
...doesn't feel any different.

413
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,581
The good news?

414
00:36:58,832 --> 00:37:02,920
I mean, nothing's really changed.

415
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:06,757
It's just postponed.

416
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:11,762
There was supposed to be a light
at the end of the tunnel.

417
00:37:16,141 --> 00:37:18,435
But lately, it just feels like...

418
00:37:20,396 --> 00:37:22,022
More tunnel.

419
00:37:22,523 --> 00:37:24,275
I'm sorry.

420
00:37:30,322 --> 00:37:33,033
I just feel so damn ungrateful.

421
00:37:33,826 --> 00:37:35,828
I don't know.

422
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:38,414
For me, it was the flu.

423
00:37:38,998 --> 00:37:42,293
- What?
- My dad rallied at the end.

424
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:44,878
I mean, it wasn't the full-on
good news Walt got...

425
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:47,631
...different circumstances,
but we were happy...

426
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,466
...we were over the moon.

427
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:52,928
And right then, I got sick.

428
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:56,140
Flu.
Knocked me on my ass for days.

429
00:37:56,348 --> 00:37:59,226
Couldn't get out of bed,
I couldn't move.

430
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:02,313
- Great timing, huh?
- Yeah.

431
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:07,359
And I wasn't even putting two
and two together. I was just thinking:

432
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:09,153
"Why now?"

433
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:14,199
Being that rock.

434
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:16,827
You know...

435
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:21,749
...being that rock
takes everything you got.

436
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,590
Yeah.

437
00:39:25,854 --> 00:39:27,856
<i>- -Causing the housing prices
to trend.</i>

438
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:31,568
<i>Foreclosures are being fuelled
by a spike in...</i>

439
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:38,784
<i>The economy is rapidly deteriorating
and unemployment is climbing.</i>

440
00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:42,746
<i>With Americans losing money over
rising inflation and tight spending...</i>

441
00:39:42,955 --> 00:39:45,416
<i>...the housing market
is unlikely to rebound...</i>

442
00:39:45,624 --> 00:39:48,294
<i>...spelling more pain
for the economy.</i>

443
00:39:57,511 --> 00:39:59,096
Yeah.

444
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:19,867
Are you going to work today?

445
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,413
Skyler, there's rot.

446
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,965
I'm going back.

447
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:11,270
All right. We'll take care of that
tomorrow. Okay, good night.

448
00:42:17,484 --> 00:42:19,737
- Good night, Ted.
- Good night.

449
00:42:22,156 --> 00:42:24,158
Oh, damn.

450
00:42:26,452 --> 00:42:28,120
- Clumsy.
- I got it.

451
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:30,581
No, no, Ted.
You don't have to do that.

452
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:03,197
<i>Get organised. Storage containers
to meet every need...</i>

453
00:43:03,405 --> 00:43:05,991
<i>...big or small, on Aisle 3.</i>

454
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,870
<i>Stashing your stuff
has never been so easy.</i>

455
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,094
<i>Get a thicker, fuller lawn
in less than six weeks.</i>

456
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:28,472
<i>Why can't the grass
always be greener on your side?</i>

457
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:31,308
<i>Go to Aisle 10 to go green.</i>

458
00:43:36,939 --> 00:43:38,649
<i>Get a manager
on Check out 4, please.</i>

459
00:43:38,857 --> 00:43:40,985
<i>Manager to Check out 4.</i>

460
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:52,579
<i>Pest problems? No problem.</i>

461
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:56,583
<i>Your extermination destination
is Aisle 6.</i>

462
00:43:56,792 --> 00:43:59,003
You're buying the wrong matches.

463
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,672
- What?
- Those matches.

464
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,132
They're the wrong kind.

465
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:06,510
Red phosphorous is found
in the striker strips...

466
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:08,596
...not the matches themselves.

467
00:44:08,804 --> 00:44:12,516
You need to get the big 200-count box
of individual matchbooks.

468
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:18,689
More striker strips. You understand?

469
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,650
Those only have the one.

470
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:24,361
And don't buy everything
in one place.

471
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,821
Do it piecemeal.

472
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,491
Different items, different stores.
Attracts less attention.

473
00:44:33,412 --> 00:44:34,955
Are you following me here?

474
00:44:39,835 --> 00:44:43,213
<i>You've been putting off
refinishing that deck long enough.</i>

475
00:44:43,422 --> 00:44:45,966
<i>We have everything you need
to do the job right.</i>

476
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,640
- Thanks.
- Sure.

477
00:44:52,848 --> 00:44:54,892
- Next.
- Hi. Here you go.

478
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,257
- You didn't buy my stuff?
- No, I didn't.

479
00:45:27,466 --> 00:45:29,051
We don't have time for this.

480
00:45:36,642 --> 00:45:38,769
Hey, there he is. That's the guy.

481
00:45:56,578 --> 00:45:59,915
Stay out of my territory.
