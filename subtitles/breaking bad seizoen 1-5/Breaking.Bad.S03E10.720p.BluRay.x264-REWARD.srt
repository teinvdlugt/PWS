1
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,625
Surprised he doesn't
make us do that.

2
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,588
The pack totally has a pecking order.

3
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:14,509
And the head hyena,
he's the man, you know.

4
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,178
All the other ones have to,
like, kiss his ass.

5
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,514
I mean, literally. It's so gross.

6
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,850
They have to lick his junk.

7
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:26,521
I can't believe
they even showed it on TV.

8
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:34,612
Yo, if this is supposed to be all,
like, major-league and all...

9
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,617
...we should have equipment
maintainer guys.

10
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,164
And water boys, you know?

11
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,043
Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.

12
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,880
Get us a couple flunkies in here.

13
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,007
Treat us right.

14
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,480
Okay, 15 hours starts now.

15
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,983
I'm gonna hit it,
if that's cool with you.

16
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,861
- I don't understand.
- What?

17
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,154
These numbers,
they just don't add up.

18
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,574
Told you. Dude's totally boning us.

19
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,410
No, it's not that.

20
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:27,415
It's our output. We're off.
We're. 14 percent off.

21
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:31,878
Point one-four. That's, what, like...?

22
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,504
What does that mean?

23
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:37,383
It means we should be netting
more than we're netting.

24
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,179
So how far off are we?

25
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,765
It's not negligible.

26
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:51,397
Ball-parking at it, I'd say
we're a quarter to a half a pound shy.

27
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,359
That's weird.

28
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,445
Well, what about spillage?

29
00:03:58,614 --> 00:03:59,697
Spillage?

30
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,033
You know, when,
like, just stuff gets spilled.

31
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,118
Nothing gets spilled.

32
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,578
A little maybe.

33
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,371
Nothing gets spilled.

34
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,832
What about evaporation?

35
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,295
It wouldn't account for this much.
The materials aren't out that long.

36
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,297
What about the other one?

37
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,300
The drops, like on...

38
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,427
Like on, like, cold beer.

39
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,055
- Condensation?
- Yeah.

40
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,806
No.

41
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,061
Well, what about the crap
that gets left behind?

42
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,147
You know, all the gunk
we scrape out of the vats.

43
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,651
Gotta add up to like a gallon each.

44
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,070
Did you work that in?

45
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:44,158
- Vestiges.
- Yeah. Vestiges.

46
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,913
Bet that's it.

47
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,457
Bet that's totally it.

48
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,505
Hey, Mr. White.

49
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,132
Mr. White.

50
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,636
Are you okay?

51
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,472
Yeah. Yeah, why?

52
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,685
Nothing.

53
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,114
Are you coming?

54
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,950
Yeah, in a minute.

55
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,537
All right, see you tomorrow.

56
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,975
All right.

57
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,608
Shit.

58
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,361
Bastard.

59
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,208
Son of a...

60
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,807
Come on, you...

61
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,809
Come on, come on.

62
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,398
Son of a...

63
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,504
Come on.

64
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,511
Son of a bitch.

65
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,362
That's great.

66
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,350
All right.

67
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,916
You little bastard.

68
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,311
Shut the door!

69
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,481
- My ears are popping.
- Shut the door. Move.

70
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,359
Feels like on an airplane.
What the hell's doing that?

71
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,778
Positive pressure.

72
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,655
Positive what?

73
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,157
God, it frigging kills, yo.

74
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,035
- Well, just move your jaw around.
- I am moving it around.

75
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,329
- It's not working.
- Just yawn or something.

76
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,247
Stop acting like such a baby.

77
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,499
Damn.

78
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,044
What positive? Positive what?

79
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:15,507
Pressure. I've turned the ventilation up
to keep the outside out.

80
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,886
There's been a contamination.

81
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,388
Wait. What?

82
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,515
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hold up.

83
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,642
Something got into the lab.

84
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,354
So, what do we do?

85
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,688
I mean, do we...?

86
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,483
Wait. Wait. I mean,
shouldn't we be wearing masks?

87
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,403
No, no, it's not that kind
of contaminant.

88
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,239
So it's, like, not dangerous?

89
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,368
Mr. White, talk to me here.

90
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,789
Not to us particularly, no.

91
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,500
What the hell is that?

92
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,252
This is...

93
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,171
I made it.

94
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,843
So exactly what kind of contaminant
are we dealing with here?

95
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,850
A fly.

96
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,270
What do you mean?

97
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,065
A fly, like... Like, what do you mean?

98
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:17,027
I mean, a fly. A housefly.

99
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,615
Like one fly?

100
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,409
Singular?

101
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,370
- What did it do?
- It got into the lab.

102
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,705
I'm trying to get it out.
Okay? Understand?

103
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:35,254
No, man, not really. I can't say that
I'm really following you here.

104
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,924
Dude, you scared the shit out of me!

105
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,093
When you say it's contamination,
I mean...

106
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,554
...I'm thinking like an Ebola leak
or something.

107
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,805
Ebola.

108
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,558
Yeah, it's a disease
on The Discovery Channel...

109
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,811
...where all your intestines sort of
just slip out of your butt.

110
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,480
Thank you. I know what Ebola is.
Now, tell me.

111
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:58,485
What would a West African virus
be doing in our lab?

112
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:06,160
So you're chasing around a fly
and in your world, I'm the idiot.

113
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,621
Jesse, listen.

114
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:14,001
This fly...
No, any fly cannot be in our lab.

115
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,295
It's a problem. It's a contamination.

116
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,840
And that is in no way a misuse
of the word. Okay?

117
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:26,013
So in terms of keeping our cook clean
and our product unadulterated...

118
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,599
...we need to take this very seriously.

119
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,476
Now do you understand?

120
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,772
So is that your fly-saber?

121
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,651
This is a swatter.

122
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,529
And it happens to work quite well,
thank you.

123
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,033
Hey, what happened to your head?

124
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,701
Nothing. I'm fine.

125
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,871
You didn't hit it,
like really, really hard?

126
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,375
My head is not the problem, Jesse.
The fly is the problem.

127
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:03,175
You didn't happen to maybe try
our product, did you?

128
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:07,012
Jesse, I know this seems unusual
to you, a layman.

129
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,724
A fly. I get it.
It seems insignificant, right?

130
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:15,187
But trust me, in a highly controlled
environment such as this...

131
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,067
...any pollutant...

132
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,071
...no matter how small...

133
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,993
...could completely...

134
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,008
Hello?

135
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,887
What?

136
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,102
Were you here all night?

137
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,020
Have you even slept?

138
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,731
No. Jesse, look. I'm fine, okay?

139
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,192
Will you just please focus on...?

140
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,242
Okay, look, we're running late,
so let's just get started.

141
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,536
The sooner we do it,
the sooner we're done.

142
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,455
Fricking finally.

143
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,920
What are you doing?

144
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,131
It's time to alkaline.

145
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,467
Have you not heard a word I said?

146
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,929
No cooking until this fly
is dealt with.

147
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,390
Have I been speaking to myself?

148
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,809
The timer went off, yo.

149
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,146
How long is this batch gonna be
good for? An hour? Two?

150
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:43,150
The batch will be good for nothing
if we don't clear the contaminant.

151
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,319
"Clear the contaminant."

152
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:48,113
We're making meth here, all right?
Not space shuttles.

153
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,950
We're making nothing until
we catch this fly.

154
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,285
What fly? All right?

155
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:57,164
Where the hell is this fly?
Not like I even seen the thing.

156
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,667
Maybe your positive pressure blew it
out the door or something.

157
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,629
No, no, it is here. It is around, okay?

158
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,591
He's around, and I am not going
to expose this batch...

159
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,010
...to the open air and contamination,
period.

160
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,680
Now, you can leave me to deal with
this myself or you can help me.

161
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,016
But you are right.
We're running out of time.

162
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,810
So I need your answer right now.

163
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,194
Okay.

164
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:41,208
Hey, tick-tock, yo.

165
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,510
Look, I like making cherry product,
but let's keep it real, all right?

166
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:55,847
We make poison for people
who don't care.

167
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,809
We probably have the most un-picky
customers in the world.

168
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,561
No, no, no. No rationalizing.

169
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,856
We'll find it any minute.
Don't give up.

170
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:22,541
Did you know that there's
an acceptable level of rat turds...

171
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,877
...that can go into candy bars?

172
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,381
That's the government, Jack.

173
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:36,179
Even the government doesn't care
that much about quality.

174
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:43,395
You know what is okay to put
in hotdogs, huh?

175
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,440
Pig lips and assholes.

176
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:52,946
But I say, hey, have at it, bitches,
because I love hotdogs.

177
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:57,117
- And, you know, see what I'm try...?
- What are you doing?

178
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,120
Oh, hey.

179
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,458
Look, let me just top it off,
all right, really quick.

180
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,252
You know, a little sodium hydroxide,
shut the lid.

181
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,963
No harm done. Then we're golden.

182
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,304
It stays closed. That's an order.

183
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,810
You can't order shit, Adolf, all right?
We're 50-50 partners, remember?

184
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,194
God, what is your problem?

185
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,991
Freaking psycho.

186
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,494
- Jesse.
- Oh, God.

187
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,497
- It, like, hit bone.
- Jesse.

188
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,332
Jesse.

189
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,754
You see it, right?

190
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,298
You see it?

191
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,091
Yeah.

192
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,262
Get it.

193
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,849
You want me to get it?

194
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,810
Yes.

195
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,526
Slow. Move slowly.

196
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,779
I know. I'm moving slowly, yeah.

197
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:19,324
Absolutely. I'm just gonna need
your swatter thing.

198
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,038
Come on.

199
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,208
Oh, yeah. It's okay, come on.

200
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,043
Yeah.

201
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,671
- Yeah, come on.
- Just make it count.

202
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,716
Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna make it count, all right.

203
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,720
Okay. Now, on three.

204
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,347
Okay.

205
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:43,682
One...

206
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,226
Motherfuck...!

207
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:50,814
Yeah. You like that, huh?
Hurts, huh?

208
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,570
- Did you get it?
- I think so, yeah.

209
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,239
- Where is it?
- I don't know. What does it matter?

210
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,324
Who cares? I got it.

211
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,870
- Oh, Jesus, seriously?
- Where is it?

212
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,915
It's right there. Look.

213
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:13,253
Look. See? I told you I got it.

214
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,389
This is a raisin.

215
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,602
Look, I definitely got it, man, all ri...

216
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,522
Oh, man.

217
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,775
He's got some skills, yo.

218
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,527
I'll give him that.

219
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,696
Look.

220
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:45,785
I feel like I'm running out of ways
to explain this to you...

221
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,289
...but once more, I shall try.

222
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,418
This fly is a major problem for us.

223
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,296
It will ruin our batch.

224
00:20:56,464 --> 00:21:01,134
And we need to destroy it
and every trace of it so we can cook.

225
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,471
Failing that...

226
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,808
...we're dead.

227
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,065
There is no more room for error.

228
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,110
Not with these people.

229
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,366
All right, how about we go
get some air?

230
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,410
"Get some air"?

231
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,996
Your answer to,
"We're sliding headfirst...

232
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,666
...into a massive crap..."
- Hey, hey, hey, Mr. White.

233
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,086
All right, I understand that the fly
is a serious thing now.

234
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,462
All right? I'm on board.

235
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,799
I'm just saying, you know,
maybe if we went and got some air...

236
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:44,678
...it would help us come up with a plan
on how to catch it.

237
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,598
Then come back down here
and subtract his ass.

238
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,997
- Oh, wait, do you have your keys?
- Yeah.

239
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,041
You sure? Last thing we need
is to get locked out.

240
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,169
Yeah. Hey!

241
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,047
If you're not gonna help me,
stay out of my way!

242
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,716
Hey!

243
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,933
Yo, yo, does somebody have
an ax I can use?

244
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,261
There we go.

245
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,018
Say good night.

246
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,606
Son of a bitch!

247
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,278
Son of a...

248
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:29,491
Damn it.

249
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,995
Where in the hell is that?

250
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,139
What the hell?

251
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,939
Need some juice maybe?

252
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,652
Knock yourself out.

253
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,070
It's a real one.

254
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,155
Yeah, like yours was working.

255
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,492
No, no, no.

256
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,661
Look, we're trying to decontaminate.

257
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,497
You don't decontaminate by
contaminating further.

258
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,833
What the hell is all this?

259
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:24,003
Here, how about this?

260
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,506
"Non-toxic glue strips."

261
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,968
Yeah, baby. It's got pheromones,
all right? I got a butt-Ioad.

262
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:33,596
We hang them up all over the place.
It won't be able to resist.

263
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,521
I sure hope we have enough.

264
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:45,984
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say yeah.

265
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,361
Do you see him?

266
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,949
How long do you think
you've been awake?

267
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,868
Why do you keep asking me that?

268
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:59,664
Just figure, you know, you could use
some coffee, is all. I know I could.

269
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,708
How about it?

270
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,128
Yeah.

271
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,550
- You take cream and sugar?
- Black is fine.

272
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,899
Why don't you just leave him be?

273
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,359
Let the traps do the work.

274
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:32,739
These pheromones are supposed
to kick ass.

275
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:37,744
Bet we catch this mofo any second.

276
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,383
Thank you.

277
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:59,432
You ever have, like, a wild animal
trapped in your house?

278
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:06,105
Not that I can recall, no.

279
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:11,444
We did, this one time,
back when it was my aunt's house...

280
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,739
...back before she died of cancer.

281
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:20,078
It was a possum.
Big freaky-looking bitch.

282
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:23,248
Hey, since when did they change it
to "opossum"?

283
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:27,460
What's up with that? I mean, when
I was coming up, it was just "possum."

284
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,130
You know, "opossum" makes it sound
like he's Irish or something.

285
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,884
I mean, why they gotta go
changing everything?

286
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,470
Whatever. It's just big rats anyways.

287
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:41,599
Giant pink-tailed rats
with their pink rat faces.

288
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:46,646
Totally freaky, like alien rats.

289
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,734
Actually, it's not so much
that he got trapped...

290
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:56,072
...but he was living there,
you know, under the house.

291
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,409
You could hear him going from,
like, room to room...

292
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,620
...always scurrying around.

293
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:08,001
Sometimes I'd see him outside at night
and it would just, you know, freeze.

294
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:11,587
I mean, it's like you're not looking
right at it, right?

295
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,632
I mean, it thinks it's fooling you.

296
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,303
That's what they do.
I mean, they play dead or whatever.

297
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,139
It's just so lame.

298
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:25,643
Is there a discernible point
to this story?

299
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:31,774
A point that you'll be arriving at
sometime in the near future?

300
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,154
It was just a total bitch to get out.
You know, it took forever.

301
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:42,952
Guy came, set all these traps and all
and he finally got it.

302
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,790
But my aunt, you know,
she didn't believe it.

303
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:53,129
I mean, she kept insisting
she could still hear the thing.

304
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,132
I mean, you could not tell her
any different.

305
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,470
She started keeping an old umbrella,
you know, by her chair.

306
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,723
Man, she would just bang on the floor
and yell at it.

307
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,225
Even gave it a name.

308
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:10,188
It was Scrabble.

309
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,647
Yeah, that was it.

310
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,568
You know,
"Scrabble, just knock it off."

311
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:22,075
She got like that toward the end.

312
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:29,665
Got obsessive about stuff.
Just got mad about stuff.

313
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,335
We didn't know what was up.

314
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,256
It wasn't like her to be that way.

315
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:45,848
But it turned out that the cancer
had spread to her brain...

316
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,351
...and that was why.

317
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:53,106
It metastasized.

318
00:28:54,858 --> 00:29:00,905
But it was good that that was when
we decided to take her to the doctor...

319
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,408
...because then we knew
what was up.

320
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,452
You know, got her some treatment.

321
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:10,456
Meds, so she wasn't stressing
all the time.

322
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,964
It was a lot better after that.

323
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,884
You know, she was a lot happier.

324
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,644
Where the hell is he?

325
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,656
I've been to my oncologist, Jesse...

326
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:45,658
...just last week.

327
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,413
I'm still in remission.

328
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,166
I'm healthy.

329
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:58,254
Okay, so good. Great.

330
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,382
Well...

331
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,760
...no end in sight.

332
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,014
That's great.

333
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,976
Well...

334
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,604
...I missed it.

335
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:27,033
There was some perfect moment
and it passed me right by.

336
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:33,539
I had to have enough to leave them.

337
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,042
That was the whole point.

338
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,545
I mean, none of this...

339
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:44,509
None of this makes any sense
if I didn't have enough.

340
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:50,223
But it had to be
before she found out. Skyler.

341
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,892
It had to be before that.

342
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,730
Perfect moment for what?

343
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,067
To drop dead?

344
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,529
What, you saying you wanna die?

345
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:11,744
I'm saying I've lived too long.

346
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:14,914
I mean...

347
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:19,418
...you want them to actually miss you,
you know?

348
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:24,882
You want their memories of you
to be...

349
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,595
But she just won't...

350
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,765
She just won't understand.

351
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:37,687
I mean, no matter how well
I explain it...

352
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,898
...these days, she just has this...

353
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,608
This...

354
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,907
I mean, I truly believe there exists
some combination of words.

355
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:55,788
There must exist certain words
in a certain specific order...

356
00:31:55,956 --> 00:32:01,294
...that would explain all of this,
but with her, I just...

357
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,380
I just can't ever seem to find them.

358
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,757
Mr. White,
how about you just sit down?

359
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,802
You know, I was thinking maybe
before the fugue state...

360
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,306
...but before the fugue state,
I didn't have enough money.

361
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,976
So no, not then.

362
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:29,155
And plus,
my daughter wasn't born yet.

363
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,617
It had to be after Holly was born.

364
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,452
Mr. White...

365
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,413
Definitely before the surgery.

366
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,334
Oh, Christ.

367
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,836
That damn second cell phone.

368
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,589
I mean, how could I possibly?

369
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,518
I know the moment.

370
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,484
It was the night Jane died.

371
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,866
Yeah, I...

372
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:20,122
I was at home
and we needed diapers...

373
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:25,044
...and so I said I'd go,
but it was just an excuse.

374
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:29,674
Actually, that was the night
I brought you your money, remember?

375
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,885
Yeah, I remember.

376
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:37,139
But afterward, I stopped at a bar.

377
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:42,561
It was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.

378
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:46,399
I just walked in, sat down.

379
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,988
I never told you.

380
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,908
That you went to a bar?

381
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,411
No, I...

382
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:05,584
I sit down and this man,
this stranger...

383
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,045
...he engages me in conversation.

384
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,214
He's a complete stranger.

385
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:18,931
But he turns out to be Jane's father,
Donald Margolis.

386
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,933
What are you talking about?

387
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,769
Of course, I didn't know it
at the time.

388
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,897
I mean, he was just some guy
in a bar.

389
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:31,277
I didn't put it together until after the
crash when he was all over the news.

390
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,446
Jane's dad.

391
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,449
I mean, think of the odds.

392
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:41,287
Once I tried to calculate them,
but they're astronomical.

393
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:46,208
I mean, think of the odds of me
going in, sitting down...

394
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:50,546
...that night in that bar
next to that man.

395
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,217
What did you talk about?

396
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,433
Water on Mars.

397
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,480
Family.

398
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:12,610
What about family?

399
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:20,618
I told him that I had a daughter
and he told me he had one too.

400
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,995
Then he said:

401
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,581
"Never give up on family."

402
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,336
And I didn't.

403
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,466
I took his advice.

404
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,817
The universe is random.
It's not inevitable.

405
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,028
It's simple chaos.

406
00:35:56,238 --> 00:36:00,991
It's subatomic particles
in endless aimless collision.

407
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,953
That's what science teaches us.

408
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:06,872
But what is this saying?

409
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:15,631
What is it telling us when, on the very
night that this man's daughter dies...

410
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:20,678
...it's me who's having a drink
with him?

411
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,058
I mean, how can that be random?

412
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:29,061
Hey, come on. Hey, sit down.

413
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:32,523
No, no. No, it's...

414
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:38,529
No. No.

415
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:47,079
No, that was the moment.

416
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,416
That night.

417
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,255
I should never have left home.

418
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,510
Never gone to your house.

419
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,351
Maybe things would have...

420
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:17,443
Oh, thought I was...

421
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:23,407
I was at home watching TV.

422
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,118
It was some...

423
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:31,749
Some nature program
about elephants.

424
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:37,129
And Skyler and Holly
were in another room.

425
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,968
I could hear them
on the baby monitor.

426
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,974
She was singing a lullaby.

427
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:02,154
If I had just lived right up
to that moment...

428
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:05,491
...and not one second more...

429
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,673
...that would have been perfect.

430
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,314
He's not coming down.

431
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,693
Must be Thailand-hot up there.

432
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,028
That's why he likes it.

433
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,824
Thailand's hot, right?

434
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,535
Yeah.

435
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:52,413
Then that's why.

436
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:57,793
- Oh, Jesus.
- Hey, hey, wait. Here.

437
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,560
He's not coming down.

438
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,939
He's staying up there forever.

439
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,383
What are you...? What are you doing?

440
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:50,220
What do you think?
I'm gonna get that bitch.

441
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,102
No, you're gonna break your neck.

442
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,688
Yeah, yeah. Just...

443
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:05,110
No, seriously, you're...
This is a bad idea.

444
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,197
Damn it.

445
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,948
Jesse.

446
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,283
Just hold onto it.

447
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,702
Hold it still?

448
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,259
Jesse.

449
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,307
I'm sorry.

450
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:39,394
Sorry for what, being a lunatic?

451
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,317
I'm sorry about Jane.

452
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,325
Yeah.

453
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,161
Me too.

454
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,915
I mean...

455
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:07,005
...I'm very sorry.

456
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,054
It's not your fault.

457
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:17,850
It's not mine either.

458
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,312
It's no one's fault, not even hers.

459
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:37,452
You know, we are who we are,
Mr. White.

460
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:43,125
You know, two junkies
with a duffel bag full of cash.

461
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:48,130
Like you said, we both would've
been dead within a week.

462
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,883
But I miss her, though.

463
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:57,097
God, I do.

464
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,231
Jesse.

465
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,692
Come down.

466
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,237
Wait. I'm so close.

467
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,867
Let it go.

468
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,244
We need to cook.

469
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,164
What about the contamination?

470
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,335
It's all contaminated.

471
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,926
All right, well...

472
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,887
...I definitely scared him.

473
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,724
Probably stay out of our way.

474
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,715
Yeah!

475
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,385
Somebody got got, yo!

476
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,720
Did you see that, Mr. Wh...?

477
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,853
Bins are packed?

478
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,522
Bins are packed.

479
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,691
How's the yield?

480
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:15,277
Two-oh-two and change.

481
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,863
You okay getting home?

482
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:21,533
Yeah. Better. Thanks.

483
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,618
Mañana, then.

484
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:41,219
Jesse, come here.

485
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,475
I couldn't chance saying it inside.

486
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:50,395
For all I know,
the lab's wired for sound.

487
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:56,526
That half a pound
I said we were off by.

488
00:44:56,736 --> 00:45:00,280
Now, I'm not accusing you, but if...

489
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:05,327
You understand?
And if they ever found out...

490
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,582
I didn't take shit.

491
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:19,174
I'm just saying that
I won't be able to protect you.

492
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,803
Who's asking you to?
