3
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,436
You can do this.

4
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:28,272
- You have reached Walter White.
- Please state your name,

5
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,776
number, and the reason for your call.
Thank you.

6
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,864
- Third try.
- Walt, if you're there, please pick up.

7
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:42,203
I really wanted to do this together,
but, um, l can hear him getting up.

8
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,580
It's not like l can keep him
from seeing the thing.

9
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:48,626
So I'm sorry, but I've waited
as long as possible and l...

10
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,504
I guess l'm gonna have to go ahead
without you.

11
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,383
So call me.

12
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,808
Hey.
Oh. Hey. Happy birthday, sweet 16.

13
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:05,935
Thanks, Mom.

14
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,396
Of course, l thought you
might sleep through it.

15
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:09,730
Ha, ha.
Hmm-hmm.

16
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,401
So since it's almost, oh, noon,

17
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,948
I think your first big birthday
decision is breakfast or lunch?

18
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,869
Um, pancakes?
Pancakes it is.

19
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,996
Oh, um, could you do me
a favor?

20
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,456
I forgot to get the paper.
Can you grab it for me?

21
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,500
Sure.
Thanks.

22
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,266
Surprise.

23
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,478
It's from me and your dad.
It's pretty slick, huh?

24
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:56,319
Uh... Yeah. Thanks, Mom.
It's, uh... It's great.

25
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,487
I really did a lot of research,

26
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,866
and, I don't know,
this car just really stood out to me.

27
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:06,662
It's got a ton of great features,
power everything, solid engine.

28
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,666
It's really roomy so you can,
you know, carpool with
all your friends.

29
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,086
And, of course,
it is safe because
I'm still your mother.

30
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,796
Oh. And it has a CD player,

31
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,799
so you can listen to tunes
while cruising around.

32
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:23,304
So you know what? Breakfast can
wait. You wanna take it for a spin?

33
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:28,017
Um... Maybe later.
I'm kind of starving.

34
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:33,814
Yeah, okay. Well, let's, uh...
Let's get those pancakes going.

35
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,403
Saul, he's here.

36
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:44,075
Bad idea. This is a bad idea.

37
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,826
Saul?

38
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,705
Send him in.

39
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:56,379
Mr. Beneke. Saul Goodman.
Thank you for coming down.

40
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,632
Hey. Yeah, hi.

41
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,717
Have a seat, please.

42
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,220
I, uh...

43
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,472
I don't understand why I'm here.

44
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,142
Something to do with my creditors?
Creditors? No, uh...

45
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,231
I'll cut right to the chase, Mr. Beneke.
I have some bad news.

46
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,067
Ah. Nothing but lately.

47
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,778
Your great-aunt Birgit
passed away.

48
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,947
I'm sorry, who?

49
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,699
Um...

50
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,827
Apparently she passed away
in Diekirch, Luxembourg.

51
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,413
And this was, uh--
Wow, eight years ago.

52
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,041
I just assumed you two were close,
given that, uh...

53
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,420
Well, maybe this is good news.

54
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,381
Ha-ha. Birgit left behind
a sizable estate

55
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:44,010
of which you, Mr. Beneke,
are the primary beneficiary.

56
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,219
What?

57
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:49,098
She had no immediate relatives
so the estate's just been sitting

58
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:53,060
while the folks over in the EU
searched for a living heir.

59
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,941
Well, I don't know of any relatives
in Luxembourg.

60
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,152
Definitely no one
who would name me in their will.

61
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,903
Huh.

62
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,489
Well...

63
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:12,580
Oh. Well, here we go. She left no will.
So that's probably why it took so long.

64
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,207
They traced the inheritance
to your father.

65
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,211
But having passed-- My condolences.
--you are the next in line

66
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:26,218
to the tune of $621 ,552.33.

67
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,058
Wow.

68
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,051
And when does
Don Eladio arrive?

69
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,263
Let's see how
the cook goes first.

70
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,431
Who's the chemist?

71
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,436
Is this a joke?

72
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,106
He's asking if you're the chemist.

73
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,482
I'm one of them.

74
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,652
Okay, we've all met.

75
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,113
Let's get to work.

76
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,016
Where's the phenylacetic acid?

77
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,103
Please show him
the phenylacetic acid.

78
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,480
We synthesize it ourselves.

79
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,774
All the ingredients are here.

80
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,904
They synthesize their own.

81
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,198
What?

82
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,493
I don't do that.

83
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,329
What's the problem?

84
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,708
Look, I get my phenylacetic acid
from the barrel with the bee on it.

85
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,045
That's how l know how to do it.

86
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,468
Mr. Pinkman was under the
impression that the phenylacetic acid

87
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:16,055
would already be synthesized
upon his arrival.

88
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,475
Any sophomore chemistry
student can make it.

89
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,811
What kind of amateur
have you brought us?

90
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,231
- What's he saying?
- We're working it out.

91
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,440
This is ridiculous.

92
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:31,445
I'm not letting some infant
who can't even synthesize
phenylacetic acid

93
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,197
teach me my business.

94
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,409
Tell this asshole if he wants to learn
how to make my product,

95
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,914
he's gotta do it my way.
The right way.

96
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,545
I speak English.

97
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,715
So you understand
what "asshole" means.

98
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:56,720
Now, go get me
my phenylacetic acid, asshole.

99
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,140
How long is it gonna take
to get him what he needs?

100
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:04,019
I don't know. I have no idea.
Several hours, at least.

101
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:08,232
I can wait. Gives us time to talk
about the state of this lab.

102
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,693
Don't you have standards?

103
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,071
I mean,
this place is disgusting.

104
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:18,867
All right, we're gonna scour every vat,
every tank, every cook surface.

105
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:25,708
We clean up every possible
source of contamination.
And only then we cook.

106
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,590
Who do you think you are?

107
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,680
I'm the guy your boss brought here
to show you how it's done.

108
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:43,017
And if this is how you run your lab,
no wonder.

109
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:48,355
You're lucky he hasn't fired your ass.
Now, if you don't want that to happen,

110
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:54,945
I suggest you stop whining
like a little bitch, and do what l say.

111
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,836
Clean up!

112
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,360
- You have reached Walter White.
- Please state your name,

113
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,488
number, and the reason for your call.
Thank you.

114
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:24,660
- Dad, you there?
- I'm outside. Are you okay?

115
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,205
I know you're home, your car is here.

116
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:32,376
You missed my party which feels like
something's gotta be really wrong.

117
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:38,590
I... l'm gonna have to call 91 1 .
I don't know what else to do.

118
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,520
Dad?

119
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:58,193
Uh... Come in,
if you're coming in.

120
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,034
What happened to you?

121
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,165
What happened?

122
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,589
I got into a fight.

123
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,926
What do you mean, a fight?
Like--? What fight?

124
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,889
Are you gonna talk to me here?

125
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,100
What are you doing?

126
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,644
I'm calling Mom.
Don't do that.

127
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,148
Look, I...

128
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,986
I appreciate that you're concerned,
but l'm fine.

129
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:53,790
Just do not call your mother.

130
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,668
Why not?

131
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,547
Because...

132
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,009
I was gambling.

133
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:10,682
If you tell your mother, l just--

134
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,852
I will never--
Never hear the end of it.

135
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,688
So please.

136
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:26,198
Can we just keep this between us?
Would you do that for me?

137
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:30,827
Just... Just keep it to yourself.

138
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:35,040
I don't understand.
How'd you get into a fight?

139
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,876
And with who?

140
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,643
I made a mistake.

141
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,319
It's my own fault.

142
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,327
I had it coming.
Dad,

143
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,538
it's okay.

144
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,252
It's all my fault.

145
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,047
I just...

146
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:32,848
I'm sorry.

147
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,516
Dad.

148
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,227
Come here.

149
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,898
Come on. Dad, it's okay.

150
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,901
No. Hey, hey, no.

151
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,072
It's okay. Come on, please. It's okay.
No.

152
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,657
Look at me. Look at me.

153
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,995
It's okay. lt is. Come on.

154
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:02,544
Come on.

155
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,090
It's-- It's okay.

156
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,513
Hey.

157
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,059
How was your birthday?

158
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,646
Good. Get some rest.

159
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,773
Okay.

160
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,735
The new car...

161
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,946
did you drive it here?

162
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,660
Yeah.
Mm. Mm.

163
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,995
That's good.

164
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,207
You like it?

165
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:46,546
Uh... Sure. l do.

166
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,883
It drives great.

167
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,761
That's good, Jesse.

168
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,942
Unh! Yes.

169
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,777
Yes.
Well done.

170
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,324
The first of many.

171
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,162
Yeah? What's that mean?

172
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,833
You're staying.
You belong to the cartel now.

173
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,886
You can't come to my work like this.
You're too recognizable.

174
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:45,016
Your face is plastered on every
bus bench within a five-mile radius.

175
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,020
Celebrities have to get their cars
washed just like everybody else.

176
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,565
I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important.

177
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,692
Okay?
What is it?

178
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,863
Well, I, uh, went ahead and met
with your Mr. Beneke. Right?

179
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,575
Which, I will say again,
loudly and for the record, bad idea.

180
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,537
Yes, but it is better than prison,
correct?

181
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:09,291
Marginally.
Which is why l disbursed
the funds as you requested.

182
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,584
All right, good.

183
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,169
Yeah. I can't believe
he actually bought it.

184
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,964
Great-aunt Birgit. What?

185
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,551
But you called it. People see zeroes
dance before their eyes,

186
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,762
it's like highway hypnosis.
So, what's the problem?

187
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,850
Let's just say, you and I don't
wear the same rose-colored glasses

188
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,060
where Johnny Fabulous
is concerned.

189
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,939
So I kept an eye on his bank
accounts, and pulled his credit report.

190
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:36,234
If you would, note the time on that.

191
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:43,116
Three fifty-four p.m. yesterday.

192
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:48,163
Three hours after leaving my office.
He bought a Mercedes SL550.

193
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,874
He's actually leasing it,
but he put 4500 down.

194
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,876
He's gonna pay 1 830 a month.

195
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:56,087
Fully loaded. He even got
the heated steering wheel.

196
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,258
But that's upwards of 6300
that won't be going to the IRS.

197
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:05,472
I just thought you might like to know,
loath as I am to say, I told you so.

198
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,146
Where is he now?

199
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,341
Hmm.

200
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,914
Hey.

201
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,874
Mm.

202
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,169
How you doing?

203
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,298
Good.

204
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,642
Um... How are you?

205
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:37,981
I'm fine, but your mother
is going to be worried sick.

206
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,483
I called her last night.

207
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,611
Oh, God.

208
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,699
I told her
I was spending the night at Louis'.

209
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,578
It's cool. So...

210
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,831
Uh, how are you?

211
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,336
I'm fine, son. l...

212
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,216
I...

213
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,553
Well, I...

214
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:12,891
I took these painkillers
that I had leftover from my surgery,

215
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,727
and I made the brilliant decision

216
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,272
to wash them down
with a couple of beers.

217
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:25,028
Not my most sterling moment,
I admit.

218
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,322
But l'm fine.

219
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,659
I wish I could take back last night.
It was your birthday.

220
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,621
This shouldn't be on your mind.
It's okay.

221
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:35,830
No, it's not okay.

222
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:41,628
I'm your father,
and I don't want last night to be...

223
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:45,882
I mean, you really...

224
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:50,553
can't think of me like...

225
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,598
Like what?

226
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,313
I don't understand.

227
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,035
My father died when I was 6.

228
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,955
You knew that, right?
Yeah.

229
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,585
He had Huntington's disease. lt's...

230
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,882
It destroys portions of the brain,

231
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,968
affects muscle control,

232
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:33,596
leads to dementia,
it's just a nasty disease.

233
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,348
It's genetic.

234
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,144
Terrified my mother
that I might have it,

235
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:43,940
so they ran tests on me
when l was a kid, but I came up clean.

236
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,570
My father fell very ill when l was...

237
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,905
four or 5.

238
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,783
He spent a lot of time in the hospital.

239
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,369
My, uh...

240
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,751
Heh. My mother would tell me
so many stories about my father.

241
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,005
She would talk about him
all the time.

242
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,466
I knew about his personality,

243
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,385
how he treated people,

244
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,804
I even knew how
he liked his steaks cooked.

245
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,598
Medium rare.

246
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,433
Just like you.

247
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:23,730
I knew things about my father.

248
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,398
I had a lot of information.

249
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:29,110
It's because people
would tell me these things.

250
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,572
They would paint this picture

251
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,033
of my father for me.

252
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:40,914
And I always pretended
that was who I saw too.

253
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,584
Who I remembered. But it was a lie.

254
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:49,380
In truth, I only have one real,

255
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,717
actual memory of my father.

256
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,972
It must have been
right before he died.

257
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,975
My mother would take me
to the hospital to visit him.

258
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,896
And I remember the smell
in there, the chemicals.

259
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,815
It was as if they used up

260
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:12,946
every single cleaning product
they could find in a 50-mile radius.

261
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:17,450
Like they didn't want you
smelling the sick people.

262
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,287
There was this stench
of Lysol and bleach.

263
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,165
I mean, you could just feel it
coating your lungs.

264
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:29,045
Anyway, there lying on the bed,

265
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,214
is my father.

266
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,093
He's all...

267
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,845
He's all twisted up.

268
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,058
And my mom,

269
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,520
she puts me on her lap.

270
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:50,316
She's sitting on the bed next to him
so I can get a good look at him.

271
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,696
But really, he just scares me.

272
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,868
And he's looking right at me,

273
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:06,582
but l can't even be sure
that he knows who I am.

274
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:15,049
And your grandmother is talking,

275
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:18,386
trying to be cheerful,
you know, as she does,

276
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,181
but the only thing
I could remember...

277
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,311
is him breathing.

278
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,648
Ah, this...

279
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:35,695
This rattling sound.

280
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,490
Like if you were shaking
an empty spray paint can.

281
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,075
Uh-huh.

282
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,750
Like there was nothing in him.

283
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,964
Anyway...

284
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:02,847
that is the only real memory
that I have of my father.

285
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:11,564
I don't want you to think of me
the way I was last night.

286
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:19,072
I don't want that to be the memory
you have of me when I'm gone.

287
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,868
Remembering you that way...

288
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,373
wouldn't be so bad.

289
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:34,253
The bad way to remember you
would be the way...

290
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,840
The way you've been
this whole last year.

291
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,303
At least last night you were...

292
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:46,349
You were real, you know?

293
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,192
Bye.
Bye.

294
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,223
Somewhere you should be?

295
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,354
Well, basically
it was a temporary hiatus.

296
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:37,066
But you give us two weeks, we will
be up and running 1 00 percent.

297
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:40,528
All right, you talk to your people
and get back to me, okay?

298
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,115
Hi.
Yeah, thanks, Tanya.

299
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:47,034
Okay. You bet.
Say hi to the kids for me.

300
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,203
Hey.
Hi.

301
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:52,623
Nice surprise. What's up?

302
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,293
Just thought I'd swing by,
see how things are going.

303
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:59,881
Well, things are, um...
Things took a turn. It's kind of crazy.

304
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,132
Oh, yeah?

305
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,135
The universe
is telling me something.
I got some good news.

306
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,387
Some very good news...

307
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,682
and, um, I'm getting
the business going again.

308
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,018
Wow.
Ha-ha.

309
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:14,228
I figure
we haven't been down long,

310
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,607
so we should be able to get most
of our old contracts back. Sit.

311
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,984
Oh, thank you. That's--

312
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,196
Um... Gosh, that's, uh...

313
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,156
That's wow.
Ha-ha-ha.

314
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,700
How is that even possible?

315
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:33,789
Well, I got a very unexpected
cash infusion.

316
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,041
Huh.

317
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:37,251
I guess someone's
looking out for me.

318
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,003
I guess so.

319
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,214
Um...

320
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,341
Is that yours, outside?

321
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,636
Oh. Yeah, well, you know,

322
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,804
I can't be driving a piece of crap.

323
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,015
You got to present
that successful image.

324
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:56,020
Right. So the lRS stuff.
That's resolved?

325
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,772
Yeah, it's in progress.

326
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,148
So you paid them?

327
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,484
Well, not yet, but I will.

328
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:03,528
When?

329
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,531
Well, it's not that simple.

330
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:11,827
Um... Here's the thing:
I never had proper legal counsel.

331
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,204
So I was thinking

332
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:17,250
I should hire someone good who can
maybe hammer out a better deal.

333
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,503
There will never be
a better deal, Ted.

334
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:23,005
The deal is you pay
your back taxes,

335
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:26,133
you pay your penalty,
and you don't go to prison.

336
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,303
That's a good deal. So...

337
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,222
Let's keep our priorities straight.

338
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:36,310
Well, my priority
is getting my business back.

339
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:40,940
And putting my employees
back on the payroll
so they can pay their mortgages.

340
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:44,402
Right. But l think
your employees would agree

341
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,738
that you need to get
your financial situation in control

342
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,032
before you can help them.

343
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,618
Boy, the IRS
got you on commission?

344
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,329
I'm just saying that,
though I really understand

345
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,499
the temptation
to restart the business,

346
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,543
maybe the universe
is telling you

347
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:03,254
that you need to pay
what you owe.

348
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,592
Skyler, um,

349
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,970
this is my money. Um...

350
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:16,017
Why are we having this conversation?
You're no longer a part of my life.

351
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,604
A decision you made, by the way.

352
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,065
So I don't understand
why you're hectoring me about this.

353
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,944
Ted, this affects both of us.
No it doesn't.

354
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,738
I'm telling you to drop this.

355
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,574
You need to use that money
to pay your bill

356
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,200
by the end of this month,

357
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,287
which you promised
the lRS in writing that you would do.

358
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,248
It is that simple.

359
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,834
Okay.

360
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,837
Okay, duly noted.

361
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,589
What does that mean?

362
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,301
Does that mean yes? Because
I really need a yes here, Ted.

363
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,638
All right, Skyler,
I'll tell you what it means. lt means,

364
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,641
in the most respectful way possible,
there's the door.

365
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,310
And I'm inviting you to, you know...

366
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,730
And thank you for your concern,
but l'm done talking about this.

367
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:35,763
From whom exactly do you think
you got that 600,000, Ted?

368
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,476
Great-aunt Birgit?

369
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,479
That was you?

370
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,232
Yeah.

371
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,479
What is this shit?

372
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,398
I don't get a vote?

373
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,025
I'm supposed to just
stay down here forever?

374
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,779
I promise you this:

375
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:38,117
Either we're all going home
or none of us are.

376
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,036
Now settle down.

377
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,710
On your feet.

378
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,478
Gustavo.

379
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,730
I'm so happy

380
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:53,192
you finally came to your senses.

381
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,035
May I present the cook.

382
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,208
This is your new employer.

383
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,252
You address him as Don Eladio.

384
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,671
It's a term of respect.

385
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:16,966
Hello, young man.

386
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,764
He doesn't speak
a word of Spanish, does he?

387
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,808
And he's no chemist,

388
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,476
I'll tell you that.

389
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,940
I don't care if he's a pig farmer.

390
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,944
He cooks better meth than you do,

391
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:41,156
with all your fancy
college degrees.

392
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:45,870
And this one will have
plenty of time to learn Spanish.

393
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,212
What's in there?

394
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,131
A gift?

395
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:07,516
Gustavo,
you're so generous.

396
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,852
It's a token of respect.

397
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,438
In honor
of our renewed friendship.

398
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,607
Mm.

399
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,034
Let's see what's in here.

400
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,875
No, impossible!

401
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:39,173
Zafiro Añejo!

402
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,050
Look at this.

403
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,762
Even the bottle is a work of art.

404
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,764
It's perfection!

405
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,016
Perhaps,

406
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,894
it's too good to share.

407
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,979
What do you think, Gustavo?

408
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,316
It's yours to do with
as you choose.

409
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:58,609
Aha.

410
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:03,864
I choose

411
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,908
to drink it!

412
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,967
Careful.

413
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,219
That's beautiful stuff.

414
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,054
If you spill a drop,

415
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,139
I'll cut off your hand.

416
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,516
Ha.

417
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,685
Come on, hurry up.

418
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,771
Gustavo.

419
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:44,154
Welcome to Mexico.

420
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,908
Now you say:

421
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,957
This one's an addict.

422
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,543
To work, he must be sober.

423
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,130
None for you! Ho, ho.

424
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,162
Aah. Mm!

425
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,205
Enough business!

426
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,166
Bring the girls!

427
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:12,076

Hey. Hey, you still with us?

Go.

471

Kid, get us out of here, kid.

472
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:12,769
Come on.
