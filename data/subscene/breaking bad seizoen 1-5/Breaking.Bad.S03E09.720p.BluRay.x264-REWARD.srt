1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:07,382
In the little village where I was born,
life moved at a slower pace...

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:11,386
...yet felt all the richer for it.

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:17,558
There, my two uncles were known far
and wide for their delicious cooking.

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,727
They seasoned their zesty chicken...

5
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:23,398
...using only the freshest herbs
and spices.

6
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,859
People called them
Los Pollos Hermanos...

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,653
..."The Chicken Brothers."

8
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,572
Today, we carry on their tradition...

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,784
...in a manner that would make
my uncles proud.

10
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:38,746
The finest ingredients are brought
together with loving care...

11
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:42,375
...then slow-cooked to perfection.

12
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:47,880
Yes, the old ways are still best
at Los Pollos Hermanos.

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:53,469
But don't take my word for it.
One taste and you'll know.

14
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,998
Two-oh-one-point-six.

15
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,292
Jesus, seriously.

16
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,711
Better over than under.

17
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,047
Over by a pound and a half.

18
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,800
I thought you were all, like, precise.

19
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,345
Whatever.
We'll just save it out till next week.

20
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,389
We ship it as is.

21
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:05,601
What, are we running a charity?
Come on, man. We're gonna take it out.

22
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,312
Leave it. One batch, one ship.

23
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,065
Stop complicating things.

24
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,366
Why are you purposely giving him
free meth?

25
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,870
These bitches are bleeding us
enough already.

26
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,539
You are paid extraordinarily well.

27
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,585
- Why can't you just appreciate that?
- Yeah. Hey, I been crunching numbers.

28
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,087
- Oh, you've been crunching numbers?
- Yeah.

29
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,756
And I don't gotta be a mathematician
to figure out...

30
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,967
...that this deal you made is bullshit.

31
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,636
- We both earn...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

32
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,973
A million and a half each.

33
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,144
What's he getting, huh?

34
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,356
Say he's wholesaling at
40 large a pound.

35
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,108
That's probably high.

36
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,778
High. What, for our stuff?
That's what I was getting.

37
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,448
All right, look,
say he's getting 40 a pound.

38
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,743
All right, 200 pounds a week
for three months.

39
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,788
And, like, what happens at the end
of the three months? Look, whatever.

40
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,959
Two hundred pounds a week
for three months. That's 2400 pounds.

41
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,128
Twenty-four hundred
times 40,000 is...

42
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,381
And I swear to God,
I double-checked this like 10 times.

43
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:23,387
Ninety-six million dollars.

44
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,474
All right? Ninety-six million.

45
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,477
Ninety-six to our three.

46
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,479
That is messed up, yo.

47
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,648
That is so messed up.

48
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,400
- Fairness-wise, I can't even...
- Jesse.

49
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,156
You are now a millionaire
and you're complaining?

50
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,326
What world do you live in?

51
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:50,414
One where the dudes who are actually
doing all the work ain't getting fisted.

52
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,500
What is going on with you lately?

53
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,794
What's happened to you?

54
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,505
Hang on, can't we just...?

55
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,675
Hey, we gotta hash this out.

56
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:05,054
Hey, what's more important
than money?

57
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,518
These things they laughingly
call pillows...

58
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,562
...I would not give them
to prison inmates.

59
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,690
You want me to go ask for another?

60
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,985
No, just remind me to bring his
from home.

61
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,698
They're not moving his legs enough.

62
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,032
Hey, everybody.

63
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:33,582
Hi, Marie. Is it okay if I visit?

64
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,005
Yeah.

65
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,600
His color looks good.

66
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,897
Gomey, is that you?

67
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,025
Buddy, yeah, it's me.

68
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,986
That's you, Gomey?

69
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,031
Yeah, Hank. I'm right here.

70
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,700
Come here. Closer.

71
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,872
- What is it?
- Closer.

72
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,918
Asshole.

73
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,298
Man, he got you good.

74
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,592
Yeah, yeah.

75
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,596
I'm glad to see you still have
your twisted sense of humor.

76
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,932
God.

77
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,938
Hey, check this out.

78
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,317
I got something
that'll make you feel better.

79
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,821
Been keeping an eye on that blue meth
of yours. Six, seven weeks, nothing.

80
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,824
Then all of a sudden, boom,
it's popping up everywhere.

81
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:54,747
Look at the new locations.
Texas, Nevada, up in Farmington.

82
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,540
Even right here in town.

83
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,086
A teener here and there, you know,
strictly street-level amounts.

84
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,837
Man, it's crazy.

85
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,925
How exactly is that supposed
to make me feel better?

86
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,052
Because you were right.

87
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,346
You're the only one that
saw this coming.

88
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,972
Well, three cheers for me.

89
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,937
This thing doesn't do a damn thing.

90
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,481
Hank, it's probably still on lock-out.

91
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,149
It's been an hour, right?

92
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,778
I'm hurting here.
I could use some meds.

93
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,614
I'll go find somebody.

94
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,576
Hey, no more shop talk.

95
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,328
Sorry.

96
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,835
I didn't see it coming.

97
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,088
What? Damn right, you did.

98
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,465
No, I didn't see shit.

99
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,010
Day late and dollar short, as usual.

100
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,393
The only reason I'm even breathing...

101
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,355
...is I got a warning call.

102
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,734
A warning call? What do you mean?

103
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:10,364
One minute
before they attacked me...

104
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:14,702
...somebody called my cell
and told me to expect it.

105
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,205
A voice scrambler.
Could have been anybody.

106
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:23,169
Marie's got my phone somewhere,
if you want to run the incoming.

107
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,339
Not that you're gonna learn anything
worth knowing.

108
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,925
I don't get it. Cartel hit?

109
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,888
- Who would have called to warn you?
- I don't know.

110
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,682
Oh, Jesus.

111
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,060
- Come on already.
- Okay.

112
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,772
Skyler, I had nothing to do...

113
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,112
Are we safe?

114
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,616
Yes.

115
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,003
Are you safe?

116
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,093
Absolutely.

117
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:25,749
Jesse?

118
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,460
What about you?

119
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,130
Face looks better.

120
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,508
How's it all going?
Anything you wanna tell us about?

121
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,179
What, like my interesting life?

122
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,809
One day pretty much bleeds
into the next.

123
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,270
Been working a lot.

124
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,648
- Got a job.
- Job is good.

125
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,694
It's in a Laundromat.
It's totally corporate.

126
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,029
Corporate Laundromat.

127
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,657
It's, like, rigid. All kinds of red tape.
My boss is a dick.

128
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,368
The owner, super dick.

129
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,205
I'm not worthy to meet him,
but everybody's scared of the dude.

130
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,875
The place is full
of dead-eyed douche bags...

131
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:12,212
...the hours suck and nobody knows
what's going on, so...

132
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,174
Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.

133
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,093
Yeah.

134
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,722
Totally Kafkaesque.

135
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,560
Majorly.

136
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,731
From the U.S. Attorney in Santa Fe.

137
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,067
Very nice.

138
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,111
You've got all these nice tulips
and baby's breath.

139
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,740
Oh, and this is chrysanthemum.
That looks like chrysanthemum.

140
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,742
- Yeah.
- Look at these, Hank.

141
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,827
- Aren't they beautiful?
- Beautiful.

142
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:48,248
Wow, look at the size of this basket.
It's got so many goodies in it.

143
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,960
Look, chocolate-covered pretzels
and cheese sticks...

144
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,755
...and some fancy designer olives.

145
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:58,550
You had me at cheese sticks. You're
gonna have to fight me for those, Hank.

146
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,261
"Get well and best wishes
from Ted Beneke...

147
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,056
...and all the folks
at Beneke Fabricators."

148
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,351
Wow, he gives you all this time off
and now this.

149
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,396
- Get me a job there.
- I know. He's great.

150
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,774
Boss hall of fame. I don't see anything
here from Kleinman.

151
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,360
They're gonna have to get
on the stick.

152
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,572
- How's everybody doing today?
- Good. We're good.

153
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,617
- How are you?
- I'm very good.

154
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,579
Hi, Hank. Just gonna do
a quick peripheral response, all right?

155
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,624
- See where we're at.
- Moment of truth?

156
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,793
Yeah, I wouldn't call it that.

157
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,171
All right, let's just take a look here.

158
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,925
All right.

159
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,470
All right, now I want you to tell me
if you can feel this.

160
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,643
All right.

161
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,812
How about this?

162
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,483
Okay.

163
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,611
How about now?

164
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,614
Do that one again, would you?

165
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,908
Right there?

166
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,997
- Yeah, yeah, I feel a tingle.
- Okay, on a scale of one to ten...

167
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,792
...ten being your normal level of feeling
and one being no feeling at all.

168
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,461
Oh, I don't know.

169
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,132
- Four?
- Okay, four. Okay.

170
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,803
And how about there?

171
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,931
Yeah. A six.

172
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:33,729
Okay, good. And here.

173
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,857
Yeah, still there. A little less.

174
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,359
- A three.
- Okay.

175
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,737
All right, good.

176
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,198
Thank you very much, Hank.
Did good.

177
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,993
So this is good news, right?

178
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,536
Oh, yeah, definitely.

179
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,079
Gosh.

180
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,833
It looks like some nerve function
is returning.

181
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,877
Oh, thank God.

182
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,714
All right, so when do we get him
walking again?

183
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:11,391
Marie, it's important
that we manage our expectations.

184
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,061
We're talking about months
of very hard work.

185
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,356
And even then,
the odds, they're not great.

186
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,566
But you can't know for sure.

187
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,402
- No.
- When does he start physical therapy?

188
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,738
We've sent the paperwork
to your insurance.

189
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:28,909
It's high-priority. We should have
pre-authorization in the next few days.

190
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,744
Certainly by early next week.

191
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,371
Next week?

192
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,998
No, that's not gonna do it.

193
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,625
I've looked into this.

194
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,587
And the sooner physical therapy
begins, the better his chances are.

195
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:44,091
He needs daily sessions.
Isn't that right?

196
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,259
- Well...
- Actually...

197
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,595
...your plan's treatment program
covers four sessions a week.

198
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:52,766
Actually, she asked the doctor.

199
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:58,272
Plan-wise, four treatments a week
is fairly typical.

200
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,525
And the therapists in your network
are mostly fine.

201
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,444
Mostly fine. Okay, well,
there's a ringing endorsement.

202
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:12,327
Look, if Hank had more physical
therapy with better therapists...

203
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,247
...wouldn't it be more likely
he would walk?

204
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,294
It's very hard to say, Marie.

205
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,798
Is the health plan's way
medically justifiable? Sure.

206
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,259
Is it absolutely optimal?

207
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,345
You know, screw it.

208
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,057
I'll make sure he gets what he needs.
They can reimburse me.

209
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,436
Mrs. Schrader, I get your frustration.
Really, I do.

210
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,815
But my best advice is stay
in the network. Don't go out of pocket.

211
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,984
Physical therapy is just
the beginning.

212
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,821
We're talking nursing care,
modifications to your home...

213
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,490
...occupational therapy,
medical equipment.

214
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,994
It could run into the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

215
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,787
So what?

216
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,290
We're just supposed to compromise
on his care?

217
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,710
Well, if you don't follow
the insurance company's procedures...

218
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,503
...they may never pay you back.

219
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,841
I've seen patients and their families
go bankrupt waiting to be reimbursed.

220
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,178
Who is the best physical therapist
that you know?

221
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,513
I can give you some names.

222
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,849
But they're not likely to be
on your plan.

223
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,309
To hell with the plan.

224
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,332
There he is. Finally.
I went ahead and started without you.

225
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,543
Ladies, this is Jesse-san.
He's in for the full treatment.

226
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,545
Hey, kick off your shoes. Lay back.

227
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,256
- Exfoliate.
- Maybe later.

228
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,634
Where's the maestro,
out parking the minivan?

229
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,219
Do I look like his shadow?

230
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:55,055
Who cares where he's at?
What am I doing here?

231
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,183
Well, I was gonna have you two
flip a coin.

232
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:03,647
But since the genius can't be bothered,
today's your lucky day.

233
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,233
Look around, kiddo. It's all yours.

234
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,901
What?

235
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,238
- This?
- Yeah.

236
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:14,741
You are now the owner
of this fine establishment.

237
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,535
- For free?
- Free?

238
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:21,164
Oh, ladies, cover your ears.
No, not free.

239
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,459
Look, hey, this is a squeaky-clean,
highly profitable...

240
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:25,961
At least potentially.

241
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,715
- Local institution looked upon with
favor by the Chamber of Commerce...

242
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:34,052
...Better Business Bureau.
At $312,000, it's a steal.

243
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,596
Three-hundred-and-twelve thousand?

244
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,434
Don't you get it? On the outside,
it's a nail salon, right?

245
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:46,064
On the inside, it's the best money
laundry a growing boy could ask for.

246
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,569
Wait, wait, wait. Hey.

247
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,572
Ladies, thank you. Thank you.
Good job. Come back here.

248
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,200
Sit. Come on, come on.

249
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,953
Humor me here for a second.

250
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,749
Now, you know you need to launder
your money, right?

251
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,794
Do you understand the basics of it,
placement, layering, integration?

252
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,922
I ain't buying no damn nail salon,
so just forget it.

253
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,758
Don't you want to stay out of jail?

254
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,343
I mean, you wanna keep your money
and your freedom.

255
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,138
Because I got three little letters
for you: IRS.

256
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,807
If they can get Capone,
they can get you.

257
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:25,270
Hey, look. Here's you, right?
Pink, Pinkman. Get it?

258
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,147
Okay, here's your cash.

259
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,317
You're out on the town.
Yeah, you're partying hearty.

260
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:34,279
You're knocking boots
with the chicky babes. Oh, who's this?

261
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,115
It's the tax man.
And he's looking at you.

262
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,658
Now, what does he see?

263
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,495
He sees a young fellow
with a big fancy house...

264
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,331
...unlimited cash supply and no job.

265
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,793
Now, what is the conclusion
the tax man makes?

266
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:51,129
- I'm a drug dealer.
- Wrong.

267
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,674
Million times worse.
You're a tax cheat.

268
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,177
What do they do?
They take every penny...

269
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,555
...and you go in the can
for felony tax evasion.

270
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,350
What was your mistake?

271
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,977
You didn't launder your money.

272
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,773
Now, you give me your money, okay?
That's called placement.

273
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,818
Hand me that little thing... Bin.

274
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,154
This is the nail salon, right?

275
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:22,285
I take your dirty money and I slip it
into the salon's nice clean cash flow.

276
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,204
That's called layering.

277
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,039
Final step, integration.

278
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,709
The revenues from the salon
go to the owner. That's you.

279
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,921
Your filthy drug money
has been transformed...

280
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,799
...into nice, clean, taxable income...

281
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:40,053
...brought to you by a savvy investment
in a thriving business.

282
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,559
So you want me to buy this place
so I can pay taxes.

283
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,185
I'm a criminal, yo.

284
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:52,899
Yeah, and if you wanna stay a criminal
and not become, say, a convict...

285
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,694
...maybe you should grow up
and listen to your lawyer.

286
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,947
Right, so you can get your 5 percent.

287
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,199
No, that's 17 percent.

288
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,578
I heard you say 5.
You said it right in front of me.

289
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,081
Yeah, that was for your partner.
It's privileges of seniority and all.

290
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,918
But for you, it's the usual,
17 percent and that's a bargain.

291
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,879
Hey, what? You... Hey, listen...

292
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,050
Come on, I'm talking to you about
your future here. Listen to reason.

293
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,135
How is your brother-in-law?

294
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,306
He'll live.

295
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,769
Good. I'm glad.

296
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:16,024
Walter, you seem troubled.

297
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,151
How can I help you?

298
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:26,660
I asked to see you in order
to clear the air.

299
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:35,460
There are some issues that could cause
a misunderstanding between us...

300
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:42,842
...and I think it's in our best interests
to just lay the cards on the table.

301
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,430
That's the best way to do business.

302
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,853
My brother-in-law,
moments before he was attacked...

303
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,523
...someone called to warn him.

304
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:02,195
I believe that same person
was protecting me.

305
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,367
Those two men, the assassins...

306
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,745
...I believe I was their prime target.

307
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,543
But that somehow, they were steered
away from me to my brother-in-law.

308
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,883
Because of this intervention...

309
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,553
...I am alive.

310
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:31,725
And yet I think that this person...

311
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,270
...was playing a much deeper game.

312
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,067
He made that phone call
because he wanted a shootout...

313
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,195
...not a silent assassination.

314
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:49,242
In one stroke,
he bloodied both sides...

315
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:54,789
...set the American and Mexican
governments against the cartel...

316
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:59,377
...and cut off the supply
of methamphetamine to the Southwest.

317
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:07,761
If this man had his own source
of product on this side of the border...

318
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,266
...he would have the market
to himself.

319
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:20,523
The rewards would be enormous.

320
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,908
We're both adults.

321
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:34,287
I can't pretend I don't know
that person is you.

322
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:42,087
I want there to be no confusion.

323
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,466
I know I owe you my life.

324
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,473
And more than that...

325
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,185
...I respect the strategy.

326
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,439
In your position...

327
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,068
...I would have done the same.

328
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:16,287
One issue which troubles me...

329
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:23,837
...I don't know what happens
when our three-month contract ends.

330
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,715
What would you like to happen?

331
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,803
You know why I do this.

332
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,682
I want security for my family.

333
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,183
Then you have it.

334
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:41,020
Three million for three months.
That was our agreement.

335
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:45,358
Extended annually, 12 million a year.

336
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,903
Call it 15.

337
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,989
Open-ended.

338
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,158
Would that be agreeable?

339
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:41,766
Part of the reason we talk about what
gets us riled up in our daily lives...

340
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:46,771
...is to help each other put a finger
on what our relapse triggers might be...

341
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,817
...head off our disease before
it comes back.

342
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,988
So, anyone?

343
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,451
Free license to bitch and moan.
How often do you get that?

344
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,165
Jesse, last time, you seemed down
about your job at the Laundromat.

345
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,378
Let me ask something. If you had the
chance to do anything you wanted...

346
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,171
...what would you do?

347
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,174
Make more green, man. A lot more.

348
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,386
Forget about money.
Assume you have all you want.

349
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,768
I don't know.

350
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:30,690
I guess I would make something.

351
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,775
Like what?

352
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,364
I don't know if it even matters...

353
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,493
...but work with my hands, I guess.

354
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:48,374
Building things, like carpentry
or bricklaying or something?

355
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:54,047
I took this vo-tech class in high school,
woodworking.

356
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:58,926
I took a lot of vo-tech classes,
because it was just a big jerk-off.

357
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:03,848
But this one time, I had this teacher
by the name of...

358
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,894
...Mr. Pike.

359
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:13,066
I guess he was like a Marine
or something before he got old.

360
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,400
He was hard of hearing.

361
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,905
My project for his class...

362
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:23,034
...was to make this wooden box.

363
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:27,038
You know, like a small...

364
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:31,834
Just like a...
Like a box, you know, to put stuff in.

365
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,755
So I wanted to get the thing done
as fast as possible.

366
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,050
I figured I could cut classes
for the rest of the semester...

367
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:44,764
...and he couldn't flunk me as long as I,
you know, made the thing.

368
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,767
So I finished it in a couple days.

369
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,230
And it looked pretty lame,
but it worked...

370
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,608
...you know,
for putting stuff in or whatnot.

371
00:28:56,443 --> 00:29:00,738
So when I showed it to Mr. Pike...

372
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,157
...for my grade...

373
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:08,121
...he looked at it and said:

374
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,791
"Is that the best you can do?"

375
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,919
At first I thought to myself,
"Hell yeah, bitch.

376
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:20,800
Now give me a D and shut up
so I can go blaze one with my boys."

377
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:28,683
I don't know.
Maybe it was the way he said it, but...

378
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,270
It was like he wasn't exactly
saying it sucked.

379
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:37,817
He was just asking me honestly,
"Is that all you got?"

380
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:42,488
And for some reason,
I thought to myself:

381
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,827
"Yeah, man, I can do better,"
so I started from scratch.

382
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,997
I made another, then another.

383
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:55,042
And by the end of the semester,
by like box number five...

384
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,045
...I had built this thing.

385
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:03,176
You should have seen it.
It was insane.

386
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:09,348
I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut
with inlaid zebrawood.

387
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,184
It was fitted with pegs, no screws.

388
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:15,438
I sanded it for days
until it was smooth as glass.

389
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:21,486
Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil
so it was rich and dark.

390
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,237
It even smelled good.

391
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:27,700
You know, you put nose in it
and breathed in, it was...

392
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,955
It was perfect.

393
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,374
What happened to the box?

394
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,215
I gave it to my mom.

395
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,051
Nice.

396
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,554
You know what I'm gonna say,
don't you?

397
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,765
It's never too late.

398
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,228
They have art co-ops
that offer classes...

399
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,897
...adult extension program
at the university.

400
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:01,984
You know,
I didn't give the box to my mom.

401
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,615
I traded it for an ounce of weed.

402
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,042
He's a hero.
You don't deny coverage to a hero.

403
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,127
They'll say they're not denying
coverage.

404
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,754
No, no, I'm agreeing with you.

405
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:24,590
But I went through all this with Walt.

406
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,802
You'll burn through your savings,
and then what?

407
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,054
Well, you two managed, right?

408
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,389
You said yourself...

409
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,934
...that Elliot and Gretchen's money
didn't cover everything.

410
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:40,439
- Jesus, I gotta get back.
- What? No.

411
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,024
No, no, no, you should rest.

412
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,152
Look, why don't you go in
and take a long bath?

413
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,031
- I put some fresh sheets on the bed.
- I wanna be there in case he wakes up.

414
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,243
With all they're giving him,
he'll sleep till morning.

415
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,248
- Hey, Sky.
- Hey.

416
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,127
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd stop by...

417
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:03,796
...to see how you're holding up.
Is this a bad time?

418
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:06,549
- Hi.
- Hi.

419
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:10,052
Marie, this is Ted, my boss.

420
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,554
Oh, you're Ted.

421
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:13,806
I've heard so much about you.

422
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,641
Thank you for your gift basket.

423
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,477
- That was really thoughtful.
- It was nice. Thank you.

424
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,479
- Cheese sticks.
- Cheese sticks.

425
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,190
You're welcome.
We care about Skyler so much...

426
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,152
...that naturally that extends
to the whole family.

427
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,363
Are you coming in?

428
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,074
Oh, yeah, you should.

429
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,328
- I'm sorry. Come on in, Ted.
- Thanks. Okay.

430
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,997
We were having some wine.
Would you like a glass?

431
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,000
No, no, thanks.
I'm just on my way home.

432
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,335
I just thought I'd...

433
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:47,173
You know, I am really beat.
I think I'm gonna take that bath.

434
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,800
It was nice to meet you, Ted,
and thank you again.

435
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:54,347
Nice to meet you, too, Marie.
Give my best wishes to your husband.

436
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,223
I will.

437
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,229
Thanks for stopping by...

438
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:06,859
...but it's actually not the best time
for a visit, so...

439
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:10,613
Can we just talk for a minute?

440
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,698
I know you need to be
with your family...

441
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:16,035
...but I haven't heard from you
in days...

442
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,037
...and I left messages...
- I'm so sorry.

443
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,873
You gave me all that time off
and I really should've...

444
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:25,211
That's not my point.
I care about you. That's all.

445
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:28,005
Ted, I...
It's just this whole thing with Hank...

446
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:32,426
...has been one nonstop horror show,
you know, so...

447
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:37,181
Well, I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

448
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,392
Thank you.

449
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,647
But I really do need you to...

450
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,941
- Okay.
- Okay?

451
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,906
Skyler, I gotta say,
your sister seeing me here...

452
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:59,161
...I mean, so what? I'm divorced.
You're divorced. So what?

453
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,956
Okay, let's talk about it later, Ted,
okay?

454
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,084
- Is there some reason for secrecy?
- Later. Not now.

455
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:08,546
- Skyler, just tell me...
- You really wanna do this now?

456
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,173
Are you gonna make me do this
right now?

457
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,306
Yeah, you're right.

458
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,976
Bad idea to come here.

459
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,688
Ted, I'm...

460
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,608
I'll see you in a day or two.

461
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:31,986
Back at the office.

462
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,614
Take as much time as you want.

463
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,459
I can't believe
you had to crush the RV.

464
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,628
Must've been, like, depressing.

465
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,506
For real. That's a stone loss.

466
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,467
No one misses it more than me.

467
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,344
Free to cook anytime, anywhere.

468
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,306
No quotas, no one to answer to.

469
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:04,935
What's the point of being an outlaw
when you got responsibilities?

470
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:10,232
Darth Vader had responsibilities.
He was responsible for the Death Star.

471
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,319
True that. Two of them bitches.

472
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,490
Just saying. Devil's advocate.

473
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,869
I gotta pay taxes? What's up with that?
That's messed up. That's Kafkaesque.

474
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,373
- Church.
- Right.

475
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:32,129
Let's kick it back into gear.
All right? Let's start slinging again.

476
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,678
- Let's do it. Life's too short, I say.
- Hells yeah, bitches.

477
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:44,183
We don't need no RV. All we need is
a bicycle, some Drano, soda bottles.

478
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,770
No, no. No shake-and-bake.
Where's your self-respect? Come on.

479
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,189
Ain't top-shelf,
but we could at least move it.

480
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:53,025
Still kind of dry out there.
It'll sell on the street.

481
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,277
And who says we sell on the street?

482
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,780
Maybe I know a whole new market.

483
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:01,033
Maybe all we need is the meth.

484
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,611
What's the yield?

485
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,865
Hey.

486
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,951
The yield. Come on.

487
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,454
Two-oh-one-point-eight.

488
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,766
I see a couple new faces.

489
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,853
Anybody wanna introduce
themselves?

490
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,356
Don't all speak at once.

491
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:21,947
Yeah.

492
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,620
So my name's Brandon.

493
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:32,124
Okay, Brandon. You wanna tell us
something about yourself?

494
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,502
Well, why I'm here...

495
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,089
...it's just one thing.

496
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,634
It's meth.

497
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,471
It's bad.

498
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,516
Thought I had it kicked a couple times,
you know.

499
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,770
But then, Jesus...

500
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,024
...this new version of it
hit the streets...

501
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:01,195
...and, wow.
- Not that blue stuff.

502
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,323
Oh, sorry. I didn't raise my hand.

503
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,492
No, go ahead. This is what we do.

504
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,328
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.

505
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,790
- You had it too?
- Yeah, bro.

506
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,334
I wish I never even heard of it.

507
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,295
It was like lighting my whole head
on fire.

508
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,131
Yeah. That stuff will burn you down.

509
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:26,303
Only reason I have a hope in hell
is because it's long gone.

510
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,180
That's the shame of it.

511
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:31,183
No, no, man. Don't tell me that.

512
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,352
I hear it's back in town.

513
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,942
Stay strong, brother. Stay strong.

514
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,820
It's gonna be okay.

515
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,004
I swear to God, I'll do it.
I will go to the press.

516
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,174
I'll go to 48 Hours. I'll go to Nightline.
Don't know if there's Nightline anymore.

517
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,594
Doesn't matter. They will all take it
and they will run with it...

518
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:13,851
...because he is a hero and he is not
going to be in a wheelchair at 43.

519
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,896
Jesus.

520
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,026
Listen, Marie.

521
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,904
I know Skyler's
already told you this...

522
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:30,200
...but if there's ever anything
that you need, anything at all...

523
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,245
It's good to have you here.

524
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,581
Both of you.

525
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:41,211
I just wish there was something more
that we could do.

526
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,887
Walt.

527
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,099
We can always pay their bills.

528
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,812
Please,
it's tens of thousands of dollars.

529
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:02,900
We have the money, more than enough.
Walt earned it.

530
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:06,153
- Skyler.
- I think Marie should know the truth.

531
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:10,282
Skyler, I really don't think
this is a good idea.

532
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,285
- I think that...
- He earned it gambling.

533
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,750
Walt and I...

534
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,295
...we've had our problems lately.
You know that.

535
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:31,095
And what it all came down to really...

536
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,264
...was money.

537
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,767
Pure and simple.

538
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,561
When Walt was diagnosed...

539
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,315
...it changed him.

540
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,820
And looking back, I don't think
I ever really understood...

541
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,489
...what it was
that he was going through.

542
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:53,283
It was more than facing death.

543
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,662
It was knowing
that he was gonna leave behind...

544
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,499
...nothing.

545
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,963
And so that's how this all started.
For better or worse...

546
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,674
...he wanted to provide.

547
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:16,098
And so he paid his medical bills
the only way he knew how.

548
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:21,186
I thought that Elliot and Gretchen
paid for your treatment.

549
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,397
Yeah, I thought so too.

550
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,900
The truth is he never took their money.
Not a dime.

551
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,530
He was too proud to take
what he considered to be charity.

552
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:33,699
Isn't that right?

553
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:42,124
So he put his mind to it and...

554
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:48,380
Well, you know how Walt is.

555
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,549
He's a problem-solver.

556
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:55,679
And he read books and he did
a whole bunch of research...

557
00:41:55,847 --> 00:42:00,684
...and he came up with this system.

558
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,728
A system?

559
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:07,024
A system for counting cards
in blackjack.

560
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:10,444
What do you mean, like Rain Man?

561
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:15,240
Well, I don't pretend to understand,
you know, all the details...

562
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:20,579
...but he was convinced that if he put
enough money into it, he'd have a...

563
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,664
God, what is it?

564
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,584
A statistical edge?

565
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,963
Yes, statistical...

566
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:31,924
- So...
- Yeah.

567
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:36,720
So he, every spare minute, Walt was at
some card table somewhere.

568
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:41,099
And at first he went to the casinos,
but then he realized that...

569
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:49,191
But then he realized that the casinos
report your winnings to the IRS.

570
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,944
And if it gets reported,
your family might find out.

571
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:56,281
If you do not want your family to find
out, you find another place to gamble.

572
00:42:56,449 --> 00:43:00,827
Like an illegal backroom game.

573
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:06,291
You remember all those long walks
that Walt used to take...

574
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:10,754
...all that time he used to spend
away from home?

575
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,842
I guess for a couple months there...

576
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,263
...you were sort of
leading a double life, weren't you?

577
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:24,935
Oh, my God.

578
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:29,273
Oh, my God, your fugue state.

579
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:32,484
- Was that some sort of cover?
- No, no.

580
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,820
He did not fake that, Marie.

581
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,614
The night that Walt disappeared...

582
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,663
...he lost $14,000.

583
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,168
It was his pension fund,
our savings...

584
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:55,674
...basically every last dime
we had to our name, gone.

585
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,011
He couldn't live with it.

586
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,138
He was suicidal.

587
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:06,184
But you have to understand that
as soon as he got out of the hospital...

588
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:12,065
...he went right back to gambling.
I mean, that's how deep this went.

589
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:17,321
How could you do that to her, Walt?

590
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,491
Anyway, this system of his?

591
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,829
He finally got it to work.

592
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,376
So all this is to say
we have the money.

593
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:34,546
No more gambling.

594
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,383
But we have the money.

595
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:44,681
How much money?

596
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,725
Walt?

597
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,231
Well...

598
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,364
...it's into seven figures.

599
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,743
Holy Mary, mother of God.

600
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,454
What can I say?

601
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,707
I did very well.

602
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,585
Marie...

603
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:18,048
...you will take our money.

604
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:22,427
Use it to take care of Hank.

605
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:27,099
Please. Marie, let us help.

606
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:32,437
- Does Walt, Jr. Know about this?
- Absolutely not.

607
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,648
And I need to keep it that way.

608
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,609
And Hank, okay? Hank's got enough
on his mind right now.

609
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:41,363
- Can we please keep this between us?
- Yeah. Yeah, I...

610
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,449
Yeah, I just... I need to...

611
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:47,786
Yeah, okay. We'll talk about it later.

612
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,498
How did you come up with that?

613
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,419
I mean, where did you possibly...?

614
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:59,464
I learned from the best.

615
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,180
Somehow...

616
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:12,602
...something tells me that Hank
is here because of you.

617
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:17,441
And I'm not forgetting that.
