1
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:32,411
Well, we've come a long way, Walt.

2
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,163
Here at the end of round one...

3
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:36,624
...I'm gonna recommend
cautious optimism.

4
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,960
We'll check back in two months,
see how you've responded...

5
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:43,005
...reassess and decide our next move,
if any.

6
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:45,966
That's right around the time
the baby's due, correct?

7
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:49,011
Yeah.

8
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,138
Well, try to think of this
as good timing.

9
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:53,891
You'll start feeling better soon,
more like yourself.

10
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,976
And your hair should start
to come back.

11
00:02:57,603 --> 00:03:00,689
Kind of gotten used
to the old cue-ball look.

12
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:05,236
- I prefer to think of it as streamlined.
- Right. Aerodynamic.

13
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:09,824
So no more confusion?

14
00:03:10,032 --> 00:03:14,537
- No more--?
- No. No. Absolutely none.

15
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:17,164
How are you two holding up?

16
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,459
Fine.

17
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:23,796
I mean, you know, we're busy...

18
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,674
...but we're good. Absolutely.

19
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:29,677
It's all good.

20
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:37,643
So we're not going through an insurer.
Is that correct?

21
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:39,729
Yes. Direct bill.

22
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:42,398
Just need to print it out for you.

23
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,426
Thank you.

24
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,605
I thought we had discussed
a cash discount.

25
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:25,441
Absolutely. It's included.

26
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,444
Just a reminder.

27
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:32,406
We do have a payment plan available,
should you be interested.

28
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:34,909
Oh, yeah.

29
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:36,619
Okay.

30
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:40,623
Congratulations.

31
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:43,626
Thank you.

32
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,432
Okay, well,
then what about the MRI?

33
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:00,684
Can you--?
Can you please explain to me...

34
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:05,106
...the distinction between
diagnostic and exploratory?

35
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:11,487
Yeah, but either way,
his doctor ordered it.

36
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,325
Okay, you know,
it should be covered.

37
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:19,328
You bet I will. Yeah, in triplicate.

38
00:05:19,537 --> 00:05:23,999
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
you couldn't be of more help too.

39
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,210
Yeah. Okay.

40
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:29,004
Bitch.

41
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:30,881
Hi.

42
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,511
Been around someone
who smokes?

43
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,971
No.

44
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:39,181
The hospital bill came.

45
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,350
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

46
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:45,646
Three-day stay,
13,000 and counting.

47
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:56,615
Is this something that
Gretchen and Elliott might cover?

48
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,535
I mean...

49
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:03,873
...I know it's strictly your domain,
but...

50
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:06,167
They will. I'm sure they will.

51
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,002
I'll handle it.

52
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,827
Oh, God.

53
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:49,914
Bring me up to speed on
Tuco Salamanca.

54
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:51,165
- Dead.
- Still?

55
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:53,584
- Completely.
- Okay, then.

56
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:56,337
- Well, thanks for stopping by.
- Okay.

57
00:08:58,255 --> 00:09:01,509
So things are quiet, you know.
Not a lot of crystal on the streets now.

58
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:04,053
- Good.
- Of course, that's not gonna last.

59
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:07,223
Wait to see who rallies the roaches
now that turf's up for grabs.

60
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:08,849
No takers so far?

61
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:12,395
Well, we keep hearing a name.
Heisenberg.

62
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:15,022
Lately pretty much every dime-bagger
we come across.

63
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:17,525
- Heisenberg?
- Yeah, I know.

64
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:20,403
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.

65
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:24,740
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking
that big blue we keep finding.

66
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:27,410
Anyway, we'll stay on it.

67
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:31,997
Know why sharks are at the top
of the food chain, Hank?

68
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:38,587
Because they have three sets of teeth
and will take a bite out of anything?

69
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:41,298
Some of those suckers
travel thousands of miles...

70
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:43,592
...in pursuit of their prey.

71
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,761
Yeah, I think I heard that.

72
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:49,932
You, my friend, are a great white.

73
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:53,060
How does Albuquerque liaison...

74
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:56,605
...Tri-State Border Interdiction
Task Force sound?

75
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:58,941
Like one hell of a promotion.

76
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,820
As of the 1st, I want you to split
your time between here and El Paso.

77
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:05,448
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

78
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,700
What you gonna do without me,
Gomey?

79
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:11,495
Celebrate. I won't have to look
at your ugly mug six days a week.

80
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:14,498
Hey, buddy,
I am the brains and the brawn.

81
00:10:14,707 --> 00:10:17,126
- I'm the whole package.
- I'm glad I didn't just eat.

82
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:19,795
I'm surprised your head still fits
through the door.

83
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:22,673
- You wanna grab lunch?
- Hell, yeah. Because you're buying.

84
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:25,634
Done.
I'll meet you morons downstairs.

85
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:27,803
Try not to get lost on the way.

86
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:30,014
Schrader.

87
00:10:30,222 --> 00:10:31,348
Yeah. Hey, Ricky.

88
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:34,185
How you doing?
Yeah, I'm stoked too.

89
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:36,062
Yeah, El Paso.

90
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:39,607
Here's the man.

91
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:44,820
- Hey, congratulations, Hank.
- Thanks.

92
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:49,802
Gets two in the sand,
two in the forest, you know?

93
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,305
And then he says,
"Give me a four," you know?

94
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,141
Hey. Hey.

95
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:30,968
- Hey.
- Got some nerve coming back here.

96
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:33,095
Or you're even dumber
than I thought.

97
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:35,431
Yeah, well, maybe both.

98
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:46,609
Balance for the tow, the repairs...

99
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:51,614
...and extra for damages and stuff,
the gate...

100
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:54,617
...the toilet.

101
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:58,162
Look, like I said...

102
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,248
...my word is my bond.

103
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:18,766
What would you charge me
to store this here?

104
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:21,894
- A million-five.
- Come on, yo.

105
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:24,313
- Your sister.
- Dog, I'm serious, all right?

106
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:29,151
I got storage needs.
And I got scratch up front.

107
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,779
We could, you know, negotiate.

108
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:38,285
Five hundred.

109
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:39,787
- A month?
- A week.

110
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,749
For real?

111
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,584
- See you.
- Wait, wait, wait.

112
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:48,003
Just hold on. Just chill.

113
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,717
Okay. Sounds good. Totally doable.

114
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:55,010
- Outside.
- Inside.

115
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:56,846
- Forget it.
- Man, come on.

116
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,099
Your fence is too easy to climb.

117
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,852
Inside, padlocked,
plus gate privileges.

118
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,022
- Come again?
- Gate, in and out, privileges.

119
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:11,944
Month to month. Cash up front.
Inside.

120
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:14,697
And I don't know you.
I don't know jack.

121
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:16,198
Yeah.

122
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,838
You selling?

123
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:32,965
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.

124
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,850
What about that one?

125
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:48,314
Serious?

126
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,671
It's Jane, right?

127
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,342
Well, Jane, I gotta say,
this place is awesome.

128
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,554
- Really? Does it inspire awe?
- No. I mean, you know, it's great.

129
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:23,182
Just what I've been looking for.
That's what I meant.

130
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,268
I had an entire house before,
detached and all...

131
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:30,815
...but I was just tired of the lawn care,
upkeep and whatnot. You know?

132
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:34,026
Well, the blinds are new.
Everything's been painted.

133
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:36,946
Jesus.

134
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:41,575
Utilities are included.

135
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:43,577
Stacking. Sweet.

136
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:46,497
- You got cable?
- Already wired. Just call to activate.

137
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:48,332
High speed, whatever.

138
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,210
Bathroom, cool tile.

139
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:53,254
Bedroom.

140
00:15:53,462 --> 00:15:54,588
Nice.

141
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:57,967
I'm a fan of the hardwood.

142
00:15:59,176 --> 00:16:02,430
- So you're interested?
- Definitely. Definitely, yeah.

143
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:04,598
And you're good with NP, NS?

144
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:08,352
Sorry. What?

145
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:11,731
In the ad? No smoking, no pets.
You wanna smoke, you do it outside.

146
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,859
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
It's cool. No worries.

147
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:19,155
All right, the usual drill. I'll need a W-2
or recent pay stub, current employer...

148
00:16:19,363 --> 00:16:21,949
...former address, you know,
the yadda yadda.

149
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:25,828
And if it's all copacetic, I'll call.

150
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:29,665
Yeah. Look...

151
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:31,333
...the thing is...

152
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:33,169
...I can...

153
00:16:33,377 --> 00:16:34,837
Unbelievable.

154
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:38,674
- I'm just currently between situations.
- Then I'm currently not renting.

155
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:42,511
Look, look, I got the money and
I'm totally good for it for, like, ever.

156
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,182
Come on, yo, can you please,
please just help a brother out?

157
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,976
Yo, my dad's not really
a make-exceptions kind of guy.

158
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:51,353
- Trust me.
- Your dad?

159
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:54,356
Owns the place. I manage it.

160
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:56,776
Pen on paper. That's what I need.

161
00:16:56,984 --> 00:16:58,694
Or go run your game
somewhere else.

162
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:01,113
Dude, I got nowhere else to go.
This is it.

163
00:17:01,322 --> 00:17:03,699
And I got no game, all right?

164
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:06,535
I just need a chance.

165
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:13,167
Look, my folks, they kicked me out.

166
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,337
I'm a disappointment, apparently.

167
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:19,423
Didn't meet their expectations again.

168
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:22,426
So you know, now
I'm persona non gratis or whatever.

169
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:26,764
But you know what?
I'm a good person and I work hard.

170
00:17:26,972 --> 00:17:29,392
I will pay you every month
and I will pay you on time.

171
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,561
I will not mess this up, okay?
I swear.

172
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:42,738
Rent just went up.

173
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:45,741
A hundred more a month.
That's the cash price.

174
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,493
Yes.

175
00:17:48,244 --> 00:17:49,745
Okay. Yes.

176
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:52,665
Hey, you rock. Thank you.
Thank you. You won't regret this.

177
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:55,584
And in addition to first and last,
I want two more months.

178
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:58,254
DBAA fee, non-refundable.

179
00:17:58,462 --> 00:18:03,008
Yeah, of course. No problem.
DBAA. Obviously, yeah.

180
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:08,931
All right. So, what's DBAA?

181
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,475
- Don't be an asshole.
- Gotcha.

182
00:18:11,684 --> 00:18:14,228
- I live next door.
- Really?

183
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:17,773
Don't think for one second you have
squatter's rights, because you don't.

184
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:19,525
If you blow this, I want you gone.

185
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:22,820
I know guys that'll have your skinny
ass out back by the Dumpster...

186
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:24,405
...faster than you can blink.

187
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:28,951
I'll fill it in. Just sign your name.

188
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,453
Which is what, by the way?

189
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:32,955
It's Jesse.

190
00:18:34,498 --> 00:18:36,959
Jesse Jackson.

191
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:39,128
Seriously?

192
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:42,006
What?

193
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:33,641
- What are you doing?
- Beating off. What's it look like?

194
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:37,311
That is in fact exactly
what it looks like to me.

195
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,606
Brewing is an art form, Marie.
I think you'd appreciate that by now.

196
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:43,818
Christmas, batch of '06? Come on.

197
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:46,195
So let me get this straight.

198
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:50,991
You call in sick the day after
receiving a long-awaited...

199
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,536
...career-boosting promotion...

200
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:58,040
...so you can play Oktoberfest
in your man cave?

201
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,626
I don't get it. Really, I don't.

202
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:02,795
Babe, relax.

203
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:06,340
- Please, don't tell me to relax.
- Sorry, I forgot.

204
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:08,551
- You know I hate that.
- Right.

205
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,511
Dave said I should express that.

206
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,431
All I'm saying is everything's fine.

207
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:15,975
I can take a day.

208
00:20:16,183 --> 00:20:17,893
No big deal.

209
00:20:18,102 --> 00:20:24,108
Now get that sweet ass out of here
so I can concentrate.

210
00:22:11,882 --> 00:22:13,676
<i>Okay, so, what's the plan?</i>

211
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:16,178
The plan is we cook.

212
00:22:16,387 --> 00:22:20,808
Why are we cooking when we can't
even move what we cook?

213
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:33,404
Well, how much do you think
you can sell on your own?

214
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:36,323
Say if I cook during the days
and you work the nights.

215
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:38,325
- Dude.
- What?

216
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:41,370
Prior to Tuco,
that was your plan, wasn't it?

217
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:44,999
I understand it'll be a fraction
of what we brought in before...

218
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:48,419
- ...but still, what choice do we have?
- First of all, there's no we.

219
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:52,715
Okay? You're talking me, solo,
busting hump slinging shards.

220
00:22:52,923 --> 00:22:54,133
I got profile now.

221
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:57,553
Don't you get that?
DEA's up my ass.

222
00:22:57,762 --> 00:23:01,140
No, I'm not exposing myself
to that level of risk for chump change.

223
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:03,893
- No way.
- Then what do you suggest?

224
00:23:04,101 --> 00:23:08,981
I don't think either of us are eager
to jump into bed with another Tuco.

225
00:23:13,778 --> 00:23:16,405
I got bills, man.

226
00:23:16,614 --> 00:23:17,907
You've got bills?

227
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:19,950
Rent, yo. Responsibilities.

228
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,952
I've already lost more than
I've made...

229
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:24,830
...and I am tired
of dicking around out here.

230
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,084
You wanna know how much
I've got left?

231
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:30,378
After completing
my first round of treatment...

232
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:34,090
...and financing
the world's most expensive alibi?

233
00:23:34,298 --> 00:23:36,258
Zero. Zip. Nothing.

234
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:39,553
I've got nothing to show for all of this.
Nothing for my family...

235
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:43,182
...which, as you might remember,
was the whole damn point.

236
00:23:46,936 --> 00:23:50,689
But seeing as throwing in the towel
is not an option...

237
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:53,943
...that leaves us with a total
of two choices.

238
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:57,196
We go into business
with yet another homicidal lunatic...

239
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:59,448
...or you and I start--

240
00:23:59,657 --> 00:24:03,411
You selling whatever you can.

241
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:08,416
There's a third way.

242
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,794
And what would that be?

243
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:16,716
We got to be Tuco.

244
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:19,301
All right? Cut out the middleman.
Run our own game.

245
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:23,347
So you're going to what?

246
00:24:23,556 --> 00:24:25,725
Snort meth off a bowie knife?

247
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:28,978
You gonna beat your homeys to death
when they "dis" you?

248
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:33,733
Look, I know some guys.
All right? I can create a network.

249
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:37,820
Look, we control production
and distribution.

250
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:41,240
That way, we stay off the front lines
while moving some serious glass.

251
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:44,493
I mean, the point here is
to make money, right?

252
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:45,995
Sky-high stacks.

253
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:49,832
- No.
- No? That's not the point?

254
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,626
No, I am not willing to do that.

255
00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:55,463
Who said anything about you?

256
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:00,634
I don't vote for this plan.

257
00:25:00,843 --> 00:25:05,014
I'm not comfortable bringing in
unknown entities into our operation.

258
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:07,767
Yeah? Well, you don't get to vote.

259
00:25:10,394 --> 00:25:12,521
I beg your pardon?

260
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,525
- This is a partnership, remember?
- I rem-- Oh, I remember.

261
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:18,861
Yeah, you cook, I sell.

262
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,364
That was the division of labour
when we started all this.

263
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:24,742
And that's exactly
how we should have kept it.

264
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,787
Because I sure as hell didn't
find myself locked in a trunk...

265
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:30,206
...or on my knees
with a gun to my head...

266
00:25:30,414 --> 00:25:33,376
...before your greedy old ass
came along. All right?

267
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:43,719
All right, I will admit
to a bit of a learning curve.

268
00:25:44,261 --> 00:25:46,847
And perhaps
I was overly ambitious.

269
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:50,101
In any case, it's not gonna happen
that way anymore.

270
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:51,977
Yeah, damn straight.

271
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:54,188
Know why?

272
00:25:54,397 --> 00:25:57,191
Because we do things
my way this time...

273
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,235
...or I walk.

274
00:26:02,738 --> 00:26:07,076
You need me more than
I need you, Walt.

275
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:30,766
<i>Yo, enter my casa.
Yo, Skinny Pete. What's up, brother?</i>

276
00:26:30,975 --> 00:26:31,976
What up with it, yo?

277
00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:35,438
Hey, Combo. Good to see you.
Welcome to my humble abode.

278
00:26:35,646 --> 00:26:38,399
Good deal, mover. Good deal.

279
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,612
- Yo, Badge, hey.
- Cool crib, man.

280
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:45,448
Hey, it echoes.

281
00:26:45,656 --> 00:26:47,283
Hello.

282
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:49,452
Hello. Hello, hello, hello.

283
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,370
Let me give you the virtual tour,
okay?

284
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:54,123
So plasma is gonna go right here.

285
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:56,375
Probably like 50-inch,
you know, wall-mounted.

286
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:58,794
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.

287
00:26:59,003 --> 00:27:00,671
No. They burn in, yo.

288
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,008
But the picture's, like, way sharper.
Blacks are deeper too.

289
00:27:04,216 --> 00:27:06,802
They got 3-D coming out,
like, any day now.

290
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:08,679
That's what I'm waiting for.

291
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:11,098
- Porn, coz. You know?
- Jesus.

292
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:13,809
Like 3-D tatas,
like right in your face.

293
00:27:14,018 --> 00:27:16,896
Yeah. So, I'm gonna get a couple
of those zero-gravity chairs...

294
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:19,940
...for, like, right here,
for your ultimate viewing comfort.

295
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:21,275
Those are buck.

296
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:24,487
It's gonna be pretty much sparse.
Very Asiany, modern stuff.

297
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:26,822
- Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.
- Yeah.

298
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:29,241
I'm thinking, you know,
just a bunch of candles...

299
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,869
...maybe one of those
little fountain jobs right here.

300
00:27:32,078 --> 00:27:33,871
- It's gonna be chill.
- The ladies...

301
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,833
...they cream up real nice for,
like, candles and shit.

302
00:27:38,751 --> 00:27:41,170
You are going to score, big time.

303
00:27:42,505 --> 00:27:45,841
All right, so how about we get,
you know, down to it?

304
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,178
There's some refreshments over here
if you wanna partake.

305
00:27:49,387 --> 00:27:53,015
You got any other refreshments?

306
00:27:53,224 --> 00:27:56,102
- I could kick it. It's been a while.
- Yes, yes.

307
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,729
I could totally go
for a loving spoonful.

308
00:27:58,938 --> 00:28:01,190
No, no, no.
No bomb, no beer, no weed. All right?

309
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:05,027
You smoke it up on your own time.
We're talking business here.

310
00:28:05,778 --> 00:28:07,863
Okay? So listen up.

311
00:28:08,072 --> 00:28:11,742
This is how it goes.
I front each of you an ounce.

312
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:15,871
You sell it for 2,500.
I keep the two, you keep the five.

313
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,833
No cutting it.
You sell it as is, all right?

314
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:21,502
Twenty-five hundred an ounce?

315
00:28:21,711 --> 00:28:23,212
That's kind of hopeful, bro.

316
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:26,882
- Yeah, Jesse, street's maybe 17, 18.
- Seventeen.

317
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:30,803
Okay, A, this is the best shiz ever.

318
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:34,432
All right? Everybody and their mother's
gonna want a taste. And second...

319
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,726
...who else is selling right now,
huh?

320
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:39,979
- It's dry out there, that's for sure.
- Church.

321
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:43,441
So you point it how you want, okay?
Quarter, half, teener, whatever.

322
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:46,819
But I make what I make.
Two large. No exceptions.

323
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:49,238
Short me, you're out.

324
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:51,031
Cut it, you're out.

325
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,867
Period.

326
00:28:53,075 --> 00:28:56,996
This is a big opportunity
I am giving you.

327
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:58,748
Understand?

328
00:28:58,956 --> 00:29:01,584
Badger, what is this?

329
00:29:03,794 --> 00:29:05,379
A big opportunity.

330
00:29:05,588 --> 00:29:09,050
Exactly. All right?
This is the ground floor.

331
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:12,762
Gentlemen,
how far you go is up to you.

332
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,430
So bring out the product, yo.

333
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:17,391
No, no, no. Not here, all right?
Not ever.

334
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,562
Blind drop. I will let you know
when and where.

335
00:29:22,938 --> 00:29:27,401
All right?
So you'll be hearing from me.

336
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,403
Now, I got mad volume.

337
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:33,282
So you move it quick,
you move it right...

338
00:29:33,491 --> 00:29:36,619
...there is always more.

339
00:29:37,995 --> 00:29:41,332
Okay, DBAA, mofos. All right?

340
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,751
Apply yourselves.

341
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:45,044
Hell, yeah.

342
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:47,254
Hell, yeah.

343
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:20,705
Hey, there's the big guy.

344
00:30:20,913 --> 00:30:23,165
- Congratulations, Uncle Hank.
- Hey, Hank.

345
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:24,542
It's an armpit.

346
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,502
It's not an armpit.

347
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:28,337
Oh, excuse me.

348
00:30:28,546 --> 00:30:31,090
You're right.
It's the Paris of the Southwest.

349
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:33,676
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.

350
00:30:33,884 --> 00:30:37,263
Right on the border
of lawless Mexican hell.

351
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:39,557
Human heads, they leave.

352
00:30:39,765 --> 00:30:43,853
The cartels, they litter the place
with human heads.

353
00:30:44,061 --> 00:30:46,439
Yeah, well, pretty sure
that's why I'm going there.

354
00:30:47,356 --> 00:30:51,277
It's like a calling card
or a shoutout or something.

355
00:30:51,485 --> 00:30:54,363
Now, D.C., on the other hand,
I could get behind.

356
00:30:54,572 --> 00:30:57,199
You just do your time
like a good boy...

357
00:30:57,408 --> 00:31:00,369
...and I could see us
in a cute little condo in Georgetown...

358
00:31:00,578 --> 00:31:02,329
...in a couple of years.

359
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:22,600
I went online to this fantastic...

360
00:31:22,808 --> 00:31:25,728
...real estate website for D.C.

361
00:31:25,936 --> 00:31:30,733
There's just so much,
I don't know, culture there.

362
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:32,985
I was talking to Melinda,
Hank's boss's wife.

363
00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:36,238
I told you about the one with
helmet hair and permanent lip liner.

364
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:38,657
Anyway, she was saying that
when they were there--

365
00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:46,040
Apologise.

366
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,794
What?

367
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:56,467
I will not listen to one more word
until you apologise.

368
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:02,264
- For?
- You know perfectly well, Marie.

369
00:32:02,473 --> 00:32:05,476
- Well, obviously I don't--
- Your lies.

370
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:07,269
To me.

371
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:10,815
The shoplifting.

372
00:32:11,023 --> 00:32:12,608
All of it.

373
00:32:12,817 --> 00:32:17,279
Did you really think it was all just
neatly gonna go away?

374
00:32:17,488 --> 00:32:20,574
Well, if you hadn't tried to return it--

375
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:22,618
Apologise.

376
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,124
Now or never. I mean it.

377
00:32:28,332 --> 00:32:30,793
Or it'll never be the same.

378
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:36,590
Why are you punishing me?

379
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:43,889
If you don't respect me enough to
apologise, to tell me the truth, then--

380
00:32:52,857 --> 00:32:54,817
I need my sister back.

381
00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:10,499
I'm sorry.

382
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,838
I'm sorry.

383
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:30,019
- What, do you want the gory details?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

384
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:32,021
No, you don't.

385
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:34,106
Keep you up at night.

386
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:39,987
So was it scary?

387
00:33:40,196 --> 00:33:42,740
Hell, yeah, it was freaking scary,
you little punk.

388
00:33:42,948 --> 00:33:43,991
Jesus.

389
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,078
But you were way faster than him.

390
00:33:47,953 --> 00:33:49,663
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

391
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:52,583
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

392
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:54,126
Kick ass and take names.

393
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:57,129
- Son.
- No, it's fine.

394
00:33:58,214 --> 00:34:00,174
You know what it is?

395
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:04,053
A cockroach comes out
from under a fridge, what do you do?

396
00:34:04,261 --> 00:34:06,180
I mean, you don't think about it.

397
00:34:06,806 --> 00:34:09,058
You stomp them down.

398
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,228
Where do they come from?

399
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:16,315
Criminals, like the one you...

400
00:34:16,524 --> 00:34:20,236
I mean, what do you think it is
that makes them who they are?

401
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:24,907
Buddy, you might as well be
asking me about the roaches.

402
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:30,329
All I know is there's a whole world
of them out there.

403
00:34:33,082 --> 00:34:35,918
Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.

404
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:49,844
Cops.

405
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:52,138
Cops!

406
00:37:49,987 --> 00:37:52,198
Wasn't sure it was you.

407
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:54,450
New car?

408
00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:58,454
Yeah, keeping things on the DL.

409
00:37:58,662 --> 00:38:01,791
I'm guessing
this one doesn't bounce.

410
00:38:09,006 --> 00:38:10,925
Your half.

411
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:13,594
Fifteen K.
That's what I'm talking about.

412
00:38:17,306 --> 00:38:18,849
You're welcome.

413
00:38:19,058 --> 00:38:20,101
Jesus.

414
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:24,772
Help me understand the math,
okay?

415
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,857
I gave you 1 pound, correct?

416
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:29,985
You and I split $2,000 per ounce.

417
00:38:30,194 --> 00:38:31,987
$1,000 each.

418
00:38:32,196 --> 00:38:34,115
One pound, that's 16 ounces.

419
00:38:34,323 --> 00:38:39,161
Sixteen ounces should net
to me $16,000.

420
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,331
Sixteen. Not 15.

421
00:38:43,874 --> 00:38:45,334
Something came up.

422
00:38:46,836 --> 00:38:48,170
Something came up?

423
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:51,465
One of my guys got held up
by a couple junkies.

424
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:56,262
Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay?
Skinny Pete's cool.

425
00:38:58,055 --> 00:39:01,016
So you're saying
that your guy got robbed--

426
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:06,564
Or rather you got robbed.
--but it doesn't matter.

427
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:10,276
Dude, it's called breakage, okay?

428
00:39:10,484 --> 00:39:12,194
Like Kmart. Shit breaks.

429
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:14,363
And you're thinking
this is acceptable?

430
00:39:14,572 --> 00:39:17,658
It's the cost of business, yo.

431
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:19,326
You're sweating me over a grand?

432
00:39:19,535 --> 00:39:23,956
Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here.
I'm not the street guy, yo.

433
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:26,417
But it seems to me
that what you call breakage...

434
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,712
...is just you making a fool
of yourself.

435
00:39:30,546 --> 00:39:32,757
I've got another technical
term for you.

436
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:35,718
Non-sustainable business model.

437
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:38,179
You're focusing on the negative.

438
00:39:38,387 --> 00:39:41,974
Six grand a day we're making.
What's your problem?

439
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:45,019
What happens when
word gets out...

440
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:48,647
...and it's open season
on these clowns you've hired?

441
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:51,776
Once everyone knows that
Jesse Pinkman...

442
00:39:51,984 --> 00:39:56,072
...drug lord,
can be robbed with impunity.

443
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,573
Man, come on.

444
00:39:57,782 --> 00:40:01,243
You think Tuco had breakage?

445
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:04,080
I guess it's true, he did.

446
00:40:04,288 --> 00:40:05,414
He broke bones.

447
00:40:06,332 --> 00:40:09,585
He broke the skull of anybody
who tried to rip him off.

448
00:40:09,794 --> 00:40:12,296
You want another grand?
Is that it?

449
00:40:12,505 --> 00:40:14,757
- That's not my point.
- Take it. Here.

450
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:21,514
Look, you got 15,000
you didn't have yesterday.

451
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:23,891
Hey, we're making bank.
Shit happens.

452
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,727
My guys get what they're up against
and they're careful.

453
00:40:26,936 --> 00:40:28,270
So am I.

454
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:31,190
And you're all tucked in at night
with your precious family.

455
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:34,276
So why don't you just stop being
such a freak about everything?

456
00:40:34,485 --> 00:40:37,363
You've made
the division of labour very clear.

457
00:40:38,823 --> 00:40:42,243
Yo, I mean, seriously...

458
00:40:42,451 --> 00:40:45,955
...what the hell
do you want me to do, huh?

459
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,191
Hey.

460
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,651
Sorry.

461
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,611
Wow, you snuck in.

462
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,905
Didn't even know you were home.

463
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:22,241
What you eating?

464
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,494
A panini. There's another one
in the freezer if you want it.

465
00:41:26,704 --> 00:41:28,414
I thought we nixed those, huh?

466
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:30,332
Did we?

467
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:36,005
Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones
with the off-the-chart sodium?

468
00:41:36,881 --> 00:41:38,716
I had a craving.

469
00:41:38,924 --> 00:41:41,093
Once in a while is no big deal.

470
00:41:47,224 --> 00:41:48,809
So where's Jr.?

471
00:41:49,727 --> 00:41:50,978
Out.

472
00:41:52,396 --> 00:41:54,523
With whom?

473
00:41:54,732 --> 00:41:56,192
Louis.

474
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:02,281
Out where?

475
00:42:03,783 --> 00:42:06,702
Somewhere. I don't know.

476
00:42:06,911 --> 00:42:09,705
- He'll be back by 9.
- Okay.

477
00:42:11,582 --> 00:42:15,252
Yeah, I just thought you might
have a clue where your son is.

478
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:17,046
Why don't you?

479
00:42:18,422 --> 00:42:22,551
Why am I the only one who needs
to keep track of our son?

480
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,179
I'll tell you what.
Wanna know where he is, ask him.

481
00:42:25,388 --> 00:42:27,640
Just pick up the phone like I do.

482
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:40,778
Great.

483
00:42:44,532 --> 00:42:47,743
Perhaps you might know
something...

484
00:42:47,952 --> 00:42:49,120
...about this.

485
00:42:52,957 --> 00:42:54,041
Perhaps.

486
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,086
And then again...

487
00:42:58,129 --> 00:43:00,339
...perhaps I don't, Walt.

488
00:43:00,548 --> 00:43:04,009
Perhaps I smoked them
in a fugue state.

489
00:43:07,138 --> 00:43:09,098
I'd like an explanation, please.

490
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:12,184
- You don't wanna go down that road.
- Why would you do this?

491
00:43:12,393 --> 00:43:15,438
- You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
- Three and a half cigarettes...

492
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:17,106
...won't do a thing to the baby.

493
00:43:17,314 --> 00:43:19,442
- Nothing.
- I'm glad you're so sure, doctor.

494
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,236
Three and a half. That was it.
I tossed the rest.

495
00:43:22,445 --> 00:43:28,409
And I'm sure you'll be very glad
to hear that, yes, I feel ashamed.

496
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:34,331
Skyler, this--
I mean, this is something that--

497
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,793
- This is so unlike you. Why--?
- Really?

498
00:43:38,002 --> 00:43:39,920
How would you know?

499
00:43:42,673 --> 00:43:44,759
No, thank you.

500
00:44:05,821 --> 00:44:06,947
Hank.

501
00:44:35,393 --> 00:44:36,685
Jesus.

502
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:20,730
Yo.

503
00:45:29,113 --> 00:45:32,408
You asked me what
I want you to do.

504
00:45:42,668 --> 00:45:45,254
I want you to handle it.
